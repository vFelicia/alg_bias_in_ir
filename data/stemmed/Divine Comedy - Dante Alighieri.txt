inferno
inferno canto i
midwai upon the journei of our life
i found myself within a forest dark
for the straightforward pathwai had been lost
ah me how hard a thing it is to sai
what wa thi forest savag rough and stern
which in the veri thought renew the fear
so bitter is it death is littl more
but of the good to treat which there i found
speak will i of the other thing i saw there
i cannot well repeat how there i enter
so full wa i of slumber at the moment
in which i had abandon the true wai
but after i had reach a mountain foot
at that point where the vallei termin
which had with constern pierc my heart
upward i look and i beheld it shoulder
vest alreadi with that planet rai
which leadeth other right by everi road
then wa the fear a littl quiet
that in my heart lake had endur throughout
the night which i had pass so piteous
and even as he who with distress breath
forth issu from the sea upon the shore
turn to the water peril and gaze
so did my soul that still wa flee onward
turn itself back to rebehold the pass
which never yet a live person left
after my weari bodi i had rest
the wai resum i on the desert slope
so that the firm foot ever wa the lower
and lo almost where the ascent began
a panther light and swift exceedingli
which with a spot skin wa cover oer
and never move she from befor my face
nai rather did imped so much my wai
that mani time i to return had turn
the time wa the begin of the morn
and up the sun wa mount with those star
that with him were what time the love divin
at first in motion set those beauteou thing
so were to me occas of good hope
the varieg skin of that wild beast
the hour of time and the delici season
but not so much that did not give me fear
a lion aspect which appear to me
he seem as if against me he were come
with head uplift and with raven hunger
so that it seem the air wa afraid of him
and a shewolf that with all hunger
seem to be laden in her meagr
and mani folk ha caus to live forlorn
she brought upon me so much heavi
with the affright that from her aspect came
that i the hope relinquish of the height
and as he is who willingli acquir
and the time come that caus him to lose
who weep in all hi thought and is despond
een such made me that beast withouten peac
which come on against me by degre
thrust me back thither where the sun is silent
while i wa rush downward to the lowland
befor mine ey did on present himself
who seem from longcontinu silenc hoars
when i beheld him in the desert vast
have piti on me unto him i cri
whicheer thou art or shade or real man
he answer me not man man onc i wa
and both my parent were of lombardi
and mantuan by countri both of them
sub julio wa i born though it wa late
and live at rome under the good augustu
dure the time of fals and ly god
a poet wa i and i sang that just
son of anchis who came forth from troi
after that ilion the superb wa burn
but thou why goest thou back to such annoy
why climbst thou not the mount delect
which is the sourc and caus of everi joi
now art thou that virgiliu and that fountain
which spread abroad so wide a river of speech
i made respons to him with bash forehead
o of the other poet honour and light
avail me the long studi and great love
that have impel me to explor thy volum
thou art my master and my author thou
thou art alon the on from whom i took
the beauti style that ha done honour to me
behold the beast for which i have turn back
do thou protect me from her famou sage
for she doth make my vein and puls trembl
thee it behov to take anoth road
respond he when he beheld me weep
if from thi savag place thou wouldst escap
becaus thi beast at which thou criest out
suffer not ani on to pass her wai
but so doth harass him that she destroi him
and ha a natur so malign and ruthless
that never doth she glut her greedi will
and after food is hungrier than befor
mani the anim with whom she wed
and more thei shall be still until the greyhound
come who shall make her perish in her pain
he shall not feed on either earth or pelf
but upon wisdom and on love and virtu
twixt feltro and feltro shall hi nation be
of that low itali shall he be the saviour
on whose account the maid camilla di
euryalu turnu nisu of their wound
through everi citi shall he hunt her down
until he shall have driven her back to hell
there from whenc envi first did let her loos
therefor i think and judg it for thy best
thou follow me and i will be thy guid
and lead thee henc through the etern place
where thou shalt hear the desper lament
shalt see the ancient spirit disconsol
who cry out each on for the second death
and thou shalt see those who content ar
within the fire becaus thei hope to come
wheneer it mai be to the bless peopl
to whom then if thou wishest to ascend
a soul shall be for that than i more worthi
with her at my departur i will leav thee
becaus that emperor who reign abov
in that i wa rebelli to hi law
will that through me none come into hi citi
he govern everywher and there he reign
there is hi citi and hi lofti throne
o happi he whom thereto he elect
and i to him poet i thee entreat
by that same god whom thou didst never know
so that i mai escap thi woe and wors
thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said
that i mai see the portal of saint peter
and those thou makest so disconsol
then he move on and i behind him follow
inferno canto ii
dai wa depart and the embrown air
releas the anim that ar on earth
from their fatigu and i the onli on
made myself readi to sustain the war
both of the wai and likewis of the woe
which memori that err not shall retrac
o muse o high geniu now assist me
o memori that didst write down what i saw
here thy nobil shall be manifest
and i began poet who guidest me
regard my manhood if it be suffici
er to the arduou pass thou dost confid me
thou sayest that of silviu the parent
while yet corrupt unto the world
immort went and wa there bodili
but if the adversari of all evil
wa courteou think of the high effect
that issu would from him and who and what
to men of intellect unmeet it seem not
for he wa of great rome and of her empir
in the empyr heaven as father chosen
the which and what wish to speak the truth
were stablish as the holi place wherein
sit the successor of the greatest peter
upon thi journei whenc thou givest him vaunt
thing did he hear which the occas were
both of hi victori and the papal mantl
thither went afterward the chosen vessel
to bring back comfort thenc unto that faith
which of salvat wai is the begin
but i why thither come or who conced it
i not aenea am i am not paul
nor i nor other think me worthi of it
therefor if i resign myself to come
i fear the come mai be illadvis
thourt wise and knowest better than i speak
and as he is who unwil what he will
and by new thought doth hi intent chang
so that from hi design he quit withdraw
such i becam upon that dark hillsid
becaus in think i consum the empris
which wa so veri prompt in the begin
if i have well thy languag understood
repli that shade of the magnanim
thy soul attaint is with cowardic
which mani time a man encumb so
it turn him back from honour enterpris
as fals sight doth a beast when he is shy
that thou mayst free thee from thi apprehens
ill tell thee why i came and what i heard
at the first moment when i griev for thee
among those wa i who ar in suspens
and a fair saintli ladi call to me
in such wise i besought her to command me
her ey where shine brighter than the star
and she began to sai gentl and low
with voic angel in her own languag
o spirit courteou of mantua
of whom the fame still in the world endur
and shall endur longlast as the world
a friend of mine and not the friend of fortun
upon the desert slope is so imped
upon hi wai that he ha turn through terror
and mai i fear alreadi be so lost
that i too late have risen to hi succour
from that which i have heard of him in heaven
bestir thee now and with thy speech ornat
and with what need is for hi releas
assist him so that i mai be consol
beatric am i who do bid thee go
i come from there where i would fain return
love move me which compelleth me to speak
when i shall be in presenc of my lord
full often will i prais thee unto him
then paus she and thereaft i began
o ladi of virtu thou alon through whom
the human race exceedeth all contain
within the heaven that ha the lesser circl
so grate unto me is thy command
to obei if twere alreadi done were late
no farther needst thou op to me thy wish
but the caus tell me why thou dost not shun
the here descend down into thi centr
from the vast place thou burnest to return to
sinc thou wouldst fain so inwardli discern
briefli will i relat she answer me
why i am not afraid to enter here
of those thing onli should on be afraid
which have the power of do other harm
of the rest no becaus thei ar not fear
god in hi merci such creat me
that miseri of your attain me not
nor ani flame assail me of thi burn
a gentl ladi is in heaven who griev
at thi impedi to which i send thee
so that stern judgment there abov is broken
in her entreati she besought lucia
and said thy faith on now stand in need
of thee and unto thee i recommend him
lucia foe of all that cruel is
hasten awai and came unto the place
where i wa sit with the ancient rachel
beatric said she the true prais of god
why succourest thou not him who love thee so
for thee he issu from the vulgar herd
dost thou not hear the piti of hi plaint
dost thou not see the death that combat him
besid that flood where ocean ha no vaunt
never were person in the world so swift
to work their weal and to escap their woe
as i after such word as these were utter
came hither downward from my bless seat
confid in thy dignifi discours
which honour thee and those whove listen to it
after she thu had spoken unto me
weep her shine ey she turn awai
wherebi she made me swifter in my come
and unto thee i came as she desir
i have deliv thee from that wild beast
which bar the beauti mountain short ascent
what is it then why why dost thou delai
why is such base bed in thy heart
dare and hardihood why hast thou not
see that three such ladi benedight
ar care for thee in the court of heaven
and so much good my speech doth promis thee
even as the floweret by nocturn chill
bow down and close when the sun whiten them
uplift themselv all open on their stem
such i becam with my exhaust strength
and such good courag to my heart there cours
that i began like an intrepid person
o she compassion who succour me
and courteou thou who hast obei so soon
the word of truth which she address to thee
thou hast my heart so with desir dispos
to the adventur with these word of thine
that to my first intent i have return
now go for on sole will is in us both
thou leader and thou lord and master thou
thu said i to him and when he had move
i enter on the deep and savag wai
inferno canto iii
through me the wai is to the citi dolent
through me the wai is to etern dole
through me the wai among the peopl lost
justic incit my sublim creator
creat me divin omnipot
the highest wisdom and the primal love
befor me there were no creat thing
onli etern and i etern last
all hope abandon ye who enter in
these word in sombr colour i beheld
written upon the summit of a gate
whenc i their sens is master hard to me
and he to me as on experienc
here all suspicion need must be abandon
all cowardic must need be here extinct
we to the place have come where i have told thee
thou shalt behold the peopl dolor
who have foregon the good of intellect
and after he had laid hi hand on mine
with joy mien whenc i wa comfort
he led me in among the secret thing
there sigh complaint and ulul loud
resound through the air without a star
whenc i at the begin wept thereat
languag divers horribl dialect
accent of anger word of agoni
and voic high and hoars with sound of hand
made up a tumult that goe whirl on
for ever in that air for ever black
even as the sand doth when the whirlwind breath
and i who had my head with horror bound
said master what is thi which now i hear
what folk is thi which seem by pain so vanquish
and he to me thi miser mode
maintain the melancholi soul of those
who live withouten infami or prais
commingl ar thei with that caitiff choir
of angel who have not rebelli been
nor faith were to god but were for self
the heaven expel them not to be less fair
nor them the nethermor abyss receiv
for glori none the damn would have from them
and i o master what so grievou is
to these that maketh them lament so sore
he answer i will tell thee veri briefli
these have no longer ani hope of death
and thi blind life of their is so debas
thei enviou ar of everi other fate
no fame of them the world permit to be
misericord and justic both disdain them
let us not speak of them but look and pass
and i who look again beheld a banner
which whirl round ran on so rapidli
that of all paus it seem to me indign
and after it there came so long a train
of peopl that i neer would have believ
that ever death so mani had undon
when some among them i had recognis
i look and i beheld the shade of him
who made through cowardic the great refus
forthwith i comprehend and wa certain
that thi the sect wa of the caitiff wretch
hate to god and to hi enemi
these miscreant who never were aliv
were nake and were stung exceedingli
by gadfli and by hornet that were there
these did their face irrig with blood
which with their tear commingl at their feet
by the disgust worm wa gather up
and when to gaze farther i betook me
peopl i saw on a great river bank
whenc said i master now vouchsaf to me
that i mai know who these ar and what law
make them appear so readi to pass over
as i discern athwart the duski light
and he to me these thing shall all be known
to thee as soon as we our footstep stai
upon the dismal shore of acheron
then with mine ey asham and downward cast
fear my word might irksom be to him
from speech refrain i till we reach the river
and lo toward us come in a boat
an old man hoari with the hair of eld
cry woe unto you ye soul deprav
hope nevermor to look upon the heaven
i come to lead you to the other shore
to the etern shade in heat and frost
and thou that yonder standest live soul
withdraw thee from these peopl who ar dead
but when he saw that i did not withdraw
he said by other wai by other port
thou to the shore shalt come not here for passag
a lighter vessel need must carri thee
and unto him the guid vex thee not charon
it is so will there where is power to do
that which is will and farther question not
thereat were quiet the fleeci cheek
of him the ferryman of the livid fen
who round about hi ey had wheel of flame
but all those soul who weari were and nake
their colour chang and gnash their teeth togeth
as soon as thei had heard those cruel word
god thei blasphem and their progenitor
the human race the place the time the seed
of their engend and of their birth
thereaft all togeth thei drew back
bitterli weep to the accurs shore
which waiteth everi man who fear not god
charon the demon with the ey of glede
beckon to them collect them all togeth
beat with hi oar whoever lag behind
as in the autumntim the leav fall off
first on and then anoth till the branch
unto the earth surrend all it spoil
in similar wise the evil seed of adam
throw themselv from that margin on by on
at signal as a bird unto it lure
so thei depart across the duski wave
and er upon the other side thei land
again on thi side a new troop assembl
my son the courteou master said to me
all those who perish in the wrath of god
here meet togeth out of everi land
and readi ar thei to pass oer the river
becaus celesti justic spur them on
so that their fear is turn into desir
thi wai there never pass a good soul
and henc if charon doth complain of thee
well mayst thou know now what hi speech import
thi be finish all the dusk champaign
trembl so violent that of that terror
the recollect bath me still with sweat
the land of tear gave forth a blast of wind
and fulmin a vermilion light
which overmast in me everi sens
and as a man whom sleep hath seiz i fell
inferno canto iv
broke the deep lethargi within my head
a heavi thunder so that i upstart
like to a person who by forc is waken
and round about i move my rest ey
uprisen erect and steadfastli i gaze
to recognis the place wherein i wa
true is it that upon the verg i found me
of the abysm vallei dolor
that gather thunder of infinit ulul
obscur profound it wa and nebul
so that by fix on it depth my sight
noth whatev i discern therein
let us descend now into the blind world
began the poet pallid utterli
i will be first and thou shalt second be
and i who of hi colour wa awar
said how shall i come if thou art afraid
whort wont to be a comfort to my fear
and he to me the anguish of the peopl
who ar below here in my face depict
that piti which for terror thou hast taken
let us go on for the long wai impel us
thu he went in and thu he made me enter
the foremost circl that surround the abyss
there as it seem to me from listen
were lament none but onli sigh
that trembl made the everlast air
and thi aros from sorrow without torment
which the crowd had that mani were and great
of infant and of women and of men
to me the master good thou dost not ask
what spirit these which thou beholdest ar
now will i have thee know er thou go farther
that thei sin not and if thei merit had
ti not enough becaus thei had not baptism
which is the portal of the faith thou holdest
and if thei were befor christian
in the right manner thei ador not god
and among such as these am i myself
for such defect and not for other guilt
lost ar we and ar onli so far punish
that without hope we live on in desir
great grief seiz on my heart when thi i heard
becaus some peopl of much worthi
i knew who in that limbo were suspend
tell me my master tell me thou my lord
began i with desir of be certain
of that faith which oercometh everi error
came ani on by hi own merit henc
or by anoth who wa bless thereaft
and he who understood my covert speech
repli i wa a novic in thi state
when i saw hither come a mighti on
with sign of victori incoron
henc he drew forth the shade of the first parent
and that of hi son abel and of noah
of mose the lawgiv and the obedi
abraham patriarch and david king
israel with hi father and hi children
and rachel for whose sake he did so much
and other mani and he made them bless
and thou must know that earlier than these
never were ani human spirit save
we ceas not to advanc becaus he spake
but still were pass onward through the forest
the forest sai i of thickcrowd ghost
not veri far as yet our wai had gone
thi side the summit when i saw a fire
that overcam a hemispher of dark
we were a littl distant from it still
but not so far that i in part discern not
that honour peopl held that place
o thou who honourest everi art and scienc
who mai these be which such great honour have
that from the fashion of the rest it part them
and he to me the honour name
that sound of them abov there in thy life
win grace in heaven that so advanc them
in the mean time a voic wa heard by me
all honour be to the preemin poet
hi shade return again that wa depart
after the voic had ceas and quiet wa
four mighti shade i saw approach us
semblanc had thei nor sorrow nor glad
to sai to me began my graciou master
him with that falchion in hi hand behold
who come befor the three even as their lord
that on is homer poet sovereign
he who come next is horac the satirist
the third is ovid and the last is lucan
becaus to each of these with me appli
the name that solitari voic proclaim
thei do me honour and in that do well
thu i beheld assembl the fair school
of that lord of the song preemin
who oer the other like an eagl soar
when thei togeth had discours somewhat
thei turn to me with sign of salut
and on behold thi my master smile
and more of honour still much more thei did me
in that thei made me on of their own band
so that the sixth wa i mid so much wit
thu we went on as far as to the light
thing sai ti becom to keep silent
as wa the sai of them where i wa
we came unto a nobl castl foot
seven time encompass with lofti wall
defend round by a fair rivulet
thi we pass over even as firm ground
through portal seven i enter with these sage
we came into a meadow of fresh verdur
peopl were there with solemn ey and slow
of great author in their counten
thei spake but seldom and with gentl voic
thu we withdrew ourselv upon on side
into an open lumin and lofti
so that thei all of them were visibl
there opposit upon the green enamel
were point out to me the mighti spirit
whom to have seen i feel myself exalt
i saw electra with companion mani
mongst whom i knew both hector and aenea
caesar in armour with gerfalcon ey
i saw camilla and penthesilea
on the other side and saw the king latinu
who with lavinia hi daughter sat
i saw that brutu who drove tarquin forth
lucretia julia marcia and cornelia
and saw alon apart the saladin
when i had lift up my brow a littl
the master i beheld of those who know

all gaze upon him and all do him honour
there i beheld both socrat and plato

democritu who put the world on chanc
diogen anaxagora and thale
zeno empedocl and heraclitu
of qualiti i saw the good collector

euclid geometrician and ptolemi

averro who the great comment made
i cannot all of them pourtrai in full
becaus so drive me onward the long theme
that mani time the word come short of fact
the sixfold compani in two divid
anoth wai my sapient guid conduct me
forth from the quiet to the air that trembl
and to a place i come where noth shine
inferno canto v
thu i descend out of the first circl
down to the second that less space begird
and so much greater dole that goad to wail
there standeth mino horribl and snarl
examin the transgress at the entranc

i sai that when the spirit evilborn
cometh befor him wholli it confess
and thi discrimin of transgress
seeth what place in hell is meet for it
gird himself with hi tail as mani time
as grade he wish it should be thrust down
alwai befor him mani of them stand
thei go by turn each on unto the judgment
thei speak and hear and then ar downward hurl
o thou that to thi dolor hostelri
comest said mino to me when he saw me
leav the practic of so great an offic
look how thou enterest and in whom thou trustest
let not the portal amplitud deceiv thee
and unto him my guid why criest thou too
do not imped hi journei fateordain
it is so will there where is power to do
that which is will and ask no further question
and now begin the dolesom note to grow
audibl unto me now am i come
there where much lament strike upon me
i came into a place mute of all light
which bellow as the sea doe in a tempest
if by oppos wind t is combat
the infern hurrican that never rest
hurtl the spirit onward in it rapin
whirl them round and smite it molest them
when thei arriv befor the precipic
there ar the shriek the plaint and the lament
there thei blasphem the puissanc divin
i understood that unto such a torment
the carnal malefactor were condemn
who reason subjug to appetit
and as the wing of starl bear them on
in the cold season in larg band and full
so doth that blast the spirit maledict
it hither thither downward upward drive them
no hope doth comfort them for evermor
not of repos but even of lesser pain
and as the crane go chant forth their lai
make in air a long line of themselv
so saw i come utter lament
shadow born onward by the aforesaid stress
whereupon said i master who ar those
peopl whom the black air so castig
the first of those of whom intellig
thou fain wouldst have then said he unto me
the empress wa of mani languag
to sensual vice she wa so abandon
that lust she made licit in her law
to remov the blame to which she had been led
she is semirami of whom we read
that she succeed ninu and wa hi spous
she held the land which now the sultan rule
the next is she who kill herself for love
and broke faith with the ash of sichaeu
then cleopatra the voluptu
helen i saw for whom so mani ruthless
season revolv and saw the great achil
who at the last hour combat with love
pari i saw tristan and more than a thousand
shade did he name and point out with hi finger
whom love had separ from our life
after that i had listen to my teacher
name the dame of eld and cavali
piti prevail and i wa nigh bewild
and i began o poet willingli
speak would i to those two who go togeth
and seem upon the wind to be so light
and he to me thoult mark when thei shall be
nearer to us and then do thou implor them
by love which leadeth them and thei will come
soon as the wind in our direct swai them
my voic uplift i o ye weari soul
come speak to us if no on interdict it
as turtledov call onward by desir
with open and steadi wing to the sweet nest
fly through the air by their volit born
so came thei from the band where dido is
approach us athwart the air malign
so strong wa the affection appeal
o live creatur graciou and benign
who visit goest through the purpl air
us who have stain the world incarnadin
if were the king of the univers our friend
we would prai unto him to give thee peac
sinc thou hast piti on our woe pervers
of what it pleas thee to hear and speak
that will we hear and we will speak to you
while silent is the wind as it is now
sitteth the citi wherein i wa born
upon the seashor where the po descend
to rest in peac with all hi retinu
love that on gentl heart doth swiftli seiz
seiz thi man for the person beauti
that wa taen from me and still the mode offend me
love that exempt no on belov from love
seiz me with pleasur of thi man so strongli
that as thou seest it doth not yet desert me
love ha conduct us unto on death
caina waiteth him who quench our life
these word were born along from them to us
as soon as i had heard those soul torment
i bow my face and so long held it down
until the poet said to me what thinkest
when i made answer i began ala
how mani pleasant thought how much desir
conduct these unto the dolor pass
then unto them i turn me and i spake
and i began thine agoni francesca
sad and compassion to weep make me
but tell me at the time of those sweet sigh
by what and in what manner love conced
that you should know your dubiou desir
and she to me there is no greater sorrow
than to be mind of the happi time
in miseri and that thy teacher know
but if to recognis the earliest root
of love in us thou hast so great desir
i will do even as he who weep and speak
on dai we read were for our delight
of launcelot how love did him enthral
alon we were and without ani fear
full mani a time our ey togeth drew
that read and drove the colour from our face
but on point onli wa it that oercam us
when as we read of the muchlongedfor smile
be by such a nobl lover kiss
thi on who neer from me shall be divid
kiss me upon the mouth all palpit
galeotto wa the book and he who wrote it
that dai no farther did we read therein
and all the while on spirit utter thi
the other on did weep so that for piti
i swoon awai as if i had been dy
and fell even as a dead bodi fall

at the return of conscious that close
befor the piti of those two relat
which utterli with sad had confus me

oft turn themselv the wretch reprob
when cerberu perceiv us the great worm
hi mouth he open and displai hi tusk
not a limb had he that wa motionless
and my conductor with hi span extend

he threw it into those rapaci gullet
such as that dog is who by bark crave

for to devour it he but think and struggl
the like becam those muzzl filthbegrim
of cerberu the demon who so thunder
over the soul that thei would fain be deaf
we pass across the shadow which subdu
the heavi rainstorm and we place our feet
upon their vaniti that person seem
thei all were ly prone upon the earth
except on who sat upright as soon
as he beheld us pass on befor him
o thou that art conduct through thi hell
he said to me recal me if thou canst

and i to him the anguish which thou hast
perhap doth draw thee out of my remembr
so that it seem not i have ever seen thee
but tell me who thou art that in so dole
a place art put and in such punish
if some ar greater none is so displeas
and he to me thy citi which is full

you citizen were wont to call me ciacco
for the pernici sin of gluttoni
i as thou seest am batter by thi rain

but tell me if thou knowest to what shall come
the citizen of the divid citi
if ani there be just and the occas
tell me why so much discord ha assail it
and he to me thei after long content
will come to bloodsh and the rustic parti
will drive the other out with much offenc
then afterward behov it thi on fall

keep the other under heavi burden
howeer it weep thereat and is indign

and he thei ar among the blacker soul

if thou so far descendest thou canst see them

i prai thee to the mind of other bring me
no more i tell thee and no more i answer
then hi straightforward ey he turn askanc

wherefor i said master these torment here
will thei increas after the mighti sentenc
or lesser be or will thei be as burn
and he to me return unto thy scienc
which will that as the thing more perfect is
the more it feel of pleasur and of pain
albeit that thi peopl maledict
to true perfect never can attain
hereaft more than now thei look to be
round in a circl by that road we went
speak much more which i do not repeat
we came unto the point where the descent is
there we found plutu the great enemi
inferno canto vii

thu plutu with hi cluck voic began
and that benign sage who all thing knew
said to encourag me let not thy fear
harm thee for ani power that he mai have
shall not prevent thy go down thi crag
then he turn round unto that bloat lip
and said be silent thou accurs wolf
consum within thyself with thine own rage
not causeless is thi journei to the abyss
thu is it will on high where michael wrought
vengeanc upon the proud adulteri
even as the sail inflat by the wind
involv togeth fall when snap the mast
so fell the cruel monster to the earth
thu we descend into the fourth chasm
gain still farther on the dolesom shore
which all the woe of the univers insack
justic of god ah who heap up so mani
new toil and suffer as i beheld
and why doth our transgress wast us so
as doth the billow there upon charybdi
that break itself on that which it encount
so here the folk must danc their roundelai
here saw i peopl more than elsewher mani
on on side and the other with great howl
roll weight forward by main forc of chest
thei clash togeth and then at that point
each on turn backward roll retrograd
cry why keepest and why squanderest thou
thu thei return along the lurid circl
on either hand unto the opposit point
shout their shame metr evermor
then each when he arriv there wheel about
through hi halfcircl to anoth joust
and i who had my heart pierc as it were
exclaim my master now declar to me
what peopl these ar and if all were clerk
these shaven crown upon the left of us
and he to me all of them were asquint
in intellect in the first life so much
that there with measur thei no spend made
clearli enough their voic bark it forth
wheneer thei reach the two point of the circl
where sunder them the opposit defect
clerk those were who no hairi cover
have on the head and pope and cardin
in whom doth avaric practis it excess
and i my master among such as these
i ought forsooth to recognis some few
who were infect with these maladi
and he to me vain thought thou entertainest
the undiscern life which made them sordid
now make them unto all discern dim
forev shall thei come to these two but
these from the sepulchr shall rise again
with the fist close and these with tress shorn
ill give and ill keep the fair world
have taen from them and place them in thi scuffl
whateer it be no word adorn i for it
now canst thou son behold the transient farc
of good that ar commit unto fortun
for which the human race each other buffet
for all the gold that is beneath the moon
or ever ha been of these weari soul
could never make a singl on repos
master i said to him now tell me also
what is thi fortun which thou speakest of
that ha the world good so within it clutch
and he to me o creatur imbecil
what ignor is thi which doth beset you
now will i have thee learn my judgment of her
he whose omnisci everyth transcend
the heaven creat and gave who should guid them
that everi part to everi part mai shine
distribut the light in equal measur
he in like manner to the mundan splendour
ordain a gener ministress and guid
that she might chang at time the empti treasur
from race to race from on blood to anoth
beyond resist of all human wisdom
therefor on peopl triumph and anoth
languish in pursuanc of her judgment
which hidden is as in the grass a serpent
your knowledg ha no counterstand against her
she make provis judg and pursu
her govern as their the other god
her permut have not ani truce
necess make her precipit
so often cometh who hi turn obtain
and thi is she who is so crucifi
even by those who ought to give her prais
give her blame amiss and bad reput
but she is bliss and she hear it not
among the other primal creatur gladsom
she turn her sphere and bliss she rejoic
let us descend now unto greater woe
alreadi sink each star that wa ascend
when i set out and loiter is forbidden
we cross the circl to the other bank
near to a fount that boil and pour itself
along a gulli that run out of it
the water wa more sombr far than pers
and we in compani with the duski wave
made entranc downward by a path uncouth
a marsh it make which ha the name of styx
thi trist brooklet when it ha descend
down to the foot of the malign grai shore
and i who stood intent upon behold
saw peopl mudbespr in that lagoon
all of them nake and with angri look
thei smote each other not alon with hand
but with the head and with the breast and feet
tear each other piecem with their teeth
said the good master son thou now beholdest
the soul of those whom anger overcam
and likewis i would have thee know for certain
beneath the water peopl ar who sigh
and make thi water bubbl at the surfac
as the ey tell thee whereso it turn
fix in the mire thei sai we sullen were
in the sweet air which by the sun is gladden
bear within ourselv the sluggish reek
now we ar sullen in thi sabl mire
thi hymn do thei keep gurgl in their throat
for with unbroken word thei cannot sai it
thu we went circl round the filthi fen
a great arc twixt the dry bank and the swamp
with ey turn unto those who gorg the mire
unto the foot of a tower we came at last
inferno canto viii
i sai continu that long befor
we to the foot of that high tower had come
our ey went upward to the summit of it
by reason of two flamelet we saw place there
and from afar anoth answer them
so far that hardli could the ey attain it
and to the sea of all discern turn
i said what sayeth thi and what respondeth
that other fire and who ar thei that made it
and he to me across the turbid wave
what is expect thou canst now discern
if reek of the morass conceal it not
cord never shot an arrow from itself
that sped awai athwart the air so swift
as i beheld a veri littl boat
come oer the water towrd us at that moment
under the guidanc of a singl pilot
who shout now art thou arriv fell soul
phlegya phlegya thou criest out in vain
for thi onc said my lord thou shalt not have us
longer than in the pass of the slough
as he who listen to some great deceit
that ha been done to him and then resent it
such becam phlegya in hi gather wrath
my guid descend down into the boat
and then he made me enter after him
and onli when i enter seem it laden
soon as the guid and i were in the boat
the antiqu prow goe on it wai divid
more of the water than ti wont with other
while we were run through the dead canal
upros in front of me on full of mire
and said who rt thou that comest er the hour
and i to him although i come i stai not
but who art thou that hast becom so squalid
thou seest that i am on who weep he answer
and i to him with weep and with wail
thou spirit maledict do thou remain
for thee i know though thou art all defil
then stretch he both hi hand unto the boat
whereat my wari master thrust him back
sai awai there with the other dog
thereaft with hi arm he clasp my neck
he kiss my face and said disdain soul
bless be she who bore thee in her bosom
that wa an arrog person in the world
good is none that deck hi memori
so likewis here hi shade is furiou
how mani ar esteem great king up there
who here shall be like unto swine in mire
leav behind them horribl disprais
and i my master much should i be pleas
if i could see him sous into thi broth
befor we issu forth out of the lake
and he to me er unto thee the shore
reveal itself thou shalt be satisfi
such a desir ti meet thou shouldst enjoi
a littl after that i saw such havoc
made of him by the peopl of the mire
that still i prais and thank my god for it
thei all were shout at philippo argenti
and that exasper spirit florentin
turn round upon himself with hi own teeth
we left him there and more of him i tell not
but on mine ear there smote a lament
whenc forward i intent unbar mine ey
and the good master said even now my son
the citi draweth near whose name is di
with the grave citizen with the great throng
and i it mosqu alreadi master clearli
within there in the vallei i discern
vermilion as if issu from the fire
thei were and he to me the fire etern
that kindl them within make them look red
as thou beholdest in thi nether hell
then we arriv within the moat profound
that circumval that disconsol citi
the wall appear to me to be of iron
not without make first a circuit wide
we came unto a place where loud the pilot
cri out to us debark here is the entranc
more than a thousand at the gate i saw
out of the heaven rain down who angrili
were sai who is thi that without death
goe through the kingdom of the peopl dead
and my sagaci master made a sign
of wish secretli to speak with them
a littl then thei quell their great disdain
and said come thou alon and he begon
who ha so boldli enter these dominion
let him return alon by hi mad road
try if he can for thou shalt here remain
who hast escort him through such dark region
think reader if i wa discomfort
at utter of the accurs word
for never to return here i believ
o my dear guid who more than seven time
hast render me secur and drawn me
from immin peril that befor me stood
do not desert me said i thu undon
and if the go farther be deni us
let us retrac our step togeth swiftli
and that lord who had led me thitherward
said unto me fear not becaus our passag
none can take from us it by such is given
but here await me and thy weari spirit
comfort and nourish with a better hope
for in thi nether world i will not leav thee
so onward goe and there abandon me
my father sweet and i remain in doubt
for no and ye within my head contend
i could not hear what he propos to them
but with them there he did not linger long
er each within in rivalri ran back
thei close the portal those our adversari
on my lord breast who had remain without
and turn to me with footstep far between
hi ey cast down hi forehead shorn had he
of all it bold and he said with sigh
who ha deni to me the dolesom hous
and unto me thou becaus i am angri
fear not for i will conquer in the trial
whatev for defenc within be plan
thi arrog of their is noth new
for onc thei us it at less secret gate
which find itself without a fasten still
oer it didst thou behold the dead inscript
and now thi side of it descend the steep
pass across the circl without escort
on by whose mean the citi shall be open
inferno canto ix
that hue which cowardic brought out on me
behold my conductor backward turn
sooner repress within him hi new colour
he stop attent like a man who listen
becaus the ey could not conduct him far
through the black air and through the heavi fog
still it behoveth us to win the fight
began he els such offer us herself
o how i long that some on here arriv
well i perceiv as soon as the begin
he cover up with what came afterward
that thei were word quit differ from the first
but none the less hi sai gave me fear
becaus i carri out the broken phrase
perhap to a wors mean than he had
into thi bottom of the dole conch
doth ani eer descend from the first grade
which for it pain ha onli hope cut off
thi question put i and he answer me
seldom it come to pass that on of us
maketh the journei upon which i go
true is it onc befor i here below
wa conjur by that pitiless erictho
who summon back the shade unto their bodi
nake of me short while the flesh had been
befor within that wall she made me enter
to bring a spirit from the circl of juda
that is the lowest region and the darkest
and farthest from the heaven which circl all
well know i the wai therefor be reassur
thi fen which a prodigi stench exhal
encompass about the citi dolent
where now we cannot enter without anger
and more he said but not in mind i have it
becaus mine ey had altogeth drawn me
towrd the high tower with the redflam summit
where in a moment saw i swift uprisen
the three infern furi stain with blood
who had the limb of women and their mien
and with the greenest hydra were begirt
small serpent and cerast were their tress
wherewith their horrid templ were entwin
and he who well the handmaid of the queen
of everlast lament knew
said unto me behold the fierc erinni
thi is megaera on the lefthand side
she who is weep on the right alecto
tisiphon is between and then wa silent
each on her breast wa rend with her nail
thei beat them with their palm and cri so loud
that i for dread press close unto the poet
medusa come so we to stone will chang him
all shout look down in evil hour
aveng we not on theseu hi assault
turn thyself round and keep thine ey close shut
for if the gorgon appear and thou shouldst see it
no more return upward would there be
thu said the master and he turn me round
himself and trust not unto my hand
so far as not to blind me with hi own
o ye who have undistemp intellect
observ the doctrin that conceal itself
beneath the veil of the mysteri vers
and now there came across the turbid wave
the clangour of a sound with terror fraught
becaus of which both of the margin trembl
not otherwis it wa than of a wind
impetu on account of advers heat
that smite the forest and without restraint
the branch rend beat down and bear awai
right onward laden with dust it goe superb
and put to flight the wild beast and the shepherd
mine ey he loos and said direct the nerv
of vision now along that ancient foam
there yonder where that smoke is most intens
even as the frog befor the hostil serpent
across the water scatter all abroad
until each on is huddl in the earth
more than a thousand ruin soul i saw
thu flee from befor on who on foot
wa pass oer the styx with sole unwet
from off hi face he fan that unctuou air
wave hi left hand oft in front of him
and onli with that anguish seem he weari
well i perceiv on sent from heaven wa he
and to the master turn and he made sign
that i should quiet stand and bow befor him
ah how disdain he appear to me
he reach the gate and with a littl rod
he open it for there wa no resist
o banish out of heaven peopl despis
thu he began upon the horrid threshold
whenc is thi arrog within you couch
wherefor recalcitr against that will
from which the end can never be cut off
and which ha mani time increas your pain
what helpeth it to butt against the fate
your cerberu if you rememb well
for that still bear hi chin and gullet peel
then he return along the miri road
and spake no word to us but had the look
of on whom other care constrain and goad
than that of him who in hi presenc is
and we our feet direct towrd the citi
after those holi word all confid
within we enter without ani contest
and i who inclin had to see
what the condit such a fortress hold
soon as i wa within cast round mine ey
and see on everi hand an ampl plain
full of distress and torment terribl
even as at arl where stagnant grow the rhone
even as at pola near to the quarnaro
that shut in itali and bath it border
the sepulchr make all the place uneven
so likewis did thei there on everi side
save that there the manner wa more bitter
for flame between the sepulchr were scatter
by which thei so intens heat were
that iron more so ask not ani art
all of their cover uplift were
and from them issu forth such dire lament
sooth seem thei of the wretch and torment
and i my master what ar all those peopl
who have sepultur within those tomb
make themselv audibl by dole sigh
and he to me here ar the heresiarch
with their discipl of all sect and much
more than thou thinkest laden ar the tomb
here like togeth with it like is buri
and more and less the monument ar heat
and when he to the right had turn we pass
between the torment and high parapet
inferno canto x
now onward goe along a narrow path
between the torment and the citi wall
my master and i follow at hi back
o power suprem that through these impiou circl
turnest me i began as pleas thee

when from jehoshaphat thei shall return

their cemeteri have upon thi side
with epicuru all hi follow
who with the bodi mortal make the soul
but in the question thou dost put to me
within here shalt thou soon be satisfi
and likewis in the wish thou keepest silent
and i good leader i but keep conceal
from thee my heart that i mai speak the less

o tuscan thou who through the citi of fire

be pleas to stai thy footstep in thi place
thy mode of speak make thee manifest
a nativ of that nobl fatherland
to which perhap i too molest wa
upon a sudden issu forth thi sound

and unto me he said turn thee what dost thou
behold there farinata who ha risen
from the waist upward wholli shalt thou see him
i had alreadi fix mine ey on hi
and he upros erect with breast and front
een as if hell he had in great despit
and with courag hand and prompt my leader
thrust me between the sepulchr toward him
exclaim let thy word explicit be
as soon as i wa at the foot of hi tomb
somewhat he ei me and as if disdain
then ask of me who were thine ancestor
i who desir of obei wa

whereat he rais hi brow a littl upward
then said he fierc advers have thei been
to me and to my father and my parti
so that two sever time i scatter them
if thei were banish thei return on all side
i answer him the first time and the second
but your have not acquir that art aright
then there upros upon the sight uncov
down to the chin a shadow at hi side
i think that he had risen on hi knee
round me he gaze as if solicitud
he had to see if some on els were with me
but after hi suspicion wa all spent
weep he said to me if through thi blind
prison thou goest by lofti of geniu
where is my son and why is he not with thee
and i to him i come not of myself
he who is wait yonder lead me here

neither hi neck he move nor bent hi side

that more tormenteth me than doth thi bed
but fifti time shall not rekindl be
the counten of the ladi who reign here

and as thou wouldst to the sweet world return
sai why that peopl is so pitiless
against my race in each on of it law
whenc i to him the slaughter and great carnag
which have with crimson stain the arbia caus
such orison in our templ to be made
after hi head he with a sigh had shaken

without a caus had with the other move
but there i wa alon where everi on
consent to the lai wast of florenc
he who defend her with open face
ah so hereaft mai your seed repos
i him entreat solv for me that knot
which ha entangl my concept here
it seem that you can see if i hear rightli
beforehand whatsoeer time bring with it
and in the present have anoth mode
we see like those who have imperfect sight
the thing he said that distant ar from us
so much still shine on us the sovereign ruler
when thei draw near or ar is wholli vain
our intellect and if none bring it to us
not anyth know we of your human state
henc thou canst understand that wholli dead
will be our knowledg from the moment when
the portal of the futur shall be close
then i as if compuncti for my fault
said now then you will tell that fallen on
that still hi son is with the live join
and if just now in answer i wa dumb
tell him i did it becaus i wa think
alreadi of the error you have solv me
and now my master wa recal me
wherefor more eagerli i prai the spirit
that he would tell me who wa with him there
he said with more than a thousand here i lie
within here is the second frederick
and the cardin and of the rest i speak not
thereon he hid himself and i toward
the ancient poet turn my step reflect
upon that sai which seem hostil to me
he move along and afterward thu go
he said to me why art thou so bewild
and i in hi inquiri satisfi him
let memori preserv what thou hast heard
against thyself that sage command me
and now attend here and he rais hi finger
when thou shalt be befor the radianc sweet
of her whose beauteou ey all thing behold
from her thoult know the journei of thy life
unto the left hand then he turn hi feet
we left the wall and went toward the middl
along a path that strike into a vallei
which even up there unpleas made it stench
inferno canto xi
upon the margin of a lofti bank
which great rock broken in a circl made
we came upon a still more cruel throng
and there by reason of the horribl
excess of stench the deep abyss throw out
we drew ourselv asid behind the cover
of a great tomb whereon i saw a write
which said pope anastasiu i hold
whom out of the right wai photinu drew
slow it behoveth our descent to be
so that the sens be first a littl us
to the sad blast and then we shall not heed it
the master thu and unto him i said
some compens find that the time pass not
idli and he thou seest i think of that
my son upon the insid of these rock
began he then to sai ar three small circl
from grade to grade like those which thou art leav
thei all ar full of spirit maledict
but that hereaft sight alon suffic thee
hear how and wherefor thei ar in constraint
of everi malic that win hate in heaven
injuri is the end and all such end
either by forc or fraud afflicteth other
but becaus fraud is man peculiar vice
more it displeas god and so stand lowest
the fraudul and greater dole assail them
all the first circl of the violent is
but sinc forc mai be us against three person
in three round ti divid and construct
to god to ourselv and to our neighbour can we
us forc i sai on them and on their thing
as thou shalt hear with reason manifest
a death by violenc and pain wound
ar to our neighbour given and in hi substanc
ruin and arson and injuri levi
whenc homicid and he who smite unjustli
maraud and freeboot the first round
tormenteth all in compani divers
man mai lai violent hand upon himself
and hi own good and therefor in the second
round must perforc without avail repent
whoever of your world depriv himself
who game and dissip hi properti
and weepeth there where he should jocund be
violenc can be done the deiti
in heart deni and blasphem him
and by disdain natur and her bounti
and for thi reason doth the smallest round
seal with it signet sodom and cahor
and who disdain god speak from the heart
fraud wherewith is everi conscienc stung
a man mai practis upon him who trust
and him who doth no confid imburs
thi latter mode it would appear dissev
onli the bond of love which natur make
wherefor within the second circl nestl
hypocrisi flatteri and who deal in magic
falsif theft and simoni
pander and barrat and the like filth
by the other mode forgotten is that love
which natur make and what is after ad
from which there is a special faith engend
henc in the smallest circl where the point is
of the univers upon which di is seat
whoeer betrai for ever is consum
and i my master clear enough proce
thy reason and full well distinguish
thi cavern and the peopl who possess it
but tell me those within the fat lagoon
whom the wind drive and whom the rain doth beat
and who encount with such bitter tongu
wherefor ar thei insid of the red citi
not punish if god ha them in hi wrath
and if he ha not wherefor in such fashion
and unto me he said why wander so
thine intellect from that which it is wont
or sooth thy mind where is it elsewher look
hast thou no recollect of those word
with which thine ethic thoroughli discuss
the disposit three that heaven abid not
incontin and malic and insan
bestial and how incontin
less god offendeth and less blame attract
if thou regardest thi conclus well
and to thy mind recallest who thei ar
that up outsid ar undergo penanc
clearli wilt thou perceiv why from these felon
thei separ ar and why less wroth
justic divin doth smite them with it hammer
o sun that healest all distemp vision
thou dost content me so when thou resolvest
that doubt pleas me no less than know
onc more a littl backward turn thee said i
there where thou sayest that usuri offend
good divin and disengag the knot
philosophi he said to him who heed it
noteth not onli in on place alon
after what manner natur take her cours
from intellect divin and from it art
and if thy physic carefulli thou notest
after not mani page shalt thou find
that thi your art as far as possibl
follow as the discipl doth the master
so that your art is as it were god grandchild
from these two if thou bringest to thy mind
genesi at the begin it behov
mankind to gain their life and to advanc
and sinc the usur take anoth wai

disdain he for elsewher he put hi hope
but follow now as i would fain go on
for quiver ar the fish on the horizon
and the wain wholli over cauru li

inferno canto xii
the place where to descend the bank we came
wa alpin and from what wa there moreov
of such a kind that everi ey would shun it
such as that ruin is which in the flank
smote on thi side of trent the adig

for from the mountain top from which it move
unto the plain the cliff is shatter so
some path twould give to him who wa abov
even such wa the descent of that ravin
and on the border of the broken chasm
the infami of crete wa stretch along
who wa conceiv in the fictiti cow
and when he us beheld he bit himself
even as on whom anger rack within
my sage toward him shout peradventur
thou thinkst that here mai be the duke of athen
who in the world abov brought death to thee
get thee gone beast for thi on cometh not

in order to behold your punish
as is that bull who break loos at the moment
in which he ha receiv the mortal blow
who cannot walk but stagger here and there
the minotaur beheld i do the like
and he the wari cri run to the passag
while he wroth ti well thou shouldst descend
thu down we took our wai oer that discharg

beneath my feet from the unwont burden
thought i went and he said thou art think
perhap upon thi ruin which is guard
by that brute anger which just now i quench
now will i have thee know the other time
i here descend to the nether hell
thi precipic had not yet fallen down
but truli if i well discern a littl
befor hi come who the mighti spoil
bore off from di in the supern circl
upon all side the deep and loathsom vallei
trembl so that i thought the univers
wa thrill with love by which there ar who think
the world ofttim convert into chao
and at that moment thi primev crag
both here and elsewher made such overthrow
but fix thine ey below for draweth near
the river of blood within which boil is
whoeer by violenc doth injur other
o blind cupid o wrath insan
that spur us onward so in our short life
and in the etern then so badli steep us
i saw an ampl moat bent like a bow
as on which all the plain encompass
conform to what my guid had said
and between thi and the embank foot
centaur in file were run arm with arrow
as in the world thei us the chase to follow
behold us descend each on stood still
and from the squadron three detach themselv
with bow and arrow in advanc select
and from afar on cri unto what torment
come ye who down the hillsid ar descend
tell us from there if not i draw the bow
my master said our answer will we make
to chiron near you there in evil hour
that will of thine wa evermor so hasti
then touch he me and said thi on is nessu
who perish for the love dejanira
and for himself himself did vengeanc take
and he in the midst who at hi breast is gaze
is the great chiron who brought up achil
that other pholu is who wa so wrath
thousand and thousand go about the moat
shoot with shaft whatev soul emerg
out of the blood more than hi crime allot
near we approach unto those monster fleet
chiron an arrow took and with the notch
backward upon hi jaw he put hi beard
after he had uncov hi great mouth
he said to hi companion ar you ware

and my good guid who now wa at hi breast

necess and not delight impel us
some on withdrew from sing halleluja
who unto me commit thi new offic
no thief is he nor i a thievish spirit
but by that virtu through which i am move
my step along thi savag thoroughfar
give us some on of thine to be with us
and who mai show us where to pass the ford
and who mai carri thi on on hi back
for ti no spirit that can walk the air
upon hi right breast chiron wheel about
and said to nessu turn and do thou guid them
and warn asid if other band mai meet you
we with our faith escort onward move
along the brink of the vermilion boil
wherein the boil were utter loud lament
peopl i saw within up to the eyebrow
and the great centaur said tyrant ar these
who dealt in bloodsh and in pillag
here thei lament their pitiless mischief here
is alexand and fierc dionysiu
who upon sicili brought dolor year
that forehead there which ha the hair so black
is azzolin and the other who is blond
obizzo is of esti who in truth
up in the world wa by hi stepson slain
then turn i to the poet and he said
now he be first to thee and second i
a littl farther on the centaur stop
abov a folk who far down as the throat
seem from that boil stream to issu forth
a shade he show us on on side alon
sai he cleft asund in god bosom
the heart that still upon the thame is honour
then peopl saw i who from out the river
lift their head and also all the chest
and mani among these i recognis
thu ever more and more grew shallow
that blood so that the feet alon it cover
and there across the moat our passag wa
even as thou here upon thi side beholdest
the boil stream that ay diminish
the centaur said i wish thee to believ
that on thi other more and more declin

where it behoveth tyranni to groan
justic divin upon thi side is goad
that attila who wa a scourg on earth
and pyrrhu and sextu and for ever milk

in rinier da corneto and rinier pazzo
who made upon the highwai so much war
then back he turn and pass again the ford
inferno canto xiii

such tangl thicket have not nor so dens

thei make lament upon the wondrou tree
and the good master er thou enter farther
know that thou art within the second round
thu he began to sai and shalt be till
thou comest out upon the horribl sand
therefor look well around and thou shalt see
thing that will credenc give unto my speech
i heard on all side lament utter
and person none beheld i who might make them
whenc utterli bewild i stood still
i think he thought that i perhap might think
so mani voic issu through those trunk

therefor the master said if thou break off
some littl sprai from ani of these tree
the thought thou hast will wholli be made vain
then stretch i forth my hand a littl forward
and pluck a branchlet off from a great thorn
and the trunk cri why dost thou mangl me
after it had becom embrown with blood
it recommenc it cry why dost thou rend me
hast thou no spirit of piti whatsoev
men onc we were and now ar chang to tree
inde thy hand should be more piti
even if the soul of serpent we had been
as out of a green brand that is on fire
at on of the end and from the other drip
and hiss with the wind that is escap
so from that splinter issu forth togeth
both word and blood whereat i let the tip
fall and stood like a man who is afraid
had he been abl sooner to believ
my sage made answer o thou wound soul
what onli in my vers he ha seen
not upon thee had he stretch forth hi hand
wherea the thing incred ha caus me
to put him to an act which grieveth me
but tell him who thou wast so that by wai

and thei inflam did so inflam augustu
that my glad honour turn to dismal mourn
my spirit in disdain exult

unto my lord who wa so worthi of honour
and to the world if on of you return
let him my memori comfort which is ly

the poet said to me lose not the time

therefor he recommenc so mai the man

he turn hi face toward me and now wait
he said to these we should be courteou
and if it were not for the fire that dart
the natur of thi region i should sai
that hast were more becom thee than them
as soon as we stood still thei recommenc
the old refrain and when thei overtook us
form of themselv a wheel all three of them
as champion strip and oil ar wont to do
watch for their advantag and their hold
befor thei come to blow and thrust between them
thu wheel round did everi on hi visag
direct to me so that in opposit wise
hi neck and feet continu journei made
and if the miseri of thi soft place
bring in disdain ourselv and our entreati
began on and our aspect black and blister
let the renown of us thy mind inclin
to tell us who thou art who thu secur
thy live feet dost move along through hell
he in whose footprint thou dost see me tread
nake and skinless though he now mai go
wa of a greater rank than thou dost think
he wa the grandson of the good gualdrada
hi name wa guidoguerra and in life
much did he with hi wisdom and hi sword
the other who close by me tread the sand
tegghiaio aldobrandi is whose fame
abov there in the world should welcom be
and i who with them on the cross am place
jacopo rusticucci wa and truli
my savag wife more than aught els doth harm me
could i have been protect from the fire
below i should have thrown myself among them
and think the teacher would have suffer it
but as i should have burn and bake myself
my terror overmast my good will
which made me greedi of embrac them
then i began sorrow and not disdain
did your condit fix within me so
that tardili it wholli is strip off
as soon as thi my lord said unto me
word on account of which i thought within me
that peopl such as you ar were approach
i of your citi am and evermor
your labour and your honour name
i with affect have retrac and heard
i leav the gall and go for the sweet fruit
promis to me by the veraci leader
but to the centr first i need must plung
so mai the soul for a long while conduct
those limb of thine did he make answer then
and so mai thy renown shine after thee
valour and courtesi sai if thei dwell
within our citi as thei us to do
or if thei wholli have gone out of it
for guglielmo borsier who is in torment
with us of late and goe there with hi comrad
doth greatli mortifi us with hi word
the new inhabit and the sudden gain
pride and extravag have in thee engend
florenc so that thou weepst thereat alreadi
in thi wise i exclaim with face uplift
and the three take that for my repli
look at each other as on look at truth
if other time so littl it doth cost thee
repli thei all to satisfi anoth
happi art thou thu speak at thy will
therefor if thou escap from these dark place
and come to rebehold the beauteou star
when it shall pleasur thee to sai i wa
see that thou speak of us unto the peopl
then thei broke up the wheel and in their flight
it seem as if their agil leg were wing
not an amen could possibl be said
so rapidli as thei had disappear
wherefor the master deem best to depart
i follow him and littl had we gone
befor the sound of water wa so near us
that speak we should hardli have been heard
even as that stream which holdeth it own cours
the first from mont veso towrd the east
upon the lefthand slope of apennin
which is abov call acquacheta er
it down descendeth into it low bed
and at forli is vacant of that name
reverber there abov san benedetto
from alp by fall at a singl leap
where for a thousand there were room enough
thu downward from a bank precipit
we found resound that darktint water
so that it soon the ear would have offend
i had a cord around about me girt
and therewith i whilom had design
to take the panther with the paint skin
after i thi had all from me unloos
as my conductor had command me
i reach it to him gather up and coil
whereat he turn himself to the right side
and at a littl distanc from the verg
he cast it down into that deep abyss
it must need be some novelti respond
i said within myself to the new signal
the master with hi ey is follow so
ah me how veri cautiou men should be
with those who not alon behold the act
but with their wisdom look into the thought
he said to me soon there will upward come
what i await and what thy thought is dream
must soon reveal itself unto thy sight
ay to that truth which ha the face of falsehood
a man should close hi lip as far as mai be
becaus without hi fault it caus shame
but here i cannot and reader by the note
of thi my comedi to thee i swear
so mai thei not be void of last favour
athwart that dens and darksom atmospher
i saw a figur swim upward come
marvel unto everi steadfast heart
even as he return who goeth down
sometim to clear an anchor which ha grappl
reef or aught els that in the sea is hidden
who upward stretch and draw in hi feet
inferno canto xvii
behold the monster with the point tail
who cleav the hill and breaketh wall and weapon
behold him who infecteth all the world
thu unto me my guid began to sai
and beckon him that he should come to shore
near to the confin of the trodden marbl
and that uncleanli imag of deceit
came up and thrust ashor it head and bust
but on the border did not drag it tail
the face wa as the face of a just man
it semblanc outwardli wa so benign
and of a serpent all the trunk besid
two paw it had hairi unto the armpit
the back and breast and both the side it had
depict oer with noos and with shield
with colour more groundwork or broideri
never in cloth did tartar make nor turk
nor were such tissu by arachn laid
as sometim wherri lie upon the shore
that part ar in the water part on land
and as among the guzzl german there
the beaver plant himself to wage hi war
so that vile monster lai upon the border
which is of stone and shutteth in the sand
hi tail wa wholli quiver in the void
contort upward the envenom fork
that in the guis of scorpion arm it point
the guid said now perforc must turn asid
our wai a littl even to that beast
malevol that yonder coucheth him
we therefor on the right side descend
and made ten step upon the outer verg
complet to avoid the sand and flame
and after we ar come to him i see
a littl farther off upon the sand
a peopl sit near the hollow place
then said to me the master so that full
experi of thi round thou bear awai
now go and see what their condit is
there let thy convers be concis
till thou returnest i will speak with him
that he conced to us hi stalwart shoulder
thu farther still upon the outermost
head of that seventh circl all alon
i went where sat the melancholi folk
out of their ey wa gush forth their woe
thi wai that wai thei help them with their hand
now from the flame and now from the hot soil
not otherwis in summer do the dog
now with the foot now with the muzzl when
by flea or fli or gadfli thei ar bitten
when i had turn mine ey upon the face
of some on whom the dolor fire is fall
not on of them i knew but i perceiv
that from the neck of each there hung a pouch
which certain colour had and certain blazon
and thereupon it seem their ey ar feed
and as i gaze round me come among them
upon a yellow pouch i azur saw
that had the face and postur of a lion
proceed then the current of my sight
anoth of them saw i red as blood
displai a goos more white than butter is
and on who with an azur sow and gravid
emblazon had hi littl pouch of white
said unto me what dost thou in thi moat
now get thee gone and sinc thourt still aliv
know that a neighbour of mine vitaliano
will have hi seat here on my lefthand side
a paduan am i with these florentin
full mani a time thei thunder in mine ear
exclaim come the sovereign cavali
he who shall bring the satchel with three goat
then twist he hi mouth and forth he thrust
hi tongu like to an ox that lick it nose
and fear lest my longer stai might vex
him who had warn me not to tarri long
backward i turn me from those weari soul
i found my guid who had alreadi mount
upon the back of that wild anim
and said to me now be both strong and bold
now we descend by stairwai such as these
mount thou in front for i will be midwai
so that the tail mai have no power to harm thee
such as he is who ha so near the agu
of quartan that hi nail ar blue alreadi
and trembl all but look at the shade
even such becam i at those proffer word
but shame in me hi menac produc
which maketh servant strong befor good master
i seat me upon those monstrou shoulder
i wish to sai and yet the voic came not
as i believ take heed that thou embrac me
but he who other time had rescu me
in other peril soon as i had mount
within hi arm encircl and sustain me
and said now geryon bestir thyself
the circl larg and the descent be littl
think of the novel burden which thou hast
even as the littl vessel shove from shore
backward still backward so he thenc withdrew
and when he wholli felt himself afloat
there where hi breast had been he turn hi tail
and that extend like an eel he move
and with hi paw drew to himself the air
a greater fear i do not think there wa
what time abandon phaeton the rein
wherebi the heaven as still appear were scorch
nor when the wretch icaru hi flank
felt strip of feather by the melt wax
hi father cry an ill wai thou takest
than wa my own when i perceiv myself
on all side in the air and saw extinguish
the sight of everyth but of the monster
onward he goeth swim slowli slowli
wheel and descend but i perceiv it onli
by wind upon my face and from below
i heard alreadi on the right the whirlpool
make a horribl crash under us
whenc i thrust out my head with ey cast downward
then wa i still more fear of the abyss
becaus i fire beheld and heard lament
whereat i trembl all the closer cling
i saw then for befor i had not seen it
the turn and descend by great horror
that were approach upon diver side
as falcon who ha long been on the wing
who without see either lure or bird
maketh the falcon sai ah me thou stoopest
descendeth weari whenc he start swiftli
thorough a hundr circl and alight
far from hi master sullen and disdain
even thu did geryon place us on the bottom
close to the base of the roughhewn rock
and be disencumb of our person
he sped awai as arrow from the string
inferno canto xviii
there is a place in hell call malebolg
wholli of stone and of an iron colour
as is the circl that around it turn
right in the middl of the field malign
there yawn a well exceed wide and deep
of which it place the structur will recount
round then is that enclosur which remain
between the well and foot of the high hard bank
and ha distinct in vallei ten it bottom
as where for the protect of the wall
mani and mani moat surround the castl
the part in which thei ar a figur form
just such an imag those present there
and as about such stronghold from their gate
unto the outer bank ar littl bridg
so from the precipic base did crag
project which intersect dike and moat
unto the well that truncat and collect them
within thi place down shaken from the back
of geryon we found us and the poet
held to the left and i move on behind
upon my right hand i beheld new anguish
new torment and new wielder of the lash
wherewith the foremost bolgia wa replet
down at the bottom were the sinner nake
thi side the middl came thei face us
beyond it with us but with greater step
even as the roman for the mighti host
the year of jubile upon the bridg
have chosen a mode to pass the peopl over
for all upon on side toward the castl
their face have and go unto st peter
on the other side thei go toward the mountain
thi side and that along the livid stone
beheld i horn demon with great scourg
who cruelli were beat them behind
ah me how thei did make them lift their leg
at the first blow and sooth not ani on
the second wait for nor for the third
while i wa go on mine ey by on
encount were and straight i said alreadi
with sight of thi on i am not unf
therefor i stai my feet to make him out
and with me the sweet guid came to a stand
and to my go somewhat back assent
and he the scourg on thought to hide himself
lower hi face but littl it avail him
for said i thou that castest down thine ey
if fals ar not the featur which thou bearest
thou art venedico caccianimico
but what doth bring thee to such pungent sauc
and he to me unwillingli i tell it
but forc me thine utter distinct
which make me recollect the ancient world
i wa the on who the fair ghisola
induc to grant the wish of the marqui
howeer the shameless stori mai be told
not the sole bolognes am i who weep here
nai rather is thi place so full of them
that not so mani tongu todai ar taught
twixt reno and savena to sai sipa
and if thereof thou wishest pledg or proof
bring to thy mind our avarici heart
while speak in thi manner with hi scourg
a demon smote him and said get thee gone
pander there ar no women here for coin
i join myself again unto mine escort
thereafterward with footstep few we came
to where a crag project from the bank
thi veri easili did we ascend
and turn to the right along it ridg
from those etern circl we depart
when we were there where it is hollow out
beneath to give a passag to the scourg
the guid said wait and see that on thee strike
the vision of those other evilborn
of whom thou hast not yet beheld the face
becaus togeth with us thei have gone
from the old bridg we look upon the train
which towrd us came upon the other border
and which the scourg in like manner smite
and the good master without my inquir
said to me see that tall on who is come
and for hi pain seem not to shed a tear
still what a royal aspect he retain
that jason is who by hi heart and cun
the colchian of the ram made destitut
he by the isl of lemno pass along
after the dare women pitiless
had unto death devot all their male
there with hi token and with ornat word
did he deceiv hypsipyl the maiden
who first herself had all the rest deceiv
there did he leav her pregnant and forlorn
such sin unto such punish condemn him
and also for medea is vengeanc done
with him go those who in such wise deceiv
and thi suffici be of the first vallei
to know and those that in it jaw it hold
we were alreadi where the narrow path
cross athwart the second dike and form
of that a buttress for anoth arch
thenc we heard peopl who ar make moan
in the next bolgia snort with their muzzl
and with their palm beat upon themselv
the margin were incrust with a mould
by exhal from below that stick there
and with the ey and nostril wage war
the bottom is so deep no place suffic
to give us sight of it without ascend
the arch back where most the crag impend
thither we came and thenc down in the moat
i saw a peopl smother in a filth
that out of human privi seem to flow
and whilst below there with mine ey i search
i saw on with hi head so foul with ordur
it wa not clear if he were clerk or layman
he scream to me wherefor art thou so eager
to look at me more than the other foul on
and i to him becaus if i rememb
i have alreadi seen thee with dry hair
and thourt alessio interminei of lucca
therefor i ey thee more than all the other
and he thereon belabour hi pumpkin
the flatteri have submerg me here below
wherewith my tongu wa never surfeit
then said to me the guid see that thou thrust
thy visag somewhat farther in advanc
that with thine ey thou well the face attain
of that uncleanli and dishevel drab
who there doth scratch herself with filthi nail
and crouch now and now on foot is stand

straightwai upon the fourth dike we arriv

whereat the spirit writh with both hi feet
then sigh with a voic of lament
said to me then what wantest thou of me

aught but the bubbl that the boil rais
and all swell up and resubsid compress
the while below there fixedli i gaze
my leader cry out bewar bewar
drew me unto himself from where i stood
then i turn round as on who is impati

and whom a sudden terror doth unman
who while he look delai not hi departur
and i beheld behind us a black devil
run along upon the crag approach
ah how feroci wa he in hi aspect
and how he seem to me in action ruthless
with open wing and light upon hi feet
hi shoulder which sharppoint were and high
a sinner did encumb with both haunch
and he held clutch the sinew of the feet
from off our bridg he said o malebranch
behold on of the elder of saint zita

all there ar barrat except bonturo
no into ye for monei there is chang
he hurl him down and over the hard crag
turn round and never wa a mastiff loosen
in so much hurri to pursu a thief
the other sank and rose again face downward
but the demon under cover of the bridg
cri here the santo volto ha no place

therefor if for our gaff thou wishest not
do not uplift thyself abov the pitch
thei seiz him then with more than a hundr rake
thei said it here behov thee to danc cover

be thou afraid becaus these thing i know
for onc befor wa i in such a scuffl
then he pass on beyond the bridg head
and as upon the sixth bank he arriv
need wa for him to have a steadfast front

the frog stand onli with their muzzl out

so that by rend he tore off a tendon
ek draghignazzo wish to pounc upon him

when thei again somewhat were pacifi
of him who still wa look at hi wound

whereat each on wa suddenli stung with shame

therefor he move and cri thou art oertakern
but littl it avail for wing could not

but sooth the other wa a doughti sparhawk
to clapperclaw him well and both of them
fell in the middl of the boil pond
a sudden intercessor wa the heat
but neertheless of rise there wa naught
to such degre thei had their wing belim
lament with the other barbariccia
made four of them fly to the other side

we from the bridg descend at it head
where it connect itself with the eighth bank

there where the neck is knot to the shoulder

it utter forth a voic and said when i
from circ had depart who conceal me
more than a year there near unto gaeta
or ever yet aenea name it so
nor fond for my son nor rever
for my old father nor the due affect
which joyou should have made penelop
could overcom within me the desir
i had to be experienc of the world
and of the vice and virtu of mankind
but i put forth on the high open sea
with on sole ship and that small compani
by which i never had desert been
both of the shore i saw as far as spain
far as morocco and the isl of sard
and the other which that sea bath round about
i and my compani were old and slow
when at that narrow passag we arriv
where hercul hi landmark set as signal
that man no farther onward should adventur
on the right hand behind me left i sevil
and on the other alreadi had left ceuta
o brother who amid a hundr thousand
peril i said have come unto the west
to thi so inconsider vigil
which is remain of your sens still
be ye unwil to deni the knowledg
follow the sun of the unpeopl world
consid ye the seed from which ye sprang
ye were not made to live like unto brute
but for pursuit of virtu and of knowledg
so eager did i render my companion
with thi brief exhort for the voyag
that then i hardli could have held them back
and have turn our stern unto the morn
we of the oar made wing for our mad flight
evermor gain on the larboard side
alreadi all the star of the other pole
the night beheld and our so veri low
it did not rise abov the ocean floor
five time rekindl and as mani quench
had been the splendour underneath the moon
sinc we had enter into the deep pass
when there appear to us a mountain dim
from distanc and it seem to me so high
as i had never ani on beheld
joy were we and soon it turn to weep
for out of the new land a whirlwind rose
and smote upon the fore part of the ship
three time it made her whirl with all the water
at the fourth time it made the stern uplift
and the prow downward go as pleas anoth
until the sea abov us close again
inferno canto xxvii
alreadi wa the flame erect and quiet
to speak no more and now depart from us
with the permiss of the gentl poet
when yet anoth which behind it came
caus us to turn our ey upon it top
by a confus sound that issu from it
as the sicilian bull that bellow first
with the lament of him and that wa right
who with hi file had modul it
bellow so with the voic of the afflict
that notwithstand it wa made of brass
still it appear with agoni transfix

at first from out the fire to it own languag
convert were the melancholi word
but afterward when thei had gather wai
up through the point give it that vibrat
the tongu had given them in their passag out
we heard it said o thou at whom i aim
my voic and who but now wast speak lombard
sai now go thy wai no more i urg thee
becaus i come perchanc a littl late
to stai and speak with me let it not irk thee
thou seest it irk not me and i am burn
if thou but late into thi blind world
hast fallen down from that sweet latian land
wherefrom i bring the whole of my transgress
sai if the romagnuol have peac or war
for i wa from the mountain there between
urbino and the yoke whenc tiber burst
i still wa downward bent and listen
when my conductor touch me on the side
sai speak thou thi on a latian is
and i who had beforehand my repli
in readi forthwith began to speak
o soul that down below there art conceal
romagna thine is not and never ha been
without war in the bosom of it tyrant
but open war i none have left there now
ravenna stand as it long year ha stood
the eagl of polenta there is brood
so that she cover cervia with her van
the citi which onc made the long resist
and of the french a sanguinari heap
beneath the green paw find itself again
verrucchio ancient mastiff and the new
who made such bad dispos of montagna
where thei ar wont make wimbl of their teeth
the citi of lamon and santerno
govern the lioncel of the white lair
who chang side twixt summertim and winter
and that of which the savio bath the flank
even as it li between the plain and mountain
live between tyranni and a free state
now i entreat thee tell us who thou art
be not more stubborn than the rest have been
so mai thy name hold front there in the world
after the fire a littl more had roar
in it own fashion the sharp point it move
thi wai and that and then gave forth such breath
if i believ that my repli were made
to on who to the world would eer return
thi flame without more flicker would stand still
but inasmuch as never from thi depth
did ani on return if i hear true
without the fear of infami i answer
i wa a man of arm then cordeli
believ thu begirt to make amend
and truli my belief had been fulfil
but for the high priest whom mai ill betid
who put me back into my former sin
and how and wherefor i will have thee hear
while i wa still the form of bone and pulp
my mother gave to me the deed i did
were not those of a lion but a fox
the machin and the covert wai
i knew them all and practis so their craft
that to the end of earth the sound went forth
when now unto that portion of mine ag
i saw myself arriv when each on ought
to lower the sail and coil awai the rope
that which befor had pleas me then displeas me
and penit and confess i surrend
ah woe is me and it would have bestead me

but even as constantin sought out sylvest
to cure hi leprosi within soract
so thi on sought me out as an adept
to cure him of the fever of hi pride

becaus hi word appear inebri
and then he said be not thy heart afraid
henceforth i thee absolv and thou instruct me
how to raze palestrina to the ground

then urg me on hi weighti argument

and said i father sinc thou washest me
of that sin into which i now must fall

franci came afterward when i wa dead
for me but on of the black cherubim
said to him take him not do me no wrong
he must come down among my servitor
becaus he gave the fraudul advic
from which time forth i have been at hi hair
for who repent not cannot be absolv
nor can on both repent and will at onc
becaus of the contradict which consent not
o miser me how i did shudder
when he seiz on me sai peradventur
thou didst not think that i wa a logician
he bore me unto mino who entwin
eight time hi tail about hi stubborn back
and after he had bitten it in great rage

my master made repli to be torment

thou hast not done so at the other bolg
consid if to count them thou believest

if thou hadst i made answer thereupon

perhap a longer stai thou wouldst have pardon
meanwhil my guid depart and behind him
i went alreadi make my repli

i held mine ey with such attent fix
i think a spirit of my blood lament
the sin which down below there cost so much
then said the master be no longer broken
thy thought from thi time forward upon him
attend elsewher and there let him remain
for him i saw below the littl bridg
point at thee and threaten with hi finger

made him disdain whenc he went awai
as i imagin without speak to me
and therebi made me piti him the more
thu did we speak as far as the first place
upon the crag which the next vallei show
down to the bottom if there were more light
when we were now right over the last cloister
of malebolg so that it laybroth
could manifest themselv unto our sight
diver lament pierc me through and through
which with compass had their arrow barb
whereat mine ear i cover with my hand
what pain would be if from the hospit

all the diseas in on moat were gather
such wa it here and such a stench came from it
as from putresc limb is wont to issu
we had descend on the furthest bank
from the long crag upon the left hand still
and then more vivid wa my power of sight
down towrd the bottom where the ministress

i do not think a sadder sight to see
wa in aegina the whole peopl sick
when wa the air so full of pestil

were from the seed of ant restor again
than wa it to behold through that dark vallei
the spirit languish in diver heap
thi on the belli that upon the back
on of the other lai and other crawl
shift themselv along the dismal road
we step by step went onward without speech
gaze upon and listen to the sick
who had not strength enough to lift their bodi
i saw two sit lean against each other
as lean in heat platter against platter
from head to foot bespot oer with scab
and never saw i pli a currycomb
by stableboi for whom hi master wait
or him who keep awak unwillingli
as everi on wa ply fast the bite
of nail upon himself for the great rage
of itch which no other succour had
and the nail downward with them drag the scab
in fashion as a knife the scale of bream
or ani other fish that ha them largest
o thou that with thy finger dost dismail thee
began my leader unto on of them

tell me if ani latian is with those

both of us here on weep made repli
but who art thou that questionest about us
and said the guid on am i who descend

then broken wa their mutual support

that i could rise by flight into the air
and he who had conceit but littl wit
would have me show to him the art and onli
becaus no daedalu i made him made me

and after the two maniac had pass
on whom i held mine ey i turn it back

just at the point at which a man is fork
the heavi dropsi that so disproport

for far more doth their imag dry me up

the rigid justic that chastis me
draweth occas from the place in which
i sin to put the more my sigh in flight
there is romena where i counterfeit

so that it ting the on cheek and the other
and then held out to me the medicin
thu do i hear that onc achil spear
hi and hi father us to be the caus
first of a sad and then a graciou boon
we turn our back upon the wretch vallei
upon the bank that gird it round about
go across it without ani speech
there it wa less than night and less than dai
so that my sight went littl in advanc
but i could hear the blare of a loud horn
so loud it would have made each thunder faint
which counter to it follow it wai
mine ey direct wholli to on place
after the dolor discomfitur
when charlemagn the holi empris lost
so terribl orlando sound not
short while my head turn thitherward i held

athwart the dark at too great a distanc
it happen that thou errest in thy fanci
well shalt thou see if thou arrivest there
how much the sens deceiv itself by distanc
therefor a littl faster spur thee on
then tenderli he took me by the hand
and said befor we farther have advanc
that the realiti mai seem to thee
less strang know that these ar not tower but giant
and thei ar in the well around the bank
from navel downward on and all of them
as when the fog is vanish awai
littl by littl doth the sight refigur
whateer the mist that crowd the air conceal
so pierc through the dens and darksom air
more and more near approach towrd the verg
my error fled and fear came over me
becaus as on it circular parapet
montereggion crown itself with tower
een thu the margin which surround the well
with on half of their bodi turret
the horribl giant whom jove menac
een now from out the heaven when he thunder
and i of on alreadi saw the face
shoulder and breast and great part of the belli
and down along hi side both of the arm
certainli natur when she left the make
of anim like these did well inde
by take such executor from mar
and if of eleph and whale she doth not
repent her whosoev looketh subtli
more just and more discreet will hold her for it
for where the argument of intellect
is ad unto evil will and power
no rampart can the peopl make against it
hi face appear to me as long and larg
as is at rome the pinecon of saint peter
and in proport were the other bone
so that the margin which an apron wa
down from the middl show so much of him
abov it that to reach up to hi hair
three friesland in vain had vaunt them
for i beheld thirti great palm of him
down from the place where man hi mantl buckl
raphael mai amech izabi almi
began to clamour the feroci mouth
to which were not befit sweeter psalm
and unto him my guid soul idiot
keep to thy horn and vent thyself with that
when wrath or other passion touch thee
search round thy neck and thou wilt find the belt
which keep it fasten o bewild soul
and see it where it bar thy mighti breast
then said to me he doth himself accus
thi on is nimrod by whose evil thought
on languag in the world is not still us
here let us leav him and not speak in vain
for even such to him is everi languag
as hi to other which to none is known
therefor a longer journei did we make
turn to the left and a crossbowshot oft
we found anoth far more fierc and larg
in bind him who might the master be
i cannot sai but he had pinion close
behind the right arm and in front the other
with chain that held him so begirt about
from the neck down that on the part uncov
it wound itself as far as the fifth gyre
thi proud on wish to make experi
of hi own power against the suprem jove
my leader said whenc he ha such a guerdon
ephialt is hi name he show great prowess
what time the giant terrifi the god
the arm he wield never more he move
and i to him if possibl i should wish
that of the measureless briareu
these ey of mine might have experi
whenc he repli thou shalt behold antaeu
close by here who can speak and is unbound
who at the bottom of all crime shall place us
much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see
and he is bound and fashion like to thi on
save that he seem in aspect more feroci
there never wa an earthquak of such might
that it could shake a tower so violent
as ephialt suddenli shook himself
then wa i more afraid of death than ever
for noth more wa need than the fear
if i had not beheld the manacl
then we proceed farther in advanc
and to antaeu came who full five ell
without the head forth issu from the cavern
o thou who in the vallei fortun
which scipio the heir of glori made
when hannib turn back with all hi host
onc broughtst a thousand lion for thy prei

among thy brother some it seem still think
the son of earth the victori would have gain
place us below nor be disdain of it
there where the cold doth lock cocytu up
make us not go to tityu nor typhoeu
thi on can give of that which here is long for
therefor stoop down and do not curl thy lip
still in the world can he restor thy fame
becaus he live and still expect long life
if to itself grace call him not untim
so said the master and in hast the other

whore in the place to speak of which is hard
twere better ye had here been sheep or goat
when we were down within the darksom well
beneath the giant feet but lower far
and i wa scan still the lofti wall
i heard it said to me look how thou steppest
take heed thou do not trampl with thy feet
the head of the tire miser brother
whereat i turn me round and saw befor me
and underfoot a lake that from the frost
the semblanc had of glass and not of water
so thick a veil neer made upon it current
in wintertim danub in austria
nor there beneath the frigid sky the don
as there wa here so that if tambernich

and as to croak the frog doth place himself

when round about me somewhat i had look

the hair upon their head togeth mingl

i said who ar you and thei bent their neck
and when to me their face thei had lift
their ey which first were onli moist within
gush oer the eyelid and the frost congeal
the tear between and lock them up again
clamp never bound togeth wood with wood
so strongli whereat thei like two hegoat
but togeth so much wrath oercam them
and on who had by reason of the cold
lost both hi ear still with hi visag downward
said why dost thou so mirror thyself in us
if thou desir to know who these two ar

belong to them and to their father albert
thei from on bodi came and all caina

more worthi to be fix in gelatin
not he in whom were broken breast and shadow

so with hi head i see no farther forward
and bore the name of sassol mascheroni
well knowest thou who he wa if thou art tuscan
and that thou put me not to further speech

and while we were advanc towrd the middl

for ill thou knowest to flatter in thi hollow
then by the scalp behind i seiz upon him
and said it must need be thou name thyself
or not a hair remain upon thee here
whenc he to me though thou strip off my hair
i will not tell thee who i am nor show thee

now i will tell thee why i am such a neighbour
that by effect of hi malici thought

that is to sai how cruel wa my death
hear shalt thou and shalt know if he ha wrong me
a narrow perfor in the mew
which bear becaus of me the titl of famin
and in which other still must be lock up

alreadi when i dream the evil dream
which of the futur rent for me the veil
thi on appear to me as lord and master
hunt the wolf and whelp upon the mountain
for which the pisan cannot lucca see
with sleuthhound gaunt and eager and well train
gualandi with sismondi and lanfianchi
he had sent out befor him to the front
after brief cours seem unto me foresp
the father and the son and with sharp tush
it seem to me i saw their flank rip open
when i befor the morrow wa awak
moan amid their sleep i heard my son
who with me were and ask after bread
cruel inde art thou if yet thou griev not
think of what my heart forebod me
and weepst thou not what art thou wont to weep at
thei were awak now and the hour drew nigh
at which our food us to be brought to us
and through hi dream wa each on apprehens
and i heard lock up the under door
of the horribl tower whereat without a word
i gaze into the face of my son
i wept not i within so turn to stone
thei wept and darl littl anselm mine
said thou dost gaze so father what doth ail thee
still not a tear i shed nor answer made
all of that dai nor yet the night thereaft
until anoth sun rose on the world
as now a littl glimmer made it wai
into the dolor prison and i saw
upon four face my own veri aspect
both of my hand in agoni i bit
and think that i did it from desir
of eat on a sudden thei upros
and said thei father much less pain twill give us
if thou do eat of us thyself didst cloth us
with thi poor flesh and do thou strip it off
i calm me then not to make them more sad
that dai we all were silent and the next
ah obdur earth wherefor didst thou not open
when we had come unto the fourth dai gaddo
threw himself down outstretch befor my feet
sai my father why dost thou not help me
and there he di and as thou seest me
i saw the three fall on by on between
the fifth dai and the sixth whenc i betook me
alreadi blind to grope over each
and three dai call them after thei were dead
then hunger did what sorrow could not do
when he had said thi with hi ey distort
the wretch skull resum he with hi teeth
which as a dog upon the bone were strong
ah pisa thou opprobrium of the peopl
of the fair land there where the si doth sound
sinc slow to punish thee thy neighbour ar
let the capraia and gorgona move
and make a hedg across the mouth of arno
that everi person in thee it mai drown
for if count ugolino had the fame
of have in thy castl thee betrai
thou shouldst not on such cross have put hi son
guiltless of ani crime thou modern thebe
their youth made uguccion and brigata
and the other two my song doth name abov
we pass still farther onward where the ic
anoth peopl ruggedli enswath
not downward turn but all of them revers
weep itself there doe not let them weep
and grief that find a barrier in the ey
turn itself inward to increas the anguish
becaus the earliest tear a cluster form
and in the manner of a crystal visor
fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full
and notwithstand that as in a callu
becaus of cold all sensibl
it station had abandon in my face
still it appear to me i felt some wind
whenc i my master who set thi in motion
is not below here everi vapour quench
whenc he to me full soon shalt thou be where
thine ey shall answer make to thee of thi
see the caus which raineth down the blast
and on of the wretch of the frozen crust
cri out to us o soul so merciless
that the last post is given unto you
lift from mine ey the rigid veil that i
mai vent the sorrow which impregn my heart
a littl eer the weep recong
whenc i to him if thou wouldst have me help thee

toward us therefor look in front of thee
my master said if thou discernest him
as when there breath a heavi fog or when
our hemispher is darken into night
appear far off a mill the wind is turn
methought that such a build then i saw
and for the wind i drew myself behind
my guid becaus there wa no other shelter
now wa i and with fear in vers i put it
there where the shade were wholli cover up
and glimmer through like unto straw in glass
some prone ar ly other stand erect
thi with the head and that on with the sole
anoth bowlik face to feet invert
when in advanc so far we had proceed
that it my master pleas to show to me
the creatur who onc had the beauteou semblanc
he from befor me move and made me stop
sai behold di and behold the place
where thou with fortitud must arm thyself
how frozen i becam and powerless then
ask it not reader for i write it not
becaus all languag would be insuffici
i did not die and i aliv remain not
think for thyself now hast thou aught of wit
what i becam be of both depriv
the emperor of the kingdom dolor
from hi midbreast forth issu from the ic
and better with a giant i compar
than do the giant with those arm of hi
consid now how great must be that whole
which unto such a part conform itself
were he as fair onc as he now is foul
and lift up hi brow against hi maker
well mai proce from him all tribul
o what a marvel it appear to me
when i beheld three face on hi head
the on in front and that vermilion wa
two were the other that were join with thi
abov the middl part of either shoulder
and thei were join togeth at the crest
and the righthand on seem twixt white and yellow
the left wa such to look upon as those
who come from where the nile fall valleyward
underneath each came forth two mighti wing
such as befit were so great a bird
sail of the sea i never saw so larg
no feather had thei but as of a bat
their fashion wa and he wa wave them
so that three wind proceed forth therefrom
therebi cocytu wholli wa congeal
with six ey did he weep and down three chin
trickl the teardrop and the bloodi drivel
at everi mouth he with hi teeth wa crunch
a sinner in the manner of a brake
so that he three of them torment thu
to him in front the bite wa as naught
unto the claw for sometim the spine
utterli strip of all the skin remain
that soul up there which ha the greatest pain
the master said is juda iscariot
with head insid he pli hi leg without
of the two other who head downward ar
the on who hang from the black jowl is brutu
see how he writh himself and speak no word
and the other who so stalwart seem is cassiu
but night is reascend and ti time
that we depart for we have seen the whole
as seem him good i clasp him round the neck
and he the vantag seiz of time and place
and when the wing were open wide apart
he laid fast hold upon the shaggi side
from fell to fell descend downward then
between the thick hair and the frozen crust
when we were come to where the thigh revolv
exactli on the thick of the haunch
the guid with labour and with harddrawn breath
turn round hi head where he had had hi leg
and grappl to the hair as on who mount
so that to hell i thought we were return
keep fast thy hold for by such stair as these
the master said pant as on fatigu
must we perforc depart from so much evil
then through the open of a rock he issu
and down upon the margin seat me
then towrd me he outstretch hi wari step
i lift up mine ey and thought to see
lucif in the same wai i had left him
and i beheld him upward hold hi leg
and if i then becam disquiet
let stolid peopl think who do not see
what the point is beyond which i had pass
rise up the master said upon thy feet
the wai is long and difficult the road
and now the sun to middletierc return
it wa not ani palac corridor
there where we were but dungeon natur
with floor uneven and uneas of light
er from the abyss i tear myself awai
my master said i when i had arisen
to draw me from an error speak a littl
where is the ic and how is thi on fix
thu upsid down and how in such short time
from ev to morn ha the sun made hi transit
and he to me thou still imaginest
thou art beyond the centr where i grasp
the hair of the fell worm who mine the world
that side thou wast so long as i descend
when round i turn me thou didst pass the point
to which thing heavi draw from everi side
and now beneath the hemispher art come
opposit that which overhang the vast
dryland and neath whose cope wa put to death
the man who without sin wa born and live
thou hast thy feet upon the littl sphere
which make the other face of the judecca
here it is morn when it is even there
and he who with hi hair a stairwai made us
still fix remaineth as he wa befor
upon thi side he fell down out of heaven
and all the land that whilom here emerg
for fear of him made of the sea a veil
and came to our hemispher and peradventur
to flee from him what on thi side appear
left the place vacant here and back recoil
a place there is below from beelzebub
as far reced as the tomb extend
which not by sight is known but by the sound
of a small rivulet that there descendeth
through chasm within the stone which it ha gnaw
with cours that wind about and slightli fall
the guid and i into that hidden road
now enter to return to the bright world
and without care of have ani rest
we mount up he first and i the second
till i beheld through a round apertur
some of the beauteou thing that heaven doth bear
thenc we came forth to rebehold the star
purgatorio
purgatorio canto i
to run oer better water hoist it sail
the littl vessel of my geniu now
that leav behind itself a sea so cruel
and of that second kingdom will i sing
wherein the human spirit doth purg itself
and to ascend to heaven becometh worthi
but let dead poesi here rise again
o holi muse sinc that i am your
and here calliop somewhat ascend
my song accompani with that sound
of which the miser magpi felt
the blow so great that thei despair of pardon
sweet colour of the orient sapphir
that wa upgath in the cloudless aspect
of the pure air as far as the first circl
unto mine ey did recomm delight
soon as i issu forth from the dead air
which had with sad fill mine ey and breast
the beauteou planet that to love incit
wa make all the orient to laugh
veil the fish that were in her escort
to the right hand i turn and fix my mind
upon the other pole and saw four star
neer seen befor save by the primal peopl
rejoic in their flamelet seem the heaven
o thou septentrion and widow site
becaus thou art depriv of see these
when from regard them i had withdrawn
turn a littl to the other pole
there where the wain had disappear alreadi
i saw besid me an old man alon
worthi of so much rever in hi look
that more ow not to father ani son
a long beard and with white hair intermingl
he wore in semblanc like unto the tress
of which a doubl list fell on hi breast
the rai of the four consecr star
did so adorn hi counten with light
that him i saw as were the sun befor him
who ar you ye who counter the blind river
have fled awai from the etern prison
move those vener plume he said
who guid you or who ha been your lamp
in issu forth out of the night profound
that ever black make the infern vallei
the law of the abyss ar thei thu broken
or is there chang in heaven some council new
that be damn ye come unto my crag
then did my leader lai hi grasp upon me
and with hi word and with hi hand and sign
rever he made in me my knee and brow
then answer him i came not of myself
a ladi from heaven descend at whose prayer
i aid thi on with my compani
but sinc it is thy will more be unfold
of our condit how it truli is
mine cannot be that thi should be deni thee
thi on ha never hi last even seen
but by hi folli wa so near to it
that veri littl time wa there to turn
as i have said i unto him wa sent
to rescu him and other wai wa none
than thi to which i have myself betaken
iv shown him all the peopl of perdit
and now those spirit i intend to show
who purg themselv beneath thy guardianship
how i have brought him would be long to tell thee
virtu descendeth from on high that aid me
to lead him to behold thee and to hear thee
now mai it pleas thee to vouchsaf hi come
he seeketh liberti which is so dear
as knoweth he who life for her refus
thou knowst it sinc for her to thee not bitter
wa death in utica where thou didst leav
the vestur that will shine so the great dai
by us the etern edict ar not broken
sinc thi on live and mino bind not me
but of that circl i where ar the chast
ey of thy marcia who in look still prai thee
o holi breast to hold her as thine own
for her love then inclin thyself to us
permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go
i will take back thi grace from thee to her
if to be mention there below thou deignest
marcia so pleas wa unto mine ey
while i wa on the other side then said he
that everi grace she wish of me i grant
now that she dwell beyond the evil river
she can no longer move me by that law
which when i issu forth from there wa made
but if a ladi of heaven do move and rule thee
as thou dost sai no flatteri is need
let it suffic thee that for her thou ask me
go then and see thou gird thi on about
with a smooth rush and that thou wash hi face
so that thou cleans awai all stain therefrom
for twere not fit that the ey oercast
by ani mist should go befor the first
angel who is of those of paradis
thi littl island round about it base
below there yonder where the billow beat it
doth rush bear upon it washi ooz
no other plant that putteth forth the leaf
or that doth indur can there have life
becaus it yieldeth not unto the shock
thereaft be not thi wai your return
the sun which now is rise will direct you
to take the mount by easier ascent
with thi he vanish and i rais me up
without a word and wholli drew myself
unto my guid and turn mine ey to him
and he began son follow thou my step
let us turn back for on thi side declin
the plain unto it lower boundari
the dawn wa vanquish the matin hour
which fled befor it so that from afar
i recognis the trembl of the sea
along the solitari plain we went
as on who unto the lost road return
and till he find it seem to go in vain
as soon as we were come to where the dew
fight with the sun and be in a part
where shadow fall littl evapor
both of hi hand upon the grass outspread
in gentl manner did my master place
whenc i who of hi action wa awar
extend unto him my tear cheek
there did he make in me uncov wholli
that hue which hell had cover up in me
then came we down upon the desert shore
which never yet saw navig it water
ani that afterward had known return
there he begirt me as the other pleas
o marvel for even as he cull
the humbl plant such it sprang up again
suddenli there where he uproot it
purgatorio canto ii
alreadi had the sun the horizon reach
whose circl of meridian cover oer
jerusalem with it most lofti point
and night that opposit to him revolv
wa issu forth from gang with the scale
that fall from out her hand when she exceedeth
so that the white and the vermilion cheek
of beauti aurora where i wa
by too great ag were chang into orang
we still were on the border of the sea
like peopl who ar think of their road
who go in heart and with the bodi stai
and lo as when upon the approach of morn
through the gross vapour mar grow fieri red
down in the west upon the ocean floor
appear to memai i again behold it
a light along the sea so swiftli come
it motion by no flight of wing is equal
from which when i a littl had withdrawn
mine ey that i might question my conductor
again i saw it brighter grown and larger
then on each side of it appear to me
i knew not what of white and underneath it
littl by littl there came forth anoth
my master yet had utter not a word
while the first white into wing unfold
but when he clearli recognis the pilot
he cri make hast make hast to bow the knee
behold the angel of god fold thou thy hand
henceforward shalt thou see such offic
see how he scorneth human argument
so that nor oar he want nor other sail
than hi own wing between so distant shore
see how he hold them point up to heaven
fan the air with the etern pinion
that do not moult themselv like mortal hair
then as still nearer and more near us came
the bird divin more radiant he appear
so that near by the ey could not endur him
but down i cast it and he came to shore
with a small vessel veri swift and light
so that the water swallow naught thereof
upon the stern stood the celesti pilot
beatitud seem written in hi face
and more than a hundr spirit sat within
in exitu israel de aegypto
thei chant all togeth in on voic
with whatso in that psalm is after written
then made he sign of holi rood upon them
whereat all cast themselv upon the shore
and he depart swiftli as he came
the throng which still remain there unfamiliar
seem with the place all round about them gaze
as on who in new matter make essai
on everi side wa dart forth the dai
the sun who had with hi resplend shaft
from the midheaven chase forth the capricorn
when the new peopl lift up their face
toward us sai to us if ye know
show us the wai to go unto the mountain
and answer made virgiliu ye believ
perchanc that we have knowledg of thi place
but we ar stranger even as yourselv
just now we came a littl while befor you
anoth wai which wa so rough and steep
that mount will henceforth seem sport to us
the soul who had from see me draw breath
becom awar that i wa still aliv
pallid in their astonish becam
and as to messeng who bear the oliv
the peopl throng to listen to the new
and no on show himself afraid of crowd
so at the sight of me stood motionless
those fortun spirit all of them as if
oblivi to go and make them fair
on from among them saw i come forward
as to embrac me with such great affect
that it incit me to do the like
o empti shadow save in aspect onli
three time behind it did i clasp my hand
as oft return with them to my own breast
i think with wonder i depict me
whereat the shadow smile and backward drew
and i pursu it press farther forward
gentli it said that i should stai my step
then knew i who it wa and i entreat
that it would stop awhil to speak with me
it made repli to me even as i love thee
in mortal bodi so i love thee free
therefor i stop but wherefor goest thou
my own casella to return onc more
there where i am i make thi journei said i
but how from thee ha so much time be taken
and he to me no outrag ha been done me
if he who take both when and whom he pleas
ha mani time deni to me thi passag
for of a righteou will hi own is made
he sooth to sai for three month past ha taken
whoever wish to enter with all peac
whenc i who now had turn unto that shore
where salt the water of the tiber grow
benignantli by him have been receiv
unto that outlet now hi wing is point
becaus for evermor assembl there
those who towrd acheron do not descend
and i if some new law take not from thee
memori or practic of the song of love
which us to quiet in me all my long
thee mai it pleas to comfort therewith
somewhat thi soul of mine that with it bodi
hitherward come is so much distress
love that within my mind discours with me
forthwith began he so melodi
the melodi within me still is sound
my master and myself and all that peopl
which with him were appear as satisfi
as if naught els might touch the mind of ani
we all of us were moveless and attent
unto hi note and lo the grave old man
exclaim what is thi ye laggard spirit
what neglig what stand still is thi
run to the mountain to strip off the slough
that let not god be manifest to you
even as when collect grain or tare
the dove togeth at their pastur met
quiet nor show their accustom pride
if aught appear of which thei ar afraid
upon a sudden leav their food alon
becaus thei ar assail by greater care
so that fresh compani did i behold
the song relinquish and go towrd the hill
as on who goe and know not whitherward
nor wa our own departur less in hast

inasmuch as the instantan flight

i press me close unto my faith comrad
and how without him had i kept my cours
who would have led me up along the mountain
he seem to me within himself remors
o nobl conscienc and without a stain
how sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee
after hi feet had laid asid the hast
which mar the digniti of everi act
my mind that hitherto had been restrain
let loos it faculti as if delight
and i my sight direct to the hill
that highest towrd the heaven uplift itself
the sun that in our rear wa flame red
wa broken in front of me into the figur
which had in me the stoppag of it rai
unto on side i turn me with the fear
of be left alon when i beheld
onli in front of me the ground obscur
why dost thou still mistrust my comfort
began to sai to me turn wholli round
dost thou not think me with thee and that i guid thee
ti even there alreadi where is buri
the bodi within which i cast a shadow
ti from brundusium taen and napl ha it
now if in front of me no shadow fall
marvel not at it more than at the heaven
becaus on rai impedeth not anoth
to suffer torment both of cold and heat
bodi like thi that power provid which will
that how it work be not unveil to us
insan is he who hopeth that our reason
can travers the illimit wai
which the on substanc in three person follow
mortal remain content at the quia
for if ye had been abl to see all
no need there were for mari to give birth
and ye have seen desir without fruit
those whose desir would have been quiet
which evermor is given them for a grief
i speak of aristotl and of plato
and mani othersand here bow hi head
and more he said not and remain disturb
we came meanwhil unto the mountain foot
there so precipit we found the rock
that nimbl leg would there have been in vain
twixt lerici and turbia the most desert
the most seclud pathwai is a stair
easi and open if compar with that
who knoweth now upon which hand the hill
slope down my master said hi footstep stai
so that who goeth without wing mai mount
and while he held hi ey upon the ground
examin the natur of the path
and i wa look up around the rock
on the left hand appear to me a throng
of soul that move their feet in our direct
and did not seem to move thei came so slowli
lift up thine ey i to the master said
behold on thi side who will give us counsel
if thou of thine own self can have it not
then he look at me and with frank express
repli let us go there for thei come slowli
and thou be steadfast in thy hope sweet son
still wa that peopl as far off from us
after a thousand step of our i sai
as a good thrower with hi hand would reach
when thei all crowd unto the hard mass
of the high bank and motionless stood and close
as he stand still to look who goe in doubt
o happi dead o spirit elect alreadi
virgiliu made begin by that peac
which i believ is wait for you all
tell us upon what side the mountain slope
so that the go up be possibl
for to lose time irk him most who most know
as sheep come issu forth from out the fold
by on and two and three and the other stand
timidli hold down their ey and nostril
and what the foremost doe the other do
huddl themselv against her if she stop
simpl and quiet and the wherefor know not
so move to approach us thereupon
i saw the leader of that fortun flock
modest in face and dignifi in gait
as soon as those in the advanc saw broken
the light upon the ground at my right side
so that from me the shadow reach the rock
thei stop and backward drew themselv somewhat
and all the other who came after them
not know why nor wherefor did the same
without your ask i confess to you
thi is a human bodi which you see
wherebi the sunshin on the ground is cleft
marvel ye not thereat but be persuad
that not without a power which come from heaven
doth he endeavour to surmount thi wall
the master thu and said those worthi peopl
return ye then and enter in befor us
make a signal with the back o the hand
and on of them began whoeer thou art
thu go turn thine ey consid well
if eer thou saw me in the other world
i turn me towrd him and look at him close
blond wa he beauti and of nobl aspect
but on of hi eyebrow had a blow divid
when with humil i had disclaim
eer have seen him now behold he said
and show me high upon hi breast a wound
then said he with a smile i am manfredi
the grandson of the empress costanza
therefor when thou returnest i beseech thee
go to my daughter beauti the mother
of sicili honour and of aragon
and the truth tell her if aught els be told
after i had my bodi lacer
by these two mortal stab i gave myself
weep to him who willingli doth pardon
horribl my iniqu had been
but infinit good hath such ampl arm
that it receiv whatev turn to it
had but cosenza pastor who in chase
of me wa sent by clement at that time
in god read understandingli thi page
the bone of my dead bodi still would be
at the bridgehead near unto benevento
under the safeguard of the heavi cairn
now the rain bath and moveth them the wind
beyond the realm almost besid the verd

of holi church though penit at last

thirti time told the time that he ha been

shorter by mean of righteou prayer becom
see now if thou hast power to make me happi

of thi i had experi posit
in hear and in gaze at that spirit
for fifti full degre uprisen wa

we came to where those soul with on accord
cri out unto us here is what you ask
a greater open ofttim hedg up
with but a littl fork of hi thorn
the villag what time the grape imbrown
than wa the passagewai through which ascend
onli my leader and myself behind him
after that compani depart from us
on climb sanleo and descend in noli
and mount the summit of bismantova
with feet alon but here on need must fly
with the swift pinion and the plume i sai
of great desir conduct after him
who gave me hope and made a light for me
we mount upward through the rift rock
and on each side the border press upon us
and feet and hand the ground beneath requir
when we were come upon the upper rim
of the high bank out on the open slope
my master said i what wai shall we take
and he to me no step of thine descend
still up the mount behind me win thy wai
till some sage escort shall appear to us
the summit wa so high it vanquish sight
and the hillsid precipit far more
than line from middl quadrant to the centr
spent with fatigu wa i when i began
o my sweet father turn thee and behold
how i remain alon unless thou stai
o son he said up yonder drag thyself
point me to a terrac somewhat higher
which on that side encircl all the hill
these word of hi so spur me on that i
strain everi nerv behind him scrambl up
until the circl wa beneath my feet
thereon ourselv we seat both of us
turn to the east from which we had ascend
for all men ar delight to look back
to the low shore mine ey i first direct
then to the sun uplift them and wonder
that on the left hand we were smitten by it
the poet well perceiv that i wa wholli
bewild at the chariot of the light
where twixt us and the aquilon it enter
whereon he said to me if castor and pollux
were in the compani of yonder mirror
that up and down conducteth with it light
thou wouldst behold the zodiac jag wheel
revolv still more near unto the bear
unless it swerv asid from it old track
how that mai be wouldst thou have power to think
collect in thyself imagin zion
togeth with thi mount on earth to stand
so that thei both on sole horizon have
and hemispher divers wherebi the road
which phaeton ala knew not to drive
thoult see how of necess must pass
thi on on side when that upon the other
if thine intellig right clearli heed
truli my master said i never yet
saw i so clearli as i now discern
there where my wit appear incompet
that the midcircl of supern motion
which in some art is the equat call
and ay remain between the sun and winter
for reason which thou sayest departeth henc
towrd the septentrion what time the hebrew
beheld it towrd the region of the heat
but if it pleaseth thee i fain would learn
how far we have to go for the hill rise
higher than ey of mine have power to rise
and he to me thi mount is such that ever
at the begin down below ti tiresom
and ay the more on climb the less it hurt
therefor when it shall seem so pleasant to thee
that go up shall be to thee as easi
as go down the current in a boat
then at thi pathwai end thou wilt be
there to repos thy pant breath expect
no more i answer and thi i know for true
and as he finish utter these word
a voic close by us sound peradventur
thou wilt have need of sit down er that
at sound thereof each on of us turn round
and saw upon the left hand a great rock
which neither i nor he befor had notic
thither we drew and there were person there
who in the shadow stood behind the rock
as on through indol is wont to stand
and on of them who seem to me fatigu
wa sit down and both hi knee embrac
hold hi face low down between them bow
o my sweet lord i said do turn thine ey
on him who show himself more neglig
then even sloth herself hi sister were
then he turn round to us and he gave heed
just lift up hi ey abov hi thigh
and said now go thou up for thou art valiant
then knew i who he wa and the distress
that still a littl did my breath quicken
my go to him hinder not and after
i came to him he hardli rais hi head
sai hast thou seen clearli how the sun
oer thy left shoulder drive hi chariot
hi sluggish attitud and hi curt word
a littl unto laughter move my lip
then i began belacqua i griev not
for thee henceforth but tell me wherefor seat
in thi place art thou waitest thou an escort
or ha thy usual habit seiz upon thee
and he o brother what the us of climb
sinc to my torment would not let me go
the angel of god who sitteth at the gate
first heaven must need so long revolv me round
outsid thereof as in my life it did
sinc the good sigh i to the end postpon
unless eer that some prayer mai bring me aid
which rise from a heart that live in grace
what profit other that in heaven ar heard not
meanwhil the poet wa befor me mount
and sai come now see the sun ha touch

purgatorio canto v
i had alreadi from those shade depart

on shout see it seem as if shone not
the sunshin on the left of him below
and like on live seem he to conduct him
mine ey i turn at utter of these word
and saw them watch with astonish
but me but me and the light which wa broken
why doth thy mind so occupi itself
the master said that thou thy pace dost slacken
what matter it to thee what here is whisper
come after me and let the peopl talk
stand like a steadfast tower that never wag
it top for all the blow of the wind
for evermor the man in whom is spring
thought upon thought remov from him the mark
becaus the forc of on the other weaken
what could i sai in answer but i come
i said it somewhat with that colour ting
which make a man of pardon sometim worthi
meanwhil along the mountainsid across
came peopl in advanc of us a littl
sing the miserer vers by vers
when thei becam awar i gave no place
for passag of the sunshin through my bodi
thei chang their song into a long hoars oh
and two of them in form of messeng
ran forth to meet us and demand of us
of your condit make us cognis
and said my master ye can go your wai
and carri back again to those who sent you
that thi on bodi is of veri flesh
if thei stood still becaus thei saw hi shadow
as i suppos enough is answer them
him let them honour it mai profit them
vapour enkindl saw i neer so swiftli
at earli nightfal cleav the air seren
nor at the set of sun the cloud of august
but upward thei return in briefer time
and on arriv with the other wheel
towrd us like troop that run without a rein
thi folk that press unto us is great
and cometh to implor thee said the poet
so still go onward and in go listen
o soul that goest to beatitud
with the same member wherewith thou wast born
shout thei came a littl stai thy step
look if thou eer hast ani of us seen
so that oer yonder thou bear new of him
ah why dost thou go on ah why not stai
long sinc we all were slain by violenc
and sinner even to the latest hour
then did a light from heaven admonish us
so that both penit and pardon forth
from life we issu reconcil to god
who with desir to see him stir our heart

there where i thought to be the most secur
twa he of est had it done who held me
in hatr far beyond what justic will
but if toward the mira i had fled
when i wa overtaken at oriaco
i still should be oer yonder where men breath
i ran to the lagoon and reed and mire
did so entangl me i fell and saw there
a lake made from my vein upon the ground
then said anoth ah be that desir

thereon my lord as if in wonder said
do thou conduct us thither where thou sayest

littl had we withdrawn us from that place
when i perceiv the mount wa hollow out
in fashion as the vallei here ar hollow
thitherward said that shade will we repair
where of itself the hillsid make a lap
and there for the new dai will we await
twixt hill and plain there wa a wind path
which led us to the margin of that dell

purgatorio canto viii
twa now the hour that turneth back desir
in those who sail the sea and melt the heart
the dai theyv said to their sweet friend farewel
and the new pilgrim penetr with love
if he doth hear from far awai a bell
that seemeth to deplor the dy dai
when i began to make of no avail
my hear and to watch on of the soul
uprisen that beg attent with it hand
it join and lift upward both it palm
fix it ey upon the orient
as if it said to god naught els i care for
te luci ant so devoutli issu
forth from it mouth and with such dulcet note
it made me issu forth from my own mind
and then the other sweetli and devoutli
accompani it through all the hymn entir
have their ey on the supern wheel
here reader fix thine ey well on the truth
for now inde so subtil is the veil
sure to penetr within is easi
i saw that armi of the gentleborn
thereafterward in silenc upward gaze
as if in expect pale and humbl
and from on high come forth and down descend
i saw two angel with two flame sword
truncat and depriv of their point
green as the littl leaflet just now born
their garment were which by their verdant pinion
beaten and blown abroad thei trail behind
on just abov us came to take hi station
and on descend to the opposit bank
so that the peopl were contain between them
clearli in them discern i the blond head
but in their face wa the ey bewild
as faculti confound by excess
from mari bosom both of them have come
sordello said as guardian of the vallei
against the serpent that will come anon
whereupon i who knew not by what road
turn round about and close drew myself
utterli frozen to the faith shoulder
and onc again sordello now descend we
mid the grand shade and we will speak to them
right pleasant will it be for them to see you
onli three step i think that i descend
and wa below and saw on who wa look
onli at me as if he fain would know me
alreadi now the air wa grow dark
but not so that between hi ey and mine
it did not show what it befor lock up
towrd me he move and i towrd him did move
nobl judg nino how it me delight
when i beheld thee not among the damn
no greet fair wa left unsaid between us
then ask he how long is it sinc thou camest
oer the far water to the mountain foot
oh said i to him through the dismal place
i came thi morn and am in the first life
albeit the other go thu i gain
and on the instant my repli wa heard
he and sordello both shrank back from me
like peopl who ar suddenli bewild
on to virgiliu and the other turn
to on who sat there cry up currado
come and behold what god in grace ha will
then turn to me by that especi grace
thou owest unto him who so conceal
hi own first wherefor that it ha no ford
when thou shalt be beyond the water wide
tell my giovanna that she prai for me
where answer to the innoc is made
i do not think her mother love me more
sinc she ha laid asid her wimpl white
which she unhappi need must wish again
through her full easili is comprehend
how long in woman last the fire of love
if ey or touch do not relight it often
so fair a hatchment will not make for her
the viper marshal the milanes
afield as would have made gallura cock
in thi wise spake he with the stamp impress
upon hi aspect of that righteou zeal
which measur burneth in the heart
my greedi ey still wander up to heaven
still to that point where slowest ar the star
even as a wheel the nearest to it axl
and my conductor son what dost thou gaze at
up there and i to him at those three torch
with which thi hither pole is all on fire
and he to me the four resplend star
thou sawest thi morn ar down yonder low
and these have mount up to where those were
as he wa speak to himself sordello
drew him and said lo there our adversari
and point with hi finger to look thither
upon the side on which the littl vallei
no barrier hath a serpent wa perchanc
the same which gave to ev the bitter food
twixt grass and flower came on the evil streak
turn at time it head about and lick
it back like to a beast that smooth itself
i did not see and therefor cannot sai
how the celesti falcon gan to move
but well i saw that thei were both in motion
hear the air cleft by their verdant wing
the serpent fled and round the angel wheel
up to their station fly back alik
the shade that to the judg had near approach
when he had call throughout that whole assault
had not a moment loos it gaze on me
so mai the light that leadeth thee on high
find in thine own freewil as much of wax
as need is up to the highest azur
began it if some true intellig
of valdimagra or it neighbourhood
thou knowest tell it me who onc wa great there
currado malaspina wa i call
im not the elder but from him descend
to mine i bore the love which here refineth
o said i unto him through your domain
i never pass but where is there a dwell
throughout all europ where thei ar not known
that fame which doeth honour to your hous
proclaim it signor and proclaim it land
so that he know of them who neer wa there
and as i hope for heaven i swear to you
your honour famili in naught abat
the glori of the purs and of the sword
it is so privileg by us and natur
that though a guilti head misguid the world
sole it goe right and scorn the evil wai
and he now go for the sun shall not lie
seven time upon the pillow which the ram
with all hi four feet cover and bestrid
befor that such a courteou opinion
shall in the middl of thy head be nail
with greater nail than of anoth speech
unless the cours of justic standeth still

the concubin of old tithonu now

with gem her forehead all reluc wa

which with it tail doth smite amain the nation
and of the step with which she mount the night
had taken two in that place where we were
and now the third wa bend down it wing
when i who someth had of adam in me
vanquish by sleep upon the grass reclin
there were all five of us alreadi sat
just at the hour when her sad lai begin
the littl swallow near unto the morn
perchanc in memori of her former woe
and when the mind of man a wander
more from the flesh and less by thought imprison
almost prophet in it vision is
in dream it seem to me i saw suspend
an eagl in the sky with plume of gold
with wing wide open and intent to stoop
and thi it seem to me wa where had been
by ganymed hi kith and kin abandon
when to the high consistori he wa rapt
i thought within myself perchanc he strike
from habit onli here and from elsewher
disdain to bear up ani in hi feet
then wheel somewhat more it seem to me
terribl as the lightn he descend
and snatch me upward even to the fire
therein it seem that he and i were burn
and the imagin fire did scorch me so
that of necess my sleep wa broken
not otherwis achil start up
around him turn hi awaken ey
and know not the place in which he wa
what time from chiron stealthili hi mother
carri him sleep in her arm to scyro
wherefrom the greek withdrew him afterward
than i upstart when from off my face
sleep fled awai and pallid i becam
as doth the man who freez with affright
onli my comfort wa at my side
and now the sun wa more than two hour high
and turn toward the seashor wa my face
be not intimid said my lord
be reassur for all is well with us
do not restrain but put forth all thy strength
thou hast at length arriv at purgatori
see there the cliff that close it around
see there the entranc where it seem disjoin
whilom at dawn which doth preced the dai
when inwardli thy spirit wa asleep
upon the flower that deck the land below
there came a ladi and said i am lucia
let me take thi on up who is asleep
so will i make hi journei easier for him
sordello and the other nobl shape
remain she took thee and as dai grew bright
upward she came and i upon her footstep
she laid thee here and first her beauteou ey
that open entranc point out to me
then she and sleep togeth went awai
in guis of on whose doubt ar reassur
and who to confid hi fear doth chang
after the truth ha been discov to him
so did i chang and when without disquiet
my leader saw me up along the cliff
he move and i behind him towrd the height
reader thou seest well how i exalt
my theme and therefor if with greater art
i fortifi it marvel not thereat
nearer approach we and were in such place
that there where first appear to me a rift
like to a crevic that dispart a wall
i saw a portal and three stair beneath
divers in colour to go up to it
and a gatekeep who yet spake no word
and as i open more and more mine ey
i saw him seat on the highest stair
such in the face that i endur it not
and in hi hand he had a nake sword
which so reflect back the sunbeam towrd us
that oft in vain i lift up mine ey
tell it from where you ar what ist you wish
began he to exclaim where is the escort
take heed your come hither harm you not
a ladi of heaven with these thing convers
my master answer him but even now
said to us thither go there is the portal
and mai she speed your footstep in all good
again began the courteou janitor
come forward then unto these stair of our
thither did we approach and the first stair
wa marbl white so polish and so smooth
i mirror myself therein as i appear
the second tinct of deeper hue than pers
wa of a calcin and uneven stone
crack all asund lengthwis and across
the third that uppermost rest massiv
porphyri seem to me as flame red
as blood that from a vein is spirt forth
both of hi feet wa hold upon thi
the angel of god upon the threshold seat
which seem to me a stone of diamond
along the three stair upward with good will
did my conductor draw me sai ask
humbl that he the fasten mai undo
devoutli at the holi feet i cast me
for merci sake besought that he would open
but first upon my breast three time i smote
seven ps upon my forehead he describ
with the sword point and take heed that thou wash
these wound when thou shalt be within he said
ash or earth that dry is excav
of the same colour were with hi attir
and from beneath it he drew forth two kei
on wa of gold and the other wa of silver
first with the white and after with the yellow
pli he the door so that i wa content
whenev faileth either of these kei
so that it turn not rightli in the lock
he said to us thi entranc doth not open
more preciou on is but the other need
more art and intellect er it unlock
for it is that which doth the knot unloos
from peter i have them and he bade me err
rather in open than in keep shut
if peopl but fall down befor my feet
then push the portal of the sacr door
exclaim enter but i give you warn
that forth return whoever look behind
and when upon their hing were turn round
the swivel of that consecr gate
which ar of metal massiv and sonor
roar not so loud nor so discord seem
tarpeia when wa taen from it the good
metellu wherefor meagr it remain
at the first thunderp i turn attent
and te deum laudamu seem to hear
in voic mingl with sweet melodi
exactli such an imag render me
that which i heard as we ar wont to catch
when peopl sing with the organ stand
for now we hear and now hear not the word

when we had cross the threshold of the door
which the pervert love of soul disus
becaus it make the crook wai seem straight
reecho i heard it close again
and if i had turn back mine ey upon it
what for my fail had been fit excus
we mount upward through a rift rock
which undul to thi side and that
even as a wave reced and advanc
here it behov us us a littl art
began my leader to adapt ourselv
now here now there to the reced side
and thi our footstep so infrequ made
that sooner had the moon decreas disk
regain it bed to sink again to rest
than we were forth from out that needl ey
but when we free and in the open were
there where the mountain backward pile itself
i weari out and both of us uncertain
about our wai we stop upon a plain
more desol than road across the desert
from where it margin border on the void
to foot of the high bank that ever rise
a human bodi three time told would measur
and far as ey of mine could wing it flight
now on the left and on the right flank now
the same thi cornic did appear to me
thereon our feet had not been move as yet
when i perceiv the embank round about
which all right of ascent had interdict
to be of marbl white and so adorn
with sculptur that not onli polycletu
but natur self had there been put to shame
the angel who came down to earth with tide
of peac that had been wept for mani a year
and open heaven from it long interdict
in front of us appear so truthfulli
there sculptur in a graciou attitud
he did not seem an imag that is silent
on would have sworn that he wa sai av

who turn the kei to op the exalt love
and in her mien thi languag had impress
ecc ancilla dei as distinctli
as ani figur stamp itself in wax
keep not thy mind upon on place alon

wherefor i pass virgiliu and drew near
so that befor mine ey it might be set

which after michal glimmer white upon me
there the high glori of the roman princ

in attitud of weep and of grief
around about him seem it throng and full

the wretch woman in the midst of these

how god ordaineth that the debt be paid
attend not to the fashion of the torment

from prick of remembr which alon

so saw i there but of a better semblanc
in point of artific with figur cover
whateer as pathwai from the mount project
i saw that on who wa creat nobl
more than all other creatur down from heaven
flame with lightn fall upon on side

between thy seven and seven children slain
o saul how fallen upon thy proper sword

that felt thereaft neither rain nor dew
o mad arachn so i thee beheld

of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee
o rehoboam no more seem to threaten

now wax ye proud and on with look uplift

so that ye mai behold your evil wai
more of the mount by us wa now encompass
and far more spent the circuit of the sun
than had the mind preoccupi imagin
when he who ever watch in advanc
wa go on began lift up thy head
ti no more time to go thu medit
lo there an angel who is make hast
to come toward us lo return is
from servic of the dai the sixth handmaiden
with rever thine act and look adorn
so that he mai delight to speed us upward
think that thi dai will never dawn again
i wa familiar with hi admonit
ever to lose no time so on thi theme
he could not unto me speak covertli
toward us came the be beauti

such as appear the tremul morn star
hi arm he open and open then hi wing
come said he near at hand here ar the step
and easi from henceforth is the ascent
at thi announc few ar thei who come
o human creatur born to soar aloft
why fall ye thu befor a littl wind
he led us on to where the rock wa cleft
there smote upon my forehead with hi wing
then a safe passag promis unto me
as on the right hand to ascend the mount
where seat is the church that lordeth it
oer the wellguid abov rubacont
the bold abrupt of the ascent is broken
by stairwai that were made there in the ag
when still were safe the ledger and the stave
een thu attemp is the bank which fall
sheer downward from the second circl there
but on thi side and that the high rock graze
as we were turn thitherward our person
beati pauper spiritu voic
sang in such wise that speech could tell it not
ah me how differ ar these entranc
from the infern for with anthem here
on enter and below with wild lament
we now were hunt up the sacr stair
and it appear to me by far more easi
than on the plain it had appear befor
whenc i my master sai what heavi thing
ha been uplift from me so that hardli
aught of fatigu is felt by me in walk
he answer when the ps which have remain
still on thy face almost obliter
shall wholli as the first is be eras
thy feet will be so vanquish by good will
that not alon thei shall not feel fatigu
but urg up will be to them delight
then did i even as thei do who ar go
with someth on the head to them unknown
unless the sign of other make them doubt
wherefor the hand to ascertain is help
and seek and find and doth fulfil the offic
which cannot be accomplish by the sight
and with the finger of the right hand spread
i found but six the letter that had carv

purgatorio canto xiii
we were upon the summit of the stair
where for the second time is cut awai
the mountain which ascend shriveth all
there in like manner doth a cornic bind
the hill all round about as doe the first
save that it arc more suddenli is curv
shade is there none nor sculptur that appear
so seem the bank and so the road seem smooth
with but the livid colour of the stone
if to inquir we wait for peopl here
the poet said i fear that peradventur
too much delai will our elect have
then steadfast on the sun hi ey he fix
made hi right side the centr of hi motion

o thou sweet light with trust in whom i enter
upon thi novel journei do thou lead us
said he as on within here should be led
thou warmest the world thou shinest over it
if other reason prompt not otherwis
thy rai should evermor our leader be
as much as here is count for a mile
so much alreadi there had we advanc
in littl time by dint of readi will
and towrd us there were heard to fly albeit
thei were not visibl spirit utter
unto love tabl courteou invit
the first voic that pass onward in it flight
vinum non habent said in accent loud
and went reiter it behind us
and er it wholli grew inaud
becaus of distanc pass anoth cry
i am orest and it also stai not
o said i father these what voic ar thei
and even as i ask behold the third
sai love those from whom ye have had evil
and the good master said thi circl scourg
the sin of envi and on that account
ar drawn from love the lash of the scourg
the bridl of anoth sound shall be
i think that thou wilt hear it as i judg
befor thou comest to the pass of pardon
but fix thine ey athwart the air right steadfast
and peopl thou wilt see befor us sit
and each on close against the cliff is seat
then wider than at first mine ey i open
i look befor me and saw shade with mantl
not from the colour of the stone divers
and when we were a littl farther onward
i heard a cry of mari prai for us
a cry of michael peter and all saint
i do not think there walketh still on earth
a man so hard that he would not be pierc
with piti at what afterward i saw
for when i had approach so near to them
that manifest to me their act becam
drain wa i at the ey by heavi grief
cover with sackcloth vile thei seem to me
and on sustain the other with hi shoulder
and all of them were by the bank sustain
thu do the blind in want of livelihood
stand at the door of church ask alm
and on upon anoth lean hi head
so that in other piti soon mai rise
not onli at the accent of their word
but at their aspect which no less implor
and as unto the blind the sun come not
so to the shade of whom just now i spake
heaven light will not be bounteou of itself
for all their lid an iron wire transpierc
and sew them up as to a sparhawk wild
is done becaus it will not quiet stai
to me it seem in pass to do outrag
see the other without be seen
wherefor i turn me to my counsel sage
well knew he what the mute on wish to sai
and therefor wait not for my demand
but said speak and be brief and to the point
i had virgiliu upon that side
of the embank from which on mai fall
sinc by no border ti engarland
upon the other side of me i had
the shade devout who through the horribl seam
press out the tear so that thei bath their cheek
to them i turn me and o peopl certain
began i of behold the high light
which your desir ha sole in it care
so mai grace speedili dissolv the scum
upon your conscienc that limpidli
through them descend the river of the mind
tell me for dear twill be to me and graciou
if ani soul among you here is latian

o brother mine each on is citizen
of on true citi but thy mean is
who mai have live in itali a pilgrim
by wai of answer thi i seem to hear
a littl farther on than where i stood
whereat i made myself still nearer heard
among the rest i saw a shade that wait
in aspect and should ani on ask how
it chin it lift upward like a blind man
spirit i said who stoopest to ascend
if thou art he who did repli to me
make thyself known to me by place or name
sienes wa i it repli and with
the other here recleans my guilti life
weep to him to lend himself to us
sapient i wa not although i sapia

more happi far than at my own good fortun
and that thou mayst not think that i deceiv thee
hear if i wa as foolish as i tell thee
the arc alreadi of my year descend
my fellowcitizen near unto coll

mine ey i said will yet be here taen from me
but for short space for small is the offenc

far greater is the fear wherein suspend
my soul is of the torment underneath
for even now the load down there weigh on me
and she to me who led thee then among us
up here if to return below thou thinkest
and i he who is with me and speak not

therefor with prayer of thine sometim assist me

purgatorio canto xiv
who is thi on that goe about our mountain
or ever death ha given him power of flight
and op hi ey and shut them at hi will
i know not who but know he not alon
ask him thyself for thou art nearer to him
and gentli so that he mai speak accost him
thu did two spirit lean towrd each other
discours about me there on the right hand
then held supin their face to address me
and said the on o soul that fasten still
within the bodi towrd the heaven art go
for chariti consol us and declar
whenc comest and who art thou for thou makst us
as much to marvel at thi grace of thine
as must a thing that never yet ha been
and i through midst of tuscani there wander
a streamlet that is born in falterona
and not a hundr mile of cours suffic it
from thereupon do i thi bodi bring
to tell you who i am were speech in vain
becaus my name as yet make no great nois
if well thy mean i can penetr
with intellect of mine then answer me
he who first spake thou speakest of the arno
and said the other to him why conceal
thi on the appel of that river
even as a man doth of thing horribl
and thu the shade that question wa of thi

ti fit the name of such a vallei perish
for from it fountainhead where is so pregnant
the alpin mountain whenc is cleft peloro
that in few place it that mark surpass
to where it yield itself in restor
of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up
whenc have the river that which goe with them
virtu is like an enemi avoid
by all as is a serpent through misfortun
of place or through bad habit that impel them
on which account have so transform their natur
the dweller in that miser vallei
it seem that circ had them in her pastur
mid ugli swine of acorn worthier

it first directeth it impoverish wai
cur findeth it thereaft come downward
more snarl than their puissanc demand
and turn from them disdainfulli it muzzl
it goe on fall and the more it grow
the more it find the dog becom wolv
thi maledict and misadventur ditch
descend then through mani a hollow gulf
it find the fox so replet with fraud
thei fear no cun that mai master them
nor will i ceas becaus anoth hear me
and well twill be for him if still he mind him
of what a truth spirit to me unravel
thy grandson i behold who doth becom
a hunter of those wolv upon the bank
of the wild stream and terrifi them all
he sell their flesh it be yet aliv
thereaft slaughter them like ancient beev
mani of life himself of prais depriv

he leav it such a thousand year from now
in it primev state ti not rewood
as at the announc of impend ill
the face of him who listen is disturb
from whateer side the peril seiz upon him
so i beheld that other soul which stood
turn round to listen grow disturb and sad
when it had gather to itself the word
the speech of on and aspect of the other
had me desir made to know their name
and question mix with prayer i made thereof
whereat the spirit which first spake to me
began again thou wishest i should bring me
to do for thee what thoult not do for me
but sinc god willeth that in thee shine forth
such grace of hi ill not be chari with thee
know then that i guido del duca am
my blood wa so with envi set on fire
that if i had beheld a man make merri
thou wouldst have seen me sprinkl oer with pallor
from my own sow such the straw i reap
o human race why dost thou set thy heart
where interdict of partnership must be
thi is renier thi is the boast and honour
of the hous of calboli where no on sinc
ha made himself the heir of hi desert
and not alon hi blood is made devoid
twixt po and mount and seashor and the reno
of good requir for truth and for divers
for all within these boundari is full
of venom root so that too tardili
by cultiv now would thei diminish
where is good lizio and arrigo manardi
pier traversaro and guido di carpigna
o romagnuoli into bastard turn
when in bologna will a fabbro rise
when in faenza a bernardin di fosco
the nobl scion of ignobl seed

when i rememb with guido da prata
ugolin d azzo who wa live with us
frederick tignoso and hi compani
the hous of traversara and th anastagi
and on race and the other is extinct
the dame and cavali the toil and eas
that fill our soul with love and courtesi
there where the heart have so malici grown
o brettinoro why dost thou not flee
see that all thy famili is gone
and mani peopl not to be corrupt
bagnacav doe well in not beget
and ill doe castrocaro and conio wors

will do well the pagani when their devil

will testimoni of them eer remain
o ugolin de fantoli secur
thy name is sinc no longer is await
on who degener can obscur it
but go now tuscan for it now delight me
to weep far better than it doe to speak
so much ha our discours my mind distress
we were awar that those belov soul
heard us depart therefor by keep silent
thei made us of our pathwai confid
when we becam alon by go onward
thunder when it doth cleav the air appear
a voic that counter to us came exclaim
shall slai me whosoev findeth me
and fled as the reverber di
if suddenli the cloud asund burst
as soon as hear had a truce from thi
behold anoth with so great a crash
that it resembl thunder follow fast
i am aglauru who becam a stone
and then to press myself close to the poet
i backward and not forward took a step
alreadi on all side the air wa quiet
and said he to me that wa the hard curb
that ought to hold a man within hi bound
but you take in the bait so that the hook
of the old adversari draw you to him
and henc availeth littl curb or call
the heaven ar call you and wheel around you
displai to you their etern beauti
and still your ey is look on the ground
whenc he who all discern chastis you
purgatorio canto xv
as much as twixt the close of the third hour
and dawn of dai appeareth of that sphere
which ay in fashion of a child is plai
so much it now appear toward the night
wa of hi cours remain to the sun
there it wa even and twa midnight here
and the rai smote the middl of our face
becaus by us the mount wa so encircl
that straight toward the west we now were go
when i perceiv my forehead overpow
beneath the splendour far more than at first
and stupor were to me the thing unknown
whereat toward the summit of my brow
i rais my hand and made myself the visor
which the excess glare diminish
as when from off the water or a mirror
the sunbeam leap unto the opposit side
ascend upward in the selfsam measur
that it descend and deviat as far
from fall of a stone in line direct
as demonstr experi and art
so it appear to me that by a light
refract there befor me i wa smitten
on which account my sight wa swift to flee
what is that father sweet from which i cannot
so fulli screen my sight that it avail me
said i and seem toward us to be move
marvel thou not if dazzl thee as yet
the famili of heaven he answer me
an angel ti who come to invit us upward
soon will it be that to behold these thing
shall not be grievou but delight to thee
as much as natur fashion thee to feel
when we had reach the angel benedight
with joy voic he said here enter in
to stairwai far less steep than ar the other
we mount were alreadi thenc depart
and beati misericord wa
behind us sung rejoic thou that oercomest
my master and myself we two alon
were go upward and i thought in go
some profit to acquir from word of hi
and i to him direct me thu ask
what did the spirit of romagna mean
mention interdict and partnership
whenc he to me of hi own greatest fail
he know the harm and therefor wonder not
if he reprov us that we less mai rue it
becaus ar thither point your desir
where by companionship each share is lessen
envi doth ply the bellow to your sigh
but if the love of the supern sphere
should upwardli direct your aspir
there would not be that fear within your breast
for there as much the more as on sai our
so much the more of good each on possess
and more of chariti in that cloister burn
i am more hunger to be satisfi
i said than if i had befor been silent
and more of doubt within my mind i gather
how can it be that boon distribut
the more possessor can more wealthi make
therein than if by few it be possess
and he to me becaus thou fixest still
thy mind entir upon earthli thing
thou pluckest dark from the veri light
that good infinit and ineff
which is abov there runneth unto love
as to a lucid bodi come the sunbeam
so much it give itself as it find ardour
so that as far as chariti extend
oer it increas the etern valour
and the more peopl thitherward aspir
more ar there to love well and more thei love there
and as a mirror on reflect the other
and if my reason appeas thee not
thou shalt see beatric and she will fulli
take from thee thi and everi other long
endeavour then that soon mai be extinct
as ar the two alreadi the five wound
that close themselv again by be pain
even as i wish to sai thou dost appeas me
i saw that i had reach anoth circl
so that my eager ey made me keep silenc
there it appear to me that in a vision
ecstat on a sudden i wa rapt
and in a templ mani person saw
and at the door a woman with the sweet
behaviour of a mother sai son
why in thi manner hast thou dealt with us
lo sorrow thy father and myself
were seek for theeand as here she ceas
that which appear at first had disappear
then i beheld anoth with those water
adown her cheek which grief distil whenev
from great disdain of other it is born
and sai if of that citi thou art lord
for whose name wa such strife among the god
and whenc doth everi scienc scintil
aveng thyself on those audaci arm
that clasp our daughter o pisistratu
and the lord seem to me benign and mild
to answer her with aspect temper
what shall we do to those who wish us ill
if he who love us be by us condemn
then saw i peopl hot in fire of wrath
with stone a young man slai clamor
still cry to each other kill him kill him
and him i saw bow down becaus of death
that weigh alreadi on him to the earth
but of hi ey made ever gate to heaven
implor the high lord in so great strife
that he would pardon those hi persecutor
with such an aspect as unlock compass
soon as my soul had outwardli return
to thing extern to it which ar true
did i my not fals error recogn
my leader who could see me bear myself
like to a man that rous him from sleep
exclaim what ail thee that thou canst not stand
but hast been come more than half a leagu
veil thine ey and with thy leg entangl
in guis of on whom wine or sleep subdu
o my sweet father if thou listen to me
ill tell thee said i what appear to me
when thu from me my leg were taen awai
and he if thou shouldst have a hundr mask
upon thy face from me would not be shut
thy cogit howsoev small
what thou hast seen wa that thou mayst not fail
to op thy heart unto the water of peac
which from the etern fountain ar diffus
i did not ask what ail thee as he doe
who onli looketh with the ey that see not
when of the soul bereft the bodi li
but ask it to give vigour to thy feet
thu must we need urg on the sluggard slow
to us their wake when it return
we pass along athwart the twilight peer
forward as far as ever ey could stretch
against the sunbeam serotin and lucent
and lo by slow degre a smoke approach
in our direct sombr as the night
nor wa there place to hide on self therefrom
thi of our ey and the pure air bereft us
purgatorio canto xvi
dark of hell and of a night depriv
of everi planet under a poor sky
as much as mai be tenebr with cloud
neer made unto my sight so thick a veil
as did that smoke which there envelop us
nor to the feel of so rough a textur
for not an ey it suffer to stai open
whereat mine escort faith and sagaci
drew near to me and offer me hi shoulder
een as a blind man goe behind hi guid
lest he should wander or should strike against
aught that mai harm or peradventur kill him
so went i through the bitter and foul air
listen unto my leader who said onli
look that from me thou be not separ
voic i heard and everi on appear
to supplic for peac and misericord
the lamb of god who take awai our sin
still agnu dei their exordium wa
on word there wa in all and metr on
so that all harmoni appear among them
master i said ar spirit those i hear
and he to me thou apprehendest truli
and thei the knot of anger go unloos
now who art thou that cleavest through our smoke
and art discours of us even as though
thou didst by calend still divid the time
after thi manner by a voic wa spoken
whereon my master said do thou repli
and ask if on thi side the wai go upward
and i o creatur that dost cleans thyself
to return beauti to him who made thee
thou shalt hear marvel if thou follow me
thee will i follow far as is allow me
he answer and if smoke prevent our see
hear shall keep us join instead thereof
thereon began i with that swath band
which death unwindeth am i go upward
and hither came i through the infern anguish
and if god in hi grace ha me infold
so that he will that i behold hi court
by method wholli out of modern usag
conceal not from me who er death thou wast
but tell it me and tell me if i go
right for the pass and be thy word our escort
lombard wa i and i wa marco call
the world i knew and love that excel
at which ha each on now unbent hi bow
for mount upward thou art go right
thu he made answer and subjoin i prai thee
to prai for me when thou shalt be abov
and i to him my faith i pledg to thee
to do what thou dost ask me but am burst
inli with doubt unless i rid me of it
first it wa simpl and is now made doubl
by thy opinion which make certain to me
here and elsewher that which i coupl with it
the world forsooth is utterli desert
by everi virtu as thou tellest me
and with iniqu is big and cover
but i beseech thee point me out the caus
that i mai see it and to other show it
for on in the heaven and here below on put it
a sigh profound that grief forc into ai
he first sent forth and then began he brother
the world is blind and sooth thou comest from it
ye who ar live everi caus refer
still upward to the heaven as if all thing
thei of necess move with themselv
if thi were so in you would be destroi
free will nor ani justic would there be
in have joi for good or grief for evil
the heaven your movement do initi
i sai not all but grant that i sai it
light ha been given you for good and evil
and free volit which if some fatigu
in the first battl with the heaven it suffer
afterward conquer all if well ti nurtur
to greater forc and to a better natur
though free ye subject ar and that creat
the mind in you the heaven have not in charg
henc if the present world doth go astrai
in you the caus is be it sought in you
and i therein will now be thy true spy
forth from the hand of him who fondl it
befor it is like to a littl girl
weep and laugh in her childish sport
issu the simpl soul that noth know
save that proceed from a joyou maker
gladli it turn to that which give it pleasur
of trivial good at first it tast the savour
is cheat by it and run after it
if guid or rein turn not asid it love
henc it behov law for a rein to place
behov a king to have who at the least
of the true citi should discern the tower
the law exist but who set hand to them
no on becaus the shepherd who preced
can rumin but cleaveth not the hoof
wherefor the peopl that perceiv it guid
strike onli at the good for which it hanker
feed upon that and farther seeketh not
clearli canst thou perceiv that evil guidanc
the caus is that ha made the world deprav
and not that natur is corrupt in you
rome that reform the world accustom wa
two sun to have which on road and the other
of god and of the world made manifest
on ha the other quench and to the crosier
the sword is join and ill beseemeth it
that by main forc on with the other go
becaus be join on feareth not the other
if thou believ not think upon the grain
for by it seed each herb is recogn
in the land lave by po and adig
valour and courtesi us to be found
befor that frederick had hi controversi
now in secur can pass that wai
whoever will abstain through sens of shame
from speak with the good or draw near them
true three old men ar left in whom upbraid
the ancient ag the new and late thei deem it
that god restor them to the better life
currado da palazzo and good gherardo
and guido da castel who better name is
in fashion of the french the simpl lombard
sai thou henceforward that the church of rome
confound in itself two govern
fall in the mire and soil itself and burden
o marco mine i said thou reasonest well
and now discern i why the son of levi
have been exclud from the heritag
but what gherardo is it who as sampl
of a lost race thou sayest ha remain
in reprob of the barbar ag
either thy speech deceiv me or it tempt me
he answer me for speak tuscan to me
it seem of good gherardo naught thou knowest
by other surnam do i know him not
unless i take it from hi daughter gaia
mai god be with you for i come no farther
behold the dawn that through the smoke rai out
alreadi whiten and i must depart
yonder the angel iser he appear
thu did he speak and would no farther hear me
purgatorio canto xvii
rememb reader if eer in the alp
a mist oertook thee through which thou couldst see
not otherwis than through it membran mole
how when the vapour humid and condens
begin to dissip themselv the sphere
of the sun feebli enter in among them
and thy imagin will be swift
in come to perceiv how i resaw
the sun at first that wa alreadi set
thu to the faith footstep of my master
mate mine own i issu from that cloud
to rai alreadi dead on the low shore
o thou imagin that dost steal us
so from without sometim that man perceiv not
although around mai sound a thousand trumpet
who moveth thee if sens impel thee not
move thee a light which in the heaven take form
by self or by a will that downward guid it
of her impieti who chang her form
into the bird that most delight in sing
in my imagin appear the trace
and hereupon my mind wa so withdrawn
within itself that from without there came
noth that then might be receiv by it
then reign within my lofti fantasi
on crucifi disdain and feroci
in counten and even thu wa dy
around him were the great ahasueru
esther hi wife and the just mordecai
who wa in word and action so entir
and even as thi imag burst asund
of it own self in fashion of a bubbl
in which the water it wa made of fail
there rose up in my vision a young maiden
bitterli weep and she said o queen
why hast thou wish in anger to be naught
thoust slain thyself lavinia not to lose
now hast thou lost me i am she who mourn
mother at thine er at anoth ruin
as sleep is broken when upon a sudden
new light strike in upon the eyelid close
and broken quiver er it dieth wholli
so thi imagin of mine fell down
as soon as the effulg smote my face
greater by far than what is in our wont
i turn me round to see where i might be
when said a voic here is the passag up
which from all other purpos remov me
and made my wish so full of eager
to look and see who wa it that wa speak
it never rest till meet face to face
but as befor the sun which quell the sight
and in it own excess it figur veil
even so my power wa insuffici here
thi is a spirit divin who in the wai
of go up direct us without ask
and who with hi own light himself conceal
he doe with us as man doth with himself
for he who see the need and wait the ask
malignli lean alreadi towrd denial
accord we now our feet to such invit
let us make hast to mount er it grow dark
for then we could not till the dai return
thu my conductor said and i and he
togeth turn our footstep to a stairwai
and i as soon as the first step i reach
near me perceiv a motion as of wing
and fan in the face and sai beati
pacifici who ar without ill anger
alreadi over us were so uplift
the latest sunbeam which the night pursu
that upon mani side the star appear
o manhood mine why dost thou vanish so
i said within myself for i perceiv
the vigour of my leg wa put in truce
we at the point were where no more ascend
the stairwai upward and were motionless
even as a ship which at the shore arriv
and i gave heed a littl if i might hear
aught whatsoev in the circl new
then to my master turn me round and said
sai my sweet father what delinqu
is purg here in the circl where we ar
although our feet mai paus paus not thy speech
and he to me the love of good remiss
in what it should have done is here restor
here pli again the illbel oar
but still more openli to understand
turn unto me thy mind and thou shalt gather
some profit fruit from our delai
neither creator nor a creatur ever
son he began wa destitut of love
natur or spiritu and thou knowest it
the natur wa ever without error
but err the other mai by evil object
or by too much or by too littl vigour
while in the first it well direct is
and in the second moder itself
it cannot be the caus of sin pleasur
but when to ill it turn and with more care
or lesser than it ought run after good
gainst the creator work hi own creation
henc thou mayst comprehend that love must be
the seed within yourselv of everi virtu
and everi act that merit punish
now inasmuch as never from the welfar
of it own subject can love turn it sight
from their own hatr all thing ar secur
and sinc we cannot think of ani be
stand alon nor from the first divid
of hate him is all desir cut off
henc if discrimin i judg well
the evil that on love is of on neighbour
and thi is born in three mode in your clai
there ar who by abas of their neighbour
hope to excel and therefor onli long
that from hi great he mai be cast down
there ar who power grace honour and renown
fear thei mai lose becaus anoth rise
thenc ar so sad that the revers thei love
and there ar those whom injuri seem to chafe
so that it make them greedi for reveng
and such must need shape out anoth harm
thi threefold love is wept for down below
now of the other will i have thee hear
that runneth after good with measur faulti
each on confusedli a good conceiv
wherein the mind mai rest and longeth for it
therefor to overtak it each on strive
if languid love to look on thi attract you
or in attain unto it thi cornic
after just penit torment you for it
there other good that doe not make man happi
ti not felic ti not the good
essenc of everi good the fruit and root
the love that yield itself too much to thi
abov us is lament in three circl
but how tripartit it mai be describ
i sai not that thou seek it for thyself
purgatorio canto xviii
an end had put unto hi reason
the lofti teacher and attent wa look
into my face if i appear content
and i whom a new thirst still goad on
without wa mute and said within perchanc
the too much question i make annoi him
but that true father who had comprehend
the timid wish that open not itself
by speak gave me hardihood to speak
whenc i my sight is master vivifi
so in thy light that clearli i discern
whateer thy speech importeth or describ
therefor i thee entreat sweet father dear
to teach me love to which thou dost refer
everi good action and it contrari
direct he said toward me the keen ey
of intellect and clear will be to thee
the error of the blind who would be leader
the soul which is creat apt to love
is mobil unto everyth that pleas
soon as by pleasur she is wake to action
your apprehens from some real thing
an imag draw and in yourselv displai it
so that it make the soul turn unto it
and if when turn toward it she inclin
love is that inclin it is natur
which is by pleasur bound in you anew
then even as the fire doth upward move
by it own form which to ascend is born
where longest in it matter it endur
so come the captiv soul into desir
which is a motion spiritu and neer rest
until she doth enjoi the thing belov
now mai appar be to thee how hidden
the truth is from those peopl who aver
all love is in itself a laudabl thing
becaus it matter mai perchanc appear
ay to be good but yet not each impress
is good albeit good mai be the wax
thy word and my sequaci intellect
i answer him have love reveal to me
but that ha made me more impregn with doubt
for if love from without be offer us
and with anoth foot the soul go not
if right or wrong she go ti not her merit
and he to me what reason seeth here
myself can tell thee beyond that await
for beatric sinc ti a work of faith
everi substanti form that segreg
from matter is and with it is unit
specif power ha in itself collect
which without act is not percept
nor show itself except by it effect
as life doe in a plant by the green leav
but still whenc cometh the intellig
of the first notion man is ignor
and the affect for the first allur
which ar in you as instinct in the bee
to make it honei and thi first desir
merit of prais or blame containeth not
now that to thi all other mai be gather
innat within you is the power that counsel
and it should keep the threshold of assent
thi is the principl from which is taken
occas of desert in you accord
as good and guilti love it take and winnow
those who in reason to the bottom went
were of thi innat liberti awar
therefor bequeath thei ethic to the world
suppos then that from necess
spring everi love that is within you kindl
within yourselv the power is to restrain it
the nobl virtu beatric understand
by the free will and therefor see that thou
bear it in mind if she should speak of it
the moon belat almost unto midnight
now made the star appear to us more rare
form like a bucket that is all ablaz
and counter to the heaven ran through those path
which the sun set aflam when he of rome
see it twixt sard and corsican go down
and that patrician shade for whom is name
pietola more than ani mantuan town
had laid asid the burden of my lade
whenc i who reason manifest and plain
in answer to my question had receiv
stood like a man in drowsi reveri
but taken from me wa thi drowsi
suddenli by a peopl that behind
our back alreadi had come round to us
and as of old ismenu and asopu
besid them saw at night the rush and throng
if but the theban were in need of bacchu
so thei along that circl curv their step
from what i saw of those approach us
who by goodwil and righteou love ar ridden
full soon thei were upon us becaus run
move onward all that mighti multitud
and two in the advanc cri out lament
mari in hast unto the mountain ran
and caesar that he might subdu ilerda
thrust at marseil and then ran into spain
quick quick so that the time mai not be lost
by littl love forthwith the other cri

so tell us where the passag nearest is
these were the word of him who wa my guid

so full of long ar we to move onward
that stai we cannot therefor pardon us
if thou for churlish our justic take
i wa san zeno abbot at verona

of whom still sorrow milan hold discours
and he ha on foot in the grave alreadi
who shall erelong lament that monasteri

becaus hi son in hi whole bodi sick
and wors in mind and who wa evilborn
he put into the place of it true pastor
if more he said or silent wa i know not
he had alreadi pass so far beyond us
but thi i heard and to retain it pleas me
and he who wa in everi need my succour
said turn thee hitherward see two of them
come fasten upon sloth their teeth
in rear of all thei shout sooner were

and those who the fatigu did not endur

then when from us so separ were
those shade that thei no longer could be seen
within me a new thought did entranc find
whenc other mani and divers were born
and so i laps from on into anoth
that in a reveri mine ey i close
and medit into dream transmut
purgatorio canto xix
it wa the hour when the diurnal heat
no more can warm the cold of the moon
vanquish by earth or peradventur saturn
when geomanc their fortuna major
see in the orient befor the dawn
rise by a path that long remain not dim
there came to me in dream a stammer woman
squint in her ey and in her feet distort
with hand dissev and of sallow hue
i look at her and as the sun restor
the frigid member which the night benumb
even thu my gaze did render volubl
her tongu and made her all erect thereaft
in littl while and the lost counten
as love desir it so in her did colour
when in thi wise she had her speech unloos
she gan to sing so that with difficulti
could i have turn my thought awai from her
i am she sang i am the siren sweet
who marin amid the main unman
so full am i of pleasant to hear
i drew ulyss from hi wander wai
unto my song and he who dwell with me
seldom depart so wholli i content him
her mouth wa not yet close again befor
appear a ladi saintli and alert
close at my side to put her to confus
virgiliu o virgiliu who is thi
sternli she said and he wa draw near
with ey still fix upon that modest on
she seiz the other and in front laid open
rend her garment and her belli show me
thi wake me with the stench that issu from it
i turn mine ey and good virgiliu said
at least thrice have i call thee rise and come
find we the open by which thou mayst enter
i rose and full alreadi of high dai
were all the circl of the sacr mountain
and with the new sun at our back we went
follow behind him i my forehead bore
like unto on who ha it laden with thought
who make himself the half arch of a bridg
when i heard sai come here the passag is
spoken in a manner gentl and benign
such as we hear not in thi mortal region
with open wing which of a swan appear
upward he turn us who thu spake to us
between the two wall of the solid granit
he move hi pinion afterward and fan us
affirm those qui lugent to be bless
for thei shall have their soul with comfort fill
what aileth thee that ay to earth thou gazest
to me my guid began to sai we both
somewhat beyond the angel have mount
and i with such misgiv make me go
a vision new which bend me to itself
so that i cannot from the thought withdraw me
didst thou behold he said that old enchantress
who sole abov us henceforth is lament
didst thou behold how man is freed from her
suffic it thee and smite earth with thy heel
thine ey lift upward to the lure that whirl
the etern king with revolut vast
even as the hawk that first hi feet survei
then turn him to the call and stretch forward
through the desir of food that draw him thither
such i becam and such as far as cleav
the rock to give a wai to him who mount
went on to where the circl doth begin
on the fifth circl when i had come forth
peopl i saw upon it who were weep
stretch prone upon the ground all downward turn
adhaesit pavimento anima mea
i heard them sai with sigh so profound
that hardli could the word be understood
o ye elect of god whose suffer
justic and hope both render less sever
direct ye us toward the high ascent
if ye ar come secur from thi prostrat
and wish to find the wai most speedili
let your right hand be evermor outsid
thu did the poet ask and thu wa answer
by them somewhat in front of us whenc i
in what wa spoken divin the rest conceal
and unto my lord ey mine ey i turn
whenc he assent with a cheer sign
to what the sight of my desir implor
when of myself i could dispos at will
abov that creatur did i draw myself
whose word befor had caus me to take note
sai o spirit in whom weep ripen
that without which to god we cannot turn
suspend awhil for me thy greater care
who wast thou and why ar your back turn upward
tell me and if thou wouldst that i procur thee
anyth there whenc live i depart
and he to me wherefor our back the heaven
turn to itself know shalt thou but beforehand
scia quod ego fui successor petri
between siestri and chiaveri descend
a river beauti and of it name
the titl of my blood it summit make
a month and littl more essai i how
weigh the great cloak on him from mire who keep it
for all the other burden seem a feather
tardi ah woe is me wa my convers
but when the roman shepherd i wa made
then i discov life to be a lie
i saw that there the heart wa not at rest
nor farther in that life could on ascend
wherebi the love of thi wa kindl in me
until that time a wretch soul and part
from god wa i and wholli avarici
now as thou seest i here am punish for it
what avaric doe is here made manifest
in the purgat of these soul convert
and no more bitter pain the mountain ha
even as our ey did not uplift itself
aloft be fasten upon earthli thing
so justic here ha merg it in the earth
as avaric had extinguish our affect
for everi good wherebi wa action lost
so justic here doth hold us in restraint
bound and imprison by the feet and hand
and so long as it pleas the just lord
shall we remain immov and prostrat
i on my knee had fallen and wish to speak
but even as i began and he wa ware
onli by listen of my rever
what caus he said ha downward bent thee thu
and i to him for your own digniti
stand my conscienc stung me with remors
straighten thy leg and upward rais thee brother
he answer err not fellowserv am i
with thee and with the other to on power
if eer that holi evangel sound
which sayeth nequ nubent thou hast heard
well canst thou see why in thi wise i speak
now go no longer will i have thee linger
becaus thy stai doth incommod my weep
with which i ripen that which thou hast said
on earth i have a grandchild name alagia
good in herself unless inde our hous
malevol mai make her by exampl
and she alon remain to me on earth
purgatorio canto xx
ill strive the will against a better will
therefor to pleasur him against my pleasur
i drew the spong not satur from the water
onward i move and onward move my leader
through vacant place skirt still the rock
as on a wall close to the battlement
for thei that through their ey pour drop by drop
the maladi which all the world pervad
on the other side too near the verg approach
accurs mayst thou be thou old shewolf
that more than all the other beast hast prei
becaus of hunger infinit hollow
o heaven in whose gyrat some appear
to think condit here below ar chang
when will he come through whom she shall depart
onward we went with footstep slow and scarc
and i attent to the shade i heard
piteous weep and bemoan them
and i by peradventur heard sweet mari
utter in front of us amid the weep
even as a woman doe who is in childbirth
and in continu how poor thou wast
is manifest by that hostelri
where thou didst lai thy sacr burden down
thereafterward i heard o good fabriciu
virtu with poverti didst thou prefer
to the possess of great wealth with vice
so pleasur were these word to me
that i drew farther onward to have knowledg
touch that spirit whenc thei seem to come
he furthermor wa speak of the largess
which nichola unto the maiden gave
in order to conduct their youth to honour
o soul that dost so excel speak
tell me who wast thou said i and why onli
thou dost renew these prais well deserv
not without recompens shall be thy word
if i return to finish the short journei
of that life which is fly to it end
and he ill tell thee not for ani comfort
i mai expect from earth but that so much
grace shine in thee or ever thou art dead
i wa the root of that malign plant
which overshadow all the christian world
so that good fruit is seldom gather from it
but if douai and ghent and lill and bruge
had power soon vengeanc would be taken on it
and thi i prai of him who judg all
hugh capet wa i call upon the earth
from me were born the louis and philip
by whom in later dai ha franc been govern
i wa the son of a parisian butcher
what time the ancient king had perish all
except on contrit in cloth of grai
i found me grasp in my hand the rein
of the realm govern and so great power
of new acquest and so with friend abound
that to the widow diadem promot
the head of mine own offspr wa from whom
the consecr bone of these began
so long as the great dowri of provenc
out of my blood took not the sens of shame
twa littl worth but still it did no harm
then it began with falsehood and with forc
it rapin and thereaft for amend
took ponthieu normandi and gasconi
charl came to itali and for amend
a victim made of conradin and then
thrust thoma back to heaven for amend
a time i see not veri distant now
which draweth forth anoth charl from franc
the better to make known both him and hi
unarm he goe and onli with the lanc
that juda joust with and that he thrust
so that he make the paunch of florenc burst
he thenc not land but sin and infami
shall gain so much more grievou to himself
as the more light such damag he account
the other now gone forth taen in hi ship
see i hi daughter sell and chaffer for her
as corsair do with other femal slave
what more o avaric canst thou do to us
sinc thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn
it careth not for it own proper flesh
that less mai seem the futur ill and past
i see the flowerdeluc alagna enter
and christ in hi own vicar captiv made
i see him yet anoth time derid
i see renew the vinegar and gall
and between live thiev i see him slain
i see the modern pilat so relentless
thi doe not sate him but without decret
he to the templ bear hi sordid sail
when o my lord shall i be joy made
by look on the vengeanc which conceal
make sweet thine anger in thy secreci
what i wa sai of that onli bride
of the holi ghost and which occas thee
to turn toward me for some commentari
so long ha been ordain to all our prayer
as the dai last but when the night come on
contrari sound we take instead thereof
at that time we repeat pygmalion
of whom a traitor thief and parricid
made hi insati desir of gold
and the miseri of avarici mida
that follow hi inordin demand
at which forevermor on need but laugh
the foolish achan each on then record
and how he stole the spoil so that the wrath
of joshua still appear to sting him here
then we accus sapphira with her husband
we laud the hoofbeat heliodoru had
and the whole mount in infami encircl
polymnestor who murder polydoru
here final is cri o crassu tell us
for thou dost know what is the tast of gold
sometim we speak on loud anoth low
accord to desir of speech that spur us
to greater now and now to lesser pace
but in the good that here by dai is talk of
erewhil alon i wa not yet near by
no other person lift up hi voic
from him alreadi we depart were
and made endeavour to oercom the road
as much as wa permit to our power
when i perceiv like someth that is fall
the mountain trembl whenc a chill seiz on me
as seiz him who to hi death is go
cert so violent shook not delo
befor latona made her nest therein
to give birth to the two ey of the heaven
then upon all side there began a cry
such that the master drew himself toward me
sai fear not while i am guid thee
gloria in excelsi deo all
were sai from what near i comprehend
where it wa possibl to hear the cry
we paus immov and in suspens
even as the shepherd who first heard that song
until the trembl ceas and it wa finish
then we resum again our holi path
watch the shade that lai upon the ground
alreadi turn to their accustom plaint
no ignor ever with so great a strife
had render me importun to know
if erreth not in thi my memori
as medit then i seem to have
nor out of hast to question did i dare
nor of myself i there could aught perceiv
so i went onward timor and thought
purgatorio canto xxi
the natur thirst that neer is satisfi
except with the water for whose grace
the woman of samaria besought
put me in travail and hast goad me
along the encumb path behind my leader
and i wa piti that righteou vengeanc
and lo in the same manner as luke writeth
that christ appear to two upon the wai
from the sepulchr cave alreadi risen
a shade appear to us and came behind us
down gaze on the prostrat multitud
nor were we ware of it until it spake
sai my brother mai god give you peac
we turn us suddenli and virgiliu render
to him the countersign thereto conform
thereon began he in the bless council
thee mai the court veraci place in peac
that me doth banish in etern exil
how said he and the while we went with speed
if ye ar shade whom god deign not on high
who up hi stair so far ha guid you
and said my teacher if thou note the mark
which thi on bear and which the angel trace
well shalt thou see he with the good must reign
but becaus she who spinneth dai and night
for him had not yet drawn the distaff off
which clotho lai for each on and compact
hi soul which is thy sister and my own
in come upward could not come alon
by reason that it see not in our fashion
whenc i wa drawn from out the ampl throat
of hell to be hi guid and i shall guid him
as far on as my school ha power to lead
but tell us if thou knowest why such a shudder
erewhil the mountain gave and why togeth
all seem to cry as far as it moist feet
in ask he so hit the veri ey
of my desir that mere with the hope
my thirst becam the less unsatisfi
naught is there he began that without order
mai the religion of the mountain feel
nor aught that mai be foreign to it custom
free is it here from everi permut
what from itself heaven in itself receiveth
can be of thi the caus and naught besid
becaus that neither rain nor hail nor snow
nor dew nor hoarfrost ani higher fall
than the short littl stairwai of three step
dens cloud do not appear nor rarefi
nor corusc nor the daughter of thauma
that often upon earth her region shift
no arid vapour ani farther rise
than to the top of the three step i spake of
whereon the vicar of peter ha hi feet
lower down perchanc it trembl less or more
but for the wind that in the earth is hidden
i know not how up here it never trembl
it trembl here whenev ani soul
feel itself pure so that it soar or move
to mount aloft and such a cry attend it
of puriti the will alon give proof
which be wholli free to chang it convent
take by surpris the soul and help it fly
first it will well but the desir permit not
which divin justic with the selfsam will
there wa to sin upon the torment set
and i who have been ly in thi pain
five hundr year and more but just now felt
a free volit for a better seat
therefor thou heardst the earthquak and the piou
spirit along the mountain render prais
unto the lord that soon he speed them upward
so said he to him and sinc we enjoi
as much in drink as the thirst is great
i could not sai how much it did me good
and the wise leader now i see the net
that snare you here and how ye ar set free
why the earth quak and wherefor ye rejoic
now who thou wast be pleas that i mai know
and why so mani centuri thou hast here
been ly let me gather from thy word
in dai when the good titu with the aid
of the supremest king aveng the wound
whenc issu forth the blood by juda sold
under the name that most endur and honour
wa i on earth that spirit made repli
greatli renown but not with faith as yet
my vocal spirit wa so sweet that rome
me a thoulousian drew unto herself
where i deserv to deck my brow with myrtl
statiu the peopl name me still on earth
i sang of thebe and then of great achil
but on the wai fell with my second burden
the seed unto my ardour were the spark
of that celesti flame which heat me
wherebi more than a thousand have been fire
of the aeneid speak i which to me
a mother wa and wa my nurs in song
without thi weigh i not a drachma weight
and to have live upon the earth what time
virgiliu live i would accept on sun
more than i must er issu from my ban
these word toward me made virgiliu turn
with look that in their silenc said be silent
but yet the power that will cannot do all thing
for tear and laughter ar such pursuiv
unto the passion from which each spring forth
in the most truth least the will thei follow
i onli smile as on who give the wink
whereat the shade wa silent and it gaze
into mine ey where most express dwell
and as thou well mayst consumm a labour
so great it said why did thy face just now
displai to me the lightn of a smile
now am i caught on thi side and on that
on keep me silent on to speak conjur me
wherefor i sigh and i am understood
speak said my master and be not afraid
of speak but speak out and sai to him
what he demand with such solicitud
whenc i thou peradventur marvellest
o antiqu spirit at the smile i gave
but i will have more wonder seiz upon thee
thi on who guid on high these ey of mine
is that virgiliu from whom thou didst learn
to sing aloud of men and of the god
if other caus thou to my smile imputedst
abandon it as fals and trust it wa
those word which thou hast spoken concern him
alreadi he wa stoop to embrac
my teacher feet but he said to him brother
do not for shade thou art and shade beholdest
and he upris now canst thou the sum
of love which warm me to thee comprehend
when thi our vaniti i disrememb
treat a shadow as substanti thing
purgatorio canto xxii
alreadi wa the angel left behind us
the angel who to the sixth round had turn us
have eras on mark from off my face
and those who have in justic their desir
had said to us beati in their voic
with sitio and without more end it
and i more light than through the other pass
went onward so that without ani labour
i follow upward the swiftfoot spirit
when thu virgiliu began the love
kindl by virtu ay anoth kindl
provid outwardli it flame appear
henc from the hour that juven descend
among us into the infern limbo
who made appar to me thy affect
my kindli toward thee wa as great
as ever bound on to an unseen person
so that these stair will now seem short to me
but tell me and forgiv me as a friend
if too great confid let loos the rein
and as a friend now hold discours with me
how wa it possibl within thy breast
for avaric to find place mid so much wisdom
as thou wast fill with by thy dilig
these word excit statiu at first
somewhat to laughter afterward he answer
each word of thine is love dear sign to me
verili oftentim do thing appear
which give fallaci matter to our doubt
instead of the true caus which ar hidden
thy question show me thy belief to be
that i wa niggard in the other life
it mai be from the circl where i wa
therefor know thou that avaric wa remov
too far from me and thi extravag
thousand of lunar period have punish
and were it not that i my thought uplift
when i the passag heard where thou exclaimest
as if indign unto human natur
to what impellest thou not o curs hunger
of gold the appetit of mortal men
revolv i should feel the dismal joust
then i perceiv the hand could spread too wide
their wing in spend and repent me
as well of that as of my other sin
how mani with shorn hair shall rise again
becaus of ignor which from thi sin
cut off repent live and in death
and know that the transgress which rebut
by direct opposit ani sin
togeth with it here it verdur dri
therefor if i have been among that folk
which mourn it avaric to purifi me
for it opposit ha thi befallen me
now when thou sangest the relentless weapon
of the twofold afflict of jocasta
the singer of the song bucol said
from that which clio there with thee prelud
it doe not seem that yet had made thee faith
that faith without which no good work suffic
if thi be so what candl or what sun
scatter thy dark so that thou didst trim
thy sail behind the fisherman thereaft
and he to him thou first directedst me
toward parnassu in it grot to drink
and first concern god didst me enlighten
thou didst as he who walketh in the night
who bear hi light behind which help him not
but wari make the person after him
when thou didst sai the ag renew itself
justic return and man primev time
and a new progeni descend from heaven
through thee i poet wa through thee a christian
but that thou better see what i design
to colour it will i extend my hand
alreadi wa the world in everi part
pregnant with the true creed dissemin
by messeng of the etern kingdom
and thy assert spoken of abov
with the new preacher wa in unison
whenc i to visit them the custom took
then thei becam so holi in my sight
that when domitian persecut them
not without tear of mine were their lament
and all the while that i on earth remain
them i befriend and their upright custom
made me disparag all the other sect
and er i led the greek unto the river
of thebe in poetri i wa baptiz
but out of fear wa covertli a christian
for a long time profess pagan
and thi lukewarm caus me the fourth circl
to circuit round more than four centuri
thou therefor who hast rais the cover
that hid from me whatev good i speak of
while in ascend we have time to spare
tell me in what place is our friend terentiu
caeciliu plautu varro if thou knowest
tell me if thei ar damn and in what allei
these persiu and myself and other mani
repli my leader with that grecian ar
whom more than all the rest the muse suckl
in the first circl of the prison blind
ofttim we of the mountain hold discours
which ha our nurs ever with itself
euripid is with us antiphon
simonid agatho and mani other
greek who of old their brow with laurel deck
there some of thine own peopl mai be seen
antigon deiphil and argia
and there ismen mourn as of old
there she is seen who point out langia
there is tiresia daughter and there theti
and there deidamia with her sister
silent alreadi were the poet both
attent onc more in look round about
from the ascent and from the wall releas
and four handmaiden of the dai alreadi
were left behind and at the pole the fifth
wa point upward still it burn horn
what time my guid i think that towrd the edg
our dexter shoulder it behov us turn
circl the mount as we ar wont to do
thu in that region custom wa our ensign
and we resum our wai with less suspicion
for the assent of that worthi soul
thei in advanc went on and i alon
behind them and i listen to their speech
which gave me lesson in the art of song
but soon their sweet discours interrupt
a tree which midwai in the road we found
with appl sweet and grate to the smell
and even as a firtre taper upward
from bough to bough so downwardli did that
i think in order that no on might climb it
on that side where our pathwai wa enclos
fell from the lofti rock a limpid water
and spread itself abroad upon the leav
the poet twain unto the tree drew near
and from among the foliag a voic
cri of thi food ye shall have scarciti
then said more thought mari wa of make
the marriag feast complet and honour
than of her mouth which now for you respond
and for their drink the ancient roman women
with water were content and daniel
disparag food and understand won
the primal ag wa beauti as gold
acorn it made with hunger savor
and nectar everi rivulet with thirst
honei and locust were the aliment
that fed the baptist in the wilder
whenc he is gloriou and so magnifi
as by the evangel is reveal to you
purgatorio canto xxiii
the while among the verdant leav mine ey
i rivet as he is wont to do
who wast hi life pursu littl bird
my more than father said unto me son
come now becaus the time that is ordain us
more usefulli should be apport out
i turn my face and no less soon my step
unto the sage who were speak so
thei made the go of no cost to me
and lo were heard a song and a lament
labia mea domin in fashion
such that delight and dolenc it brought forth
o my sweet father what is thi i hear
began i and he answer shade that go
perhap the knot unloos of their debt
in the same wai that thought pilgrim do
who unknown peopl on the road oertak
turn themselv round to them and do not stop
even thu behind us with a swifter motion
come and pass onward gaze upon us
a crowd of spirit silent and devout
each in hi ey wa dark and cavern
pallid in face and so emaci
that from the bone the skin did shape itself
i do not think that so to merest rind
could erisichthon have been wither up
by famin when most fear he had of it
think within myself i said behold
thi is the folk who lost jerusalem
when mari made a prei of her own son
their socket were like ring without the gem
whoever in the face of men read omo
might well in these have recognis the m
who would believ the odour of an appl
beget long could consum them so
and that of water without know how
i still wa wonder what so famish them
for the occas not yet manifest
of their emaci and sad squalor
and lo from out the hollow of hi head
hi ey a shade turn on me and look keenli
then cri aloud what grace to me is thi
never should i have known him by hi look
but in hi voic wa evid to me
that which hi aspect had suppress within it
thi spark within me wholli reenkindl
my recognit of hi alter face
and i recal the featur of fores
ah do not look at thi dry leprosi
entreat he which doth my skin discolour
nor at default of flesh that i mai have
but tell me truth of thee and who ar those
two soul that yonder make for thee an escort
do not delai in speak unto me
that face of thine which dead i onc bewept
give me for weep now no lesser grief
i answer him behold it so chang
but tell me for god sake what thu denud you
make me not speak while i am marvel
for ill speak he who full of other long
and he to me from the etern council
fall power into the water and the tree
behind us left wherebi i grow so thin
all of thi peopl who lament sing
for follow beyond measur appetit
in hunger and thirst ar here resanctifi
desir to eat and drink enkindl in us
the scent that issu from the appletre
and from the sprai that sprinkl oer the verdur
and not a singl time alon thi ground
encompass is refresh our pain
i sai our pain and ought to sai our solac
for the same wish doth lead us to the tree
which led the christ rejoic to sai eli
when with hi vein he liber us
and i to him fores from that dai
when for a better life thou changedst world
up to thi time five year have not roll round
if sooner were the power exhaust in thee
of sin more than thee the hour surpris
of that good sorrow which to god rew us
how hast thou come up hitherward alreadi
i thought to find thee down there underneath
where time for time doth restitut make
and he to me thu speedili ha led me
to drink of the sweet wormwood of these torment
my nella with her overflow tear
she with her prayer devout and with her sigh
ha drawn me from the coast where on where on await
and from the other circl set me free
so much more dear and pleas is to god
my littl widow whom so much i love
as in good work she is the more alon
for the barbagia of sardinia
by far more modest in it women is
than the barbagia i have left her in
o brother sweet what wilt thou have me sai
a futur time is in my sight alreadi
to which thi hour will not be veri old
when from the pulpit shall be interdict
to the unblush womankind of florenc
to go about displai breast and pap
what savag were eer what saracen
who stood in need to make them cover go
of spiritu or other disciplin
but if the shameless women were assur
of what swift heaven prepar for them alreadi
wide open would thei have their mouth to howl
for if my foresight here deceiv me not
thei shall be sad er he ha beard cheek
who now is hush to sleep with lullabi
o brother now no longer hide thee from me
see that not onli i but all these peopl
ar gaze there where thou dost veil the sun
whenc i to him if thou bring back to mind
what thou with me hast been and i with thee
the present memori will be grievou still
out of that life he turn me back who goe
in front of me two dai agon when round
the sister of him yonder show herself
and to the sun i point through the deep
night of the truli dead ha thi on led me
with thi true flesh that follow after him
thenc hi encourag have led me up
ascend and still circl round the mount
that you doth straighten whom the world made crook
he sai that he will bear me compani
till i shall be where beatric will be
there it behov me to remain without him
thi is virgiliu who thu sai to me
and him i point at the other is

on more than other did i him of lucca
who seem to take most cogniz of me
he murmur and i know not what gentucca
from that place heard i where he felt the wound
of justic that doth macer them so
o soul i said that seemest so desir
to speak with me do so that i mai hear thee
and with thy speech appeas thyself and me
a maid is born and wear not yet the veil
began he who to thee shall pleasant make
my citi howsoev men mai blame it
thou shalt go on thy wai with thi previs
if by my murmur thou hast been deceiv
true thing hereaft will declar it to thee
but sai if him i here behold who forth
evok the newinv rhyme begin
ladi that have intellig of love
and i to him on am i who whenev
love doth inspir me note and in that measur
which he within me dictat sing go
o brother now i see he said the knot
which me the notari and guitton held
short of the sweet new style that now i hear
i do perceiv full clearli how your pen
go close follow after him who dictat
which with our own forsooth came not to pass
and he who set himself to go beyond
no differ see from on style to anoth
and as if satisfi he held hi peac
even as the bird that winter towrd the nile
sometim into a phalanx form themselv
then fly in greater hast and go in file
in such wise all the peopl who were there
turn their face hurri on their step
both by their lean and their wish light
and as a man who weari is with trot
let hi companion onward go and walk
until he vent the pant of hi chest
so did fores let the holi flock
pass by and came with me behind it sai
when will it be that i again shall see thee
how long i answer i mai live i know not
yet my return will not so speedi be
but i shall sooner in desir arriv
becaus the place where i wa set to live
from dai to dai of good is more deplet
and unto dismal ruin seem ordain
now go he said for him most guilti of it
at a beast tail behold i drag along
toward the vallei where is no repent
faster at everi step the beast is go
increas evermor until it smite him
and leav the bodi vile mutil
not long those wheel shall turn and he uplift
hi ey to heaven er shall be clear to thee
that which my speech no farther can declar
now stai behind becaus the time so preciou
is in thi kingdom that i lose too much
by come onward thu abreast with thee
as sometim issu forth upon a gallop
a cavali from out a troop that ride
and seek the honour of the first encount
so he with greater stride depart from us
and on the road remain i with those two
who were such mighti marshal of the world
and when befor us he had gone so far
mine ey becam to him such pursuiv
as wa my understand to hi word
appear to me with laden and live bough
anoth appletre and not far distant
from have but just then turn thitherward
peopl i saw beneath it lift their hand
and cry i know not what toward the leav
like littl children eager and delud
who prai and he thei prai to doth not answer
but to make veri keen their appetit
hold their desir aloft and hide it not
then thei depart as if undeceiv
and now we came unto the mighti tree
which prayer and tear so manifold refus
pass farther onward without draw near
the tree of which ev at is higher up
and out of that on ha thi tree been rais
thu said i know not who among the branch
whereat virgiliu statiu and myself
went crowd forward on the side that rise
be mind said he of the accurs on
form of the cloudrack who inebri
combat theseu with their doubl breast
and of the jew who show them soft in drink
whenc gideon would not have them for companion
when he towrd midian the hill descend
thu close press to on of the two border
on pass we hear sin of gluttoni
follow forsooth by miser gain
then set at larg upon the lone road
a thousand step and more we onward went
in contempl each without a word
what go ye think thu ye three alon
said suddenli a voic whereat i start
as terrifi and timid beast ar wont
i rais my head to see who thi might be
and never in a furnac wa there seen
metal or glass so lucent and so red
as on i saw who said if it mai pleas you
to mount aloft here it behov you turn
thi wai goe he who goeth after peac
hi aspect had bereft me of my sight
so that i turn me back unto my teacher
like on who goeth as hi hear guid him
and as the harbing of earli dawn
the air of mai doth move and breath out fragranc
impregn all with herbag and with flower
so did i feel a breez strike in the midst
my front and felt the move of the plume
that breath around an odour of ambrosia
and heard it said bless ar thei whom grace
so much illumin that the love of tast
excit not in their breast too great desir
hunger at all time so far as is just
purgatorio canto xxv
now wa it the ascent no hindranc brook
becaus the sun had hi meridian circl
to tauru left and night to scorpio
wherefor as doth a man who tarri not
but goe hi wai whateer to him appear
if of necess the sting transfix him
in thi wise did we enter through the gap
take the stairwai on befor the other
which by it narrow divid the climber
and as the littl stork that lift it wing
with a desir to fly and doe not ventur
to leav the nest and let it downward droop
even such wa i with the desir of ask
kindl and quench unto the motion come
he make who doth address himself to speak
not for our pace though rapid it might be
my father sweet forbor but said let fly
the bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn
with confid i open then my mouth
and i began how can on meagr grow
there where the need of nutriment appli not
if thou wouldst call to mind how meleag
wa wast by the wast of a brand
thi would not said he be to thee so sour
and wouldst thou think how at each tremul motion
trembl within a mirror your own imag
that which seem hard would mellow seem to thee
but that thou mayst content thee in thy wish
lo statiu here and him i call and prai
he now will be the healer of thy wound
if i unfold to him the etern vengeanc
respond statiu where thou present art
be my excus that i can naught deni thee
then he began son if these word of mine
thy mind doth contempl and doth receiv
theyll be thy light unto the how thou sayest
the perfect blood which never is drunk up
into the thirsti vein and which remaineth
like food that from the tabl thou removest
take in the heart for all the human member
virtu inform as be that
which to be chang to them goe through the vein
again digest descend it where ti better
silent to be than sai and then drop thenc
upon anoth blood in natur vase
there on togeth with the other mingl
on to be passiv meant the other activ
by reason of the perfect place it spring from

coagul first then vivifi
what for it matter it had made consist

as of a plant in so far differ
thi on the wai is that arriv alreadi
then work so much that now it move and feel
like a seafungu and then undertak
to organ the power whose seed it is
now son dilat and now distend itself
the virtu from the gener heart
where natur is intent on all the member
but how from anim it man becom
thou dost not see as yet thi is a point
which made a wiser man than thou onc err
so far that in hi doctrin separ
he made the soul from possibl intellect
for he no organ saw by thi assum
open thy breast unto the truth that come
and know that just as soon as in the foetu
the articul of the brain is perfect
the primal motor turn to it well pleas
at so great art of natur and inspir
a spirit new with virtu all replet
which what it find there activ doth attract
into it substanc and becom on soul
which live and feel and on itself revolv
and that thou less mai wonder at my word
behold the sun heat which becometh wine
join to the juic that from the vine distil
whenev lachesi ha no more thread
it separ from the flesh and virtual
bear with itself the human and divin
the other faculti ar voiceless all

without a paus it falleth of itself
in marvel wai on on shore or the other
there of it road it first is cogniz
soon as the place there circumscribeth it
the virtu inform rai round about

and even as the air when full of rain
by alien rai that ar therein reflect
with diver colour show itself adorn
so there the neighbour air doth shape itself
into that form which doth impress upon it
virtual the soul that ha stood still
and then in manner of the littl flame
which followeth the fire whereer it shift
after the spirit followeth it new form
sinc afterward it take from thi it semblanc
it is call shade and thenc it organ
thereaft everi sens even to the sight
thenc is it that we speak and thenc we laugh
thenc is it that we form the tear and sigh
that on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard
accord as impress us our desir
and other affect so the shade is shape
and thi is caus of what thou wonderest at
and now unto the last of all the circl
had we arriv and to the right hand turn
and were attent to anoth care
there the embank shoot forth flame of fire
and upward doth the cornic breath a blast
that drive them back and from itself sequest
henc we must need go on the open side
and on by on and i did fear the fire
on thi side and on that the fall down
my leader said along thi place on ought
to keep upon the ey a tighten rein
see that on so easili might err
summa deu clementia in the bosom
of the great burn chant then i heard
which made me no less eager to turn round
and spirit saw i walk through the flame
wherefor i look to my own step and their
apport my sight from time to time
after the close which to that hymn is made
aloud thei shout virum non cognosco
then recommenc the hymn with voic low
thi also end cri thei to the wood
diana ran and drove forth helic
therefrom who had of venu felt the poison
then to their song return thei then the wive
thei shout and the husband who were chast
as virtu and the marriag vow impos
and i believ that them thi mode suffic
for all the time the fire is burn them
with such care is it need and such food
that the last wound of all should be close up
purgatorio canto xxvi
while on the brink thu on befor the other
we went upon our wai oft the good master
said take thou heed suffic it that i warn thee
on the right shoulder smote me now the sun
that rai out alreadi the whole west
chang from it azur aspect into white

appear more red and even to such a sign
shade saw i mani as thei went give heed
thi wa the caus that gave them a begin

on other novelti that then appear
for through the middl of the burn road
there came a peopl face to face with these
which held me in suspens with gaze at them

each of the shade and kiss on anoth
without a paus content with brief salut

purgatorio canto xxvii
as when he vibrat forth hi earliest rai
in region where hi maker shed hi blood
the ebro fall under lofti libra
and water in the gang burnt with noon
so stood the sun henc wa the dai depart
when the glad angel of god appear to us
outsid the flame he stood upon the verg

then no on farther goe soul sanctifi
if first the fire bite not within it enter
and be not deaf unto the song beyond
when we were close besid him thu he said
wherefor een such becam i when i heard him
as he is who is put into the grave
upon my clasp hand i straighten me
scan the fire and vividli recal
the human bodi i had onc seen burn
toward me turn themselv my good conductor
and unto me virgiliu said my son
here mai inde be torment but not death
rememb thee rememb and if i

what shall i do now i am nearer god
believ for certain shouldst thou stand a full

it could not make thee bald a singl hair
and if perchanc thou think that i deceiv thee
draw near to it and put it to the proof
with thine own hand upon thy garment hem
now lai asid now lai asid all fear
turn hitherward and onward come secur
and i still motionless and gainst my conscienc
see me stand still motionless and stubborn
somewhat disturb he said now look thou son
twixt beatric and thee there is thi wall
as at the name of thisb op hi lid

even thu my obduraci be soften
i turn to my wise guid hear the name
that in my memori evermor is well
whereat he wag hi head and said how now
shall we stai on thi side then smile as on
doe at a child who vanquish by an appl
then into the fire in front of me he enter
beseech statiu to come after me
who a long wai befor divid us
when i wa in it into molten glass
i would have cast me to refresh myself
so without measur wa the burn there
and my sweet father to encourag me
discours still of beatric went on
sai her ey i seem to see alreadi
a voic that on the other side wa sing
direct us and we attent alon
on that came forth where the ascent began
venit benedicti patri mei
sound within a splendour which wa there
such it oercam me and i could not look
the sun depart it ad and night cometh
tarri ye not but onward urg your step
so long as yet the west becom not dark
straight forward through the rock the path ascend
in such a wai that i cut off the rai
befor me of the sun that now wa low
and of few stair we yet had made assai
er by the vanish shadow the sun set
behind us we perceiv i and my sage
and er in all it part immeasur
the horizon of on aspect had becom
and night her boundless dispens held
each of us of a stair had made hi bed
becaus the natur of the mount took from us
the power of climb more than the delight
even as in rumin passiv grow
the goat who have been swift and venturesom
upon the mountaintop er thei were fed
hush in the shadow while the sun is hot
watch by the herdsman who upon hi staff
is lean and in lean tendeth them
and as the shepherd lodg out of door
pass the night besid hi quiet flock
watch that no wild beast mai scatter it
such at that hour were we all three of us
i like the goat and like the herdsmen thei
begirt on thi side and on that by rock
littl could there be seen of thing without
but through that littl i beheld the star
more lumin and larger than their wont
thu rumin and behold these
sleep seiz upon mesleep that oftentim
befor a deed is done ha tide of it
it wa the hour i think when from the east
first on the mountain citherea beam
who with the fire of love seem alwai burn
youth and beauti in dream methought
i saw a ladi walk in a meadow
gather flower and sing she wa sai
know whosoev mai my name demand
that i am leah and go move round
my beauteou hand to make myself a garland
to pleas me at the mirror here i deck me
but never doe my sister rachel leav
her lookingglass and sitteth all dai long
to see her beauteou ey as eager is she
as i am to adorn me with my hand
her see and me do satisfi
and now befor the antelucan splendour
that unto pilgrim the more grate rise
as homereturn less remot thei lodg
the dark fled awai on everi side
and slumber with it whereupon i rose
see alreadi the great master risen
that appl sweet which through so mani branch
the care of mortal goeth in pursuit of
todai shall put in peac thy hunger
speak to me virgiliu of such word
as these made us and never were there guerdon
that could in pleasant compar with these
such long upon long came upon me
to be abov that at each step thereaft
for flight i felt in me the pinion grow
when underneath us wa the stairwai all
run oer and we were on the highest step
virgiliu fasten upon me hi ey
and said the tempor fire and the etern
son thou hast seen and to a place art come
where of myself no farther i discern
by intellect and art i here have brought thee
take thine own pleasur for thy guid henceforth
beyond the steep wai and the narrow art thou

behold the grass the floweret and the shrub

thou canst sit down and thou canst walk among them
expect no more or word or sign from me
free and upright and sound is thy freewil

a softlybreath air that no mutat

no heavier blow than of a gentl wind
whereat the branch lightli tremul
did all of them bow downward toward that side
where it first shadow cast the holi mountain

so that the littl bird upon their top
should leav the practic of each art of their

such as from branch to branch goe gather on
through the pine forest on the shore of chiassi
when eolu unloos the sirocco
alreadi my slow step had carri me
into the ancient wood so far that i
could not perceiv where i had enter it
and lo my further cours a stream cut off
which towrd the left hand with it littl wave
bent down the grass that on it margin sprang
all water that on earth most limpid ar
would seem to have within themselv some mixtur
compar with that which noth doth conceal
although it move on with a brown brown current
under the shade perpetu that never
rai of the sun let in nor of the moon
with feet i stai and with mine ey i pass
beyond the rivulet to look upon

near to thi river bank i said to her
so much that i might hear what thou art sing
thou makest me rememb where and what
proserpina that moment wa when lost
her mother her and she herself the spring
as turn herself with feet togeth press
and to the ground a ladi who is danc
and hardli put on foot befor the other
on the vermilion and the yellow floweret
she turn toward me not in other wise
than maiden who her modest ey cast down
and my entreati made to be content
so near approach that the dulcet sound
came unto me togeth with it mean
as soon as she wa where the grass ar
bath by the water of the beauteou river
to lift her ey she grant me the boon
i do not think there shone so great a light
under the lid of venu when transfix
by her own son beyond hi usual custom
erect upon the other bank she smile
bear full mani colour in her hand
which that high land produc without seed
apart three pace did the river make us
but hellespont where xerx pass across
a curb still to all human arrog
more hatr from leander did not suffer

which ha the power to uncloud your intellect
and thou who foremost art and didst entreat me
speak if thou wouldst hear more for i came readi
to all thy question as far as need

thi mount ascend towrd the heaven so high
and is exempt from there where it is lock
now sinc the univers atmospher

unless the circl is broken on some side
upon thi height that all is disengag
in live ether doth thi motion strike

and lo a sudden lustr ran across
on everi side athwart the spaciou forest
such that it made me doubt if it were lightn
but sinc the lightn ceas as it come

within my thought i said what thing is thi

becam the air beneath the verdant bough
and the sweet sound as sing now wa heard
o virgin sacrosanct if ever hunger

now helicon must need pour forth for me
and with her choir urania must assist me
to put in vers thing difficult to think
a littl farther on seven tree of gold

the common object which the sens deceiv
lost not by distanc ani of it mark

did apprehend that thei were candlestick

i turn me round with admir fill
to good virgiliu and he answer me
with visag no less full of wonder
then back i turn my face to those high thing
which move themselv toward us so sedat
thei had been distanc by newwed bride
the ladi chid me why dost thou burn onli
so with affect for the live light
and dost not look at what come after them
then saw i peopl as behind their leader
come behind them garment in white
and such a white never wa on earth
the water on my left flank wa resplend
and back to me reflect my left side
een as a mirror if i look therein
when i upon my margin had such post
that noth but the stream divid us
better to see i gave my step repos
and i beheld the flamelet onward go
leav behind themselv the air depict
and thei of trail pennon had the semblanc
so that it overhead remain distinct
with sevenfold list all of them of the colour
whenc the sun bow is made and delia girdl
these standard to the rearward longer were
than wa my sight and as it seem to me
ten pace were the outermost apart
under so fair a heaven as i describ
the four and twenti elder two by two
came on incoron with flowerdeluc
thei all of them were sing bless thou
among the daughter of adam art and bless
for evermor shall be thy loveli
after the flower and other tender grass
in front of me upon the other margin
were disencumb of that race elect
even as in heaven star followeth after star
there came close after them four anim
incoron each on with verdant leaf
plume with six wing wa everi on of them
the plumag full of ey the ey of argu
if thei were live would be such as these
reader to trace their form no more i wast
my rhyme for other spend press me so
that i in thi cannot be prodig
but read ezekiel who depicteth them
as he beheld them from the region cold
come with cloud with whirlwind and with fire
and such as thou shalt find them in hi page
such were thei here save that in their plumag
john is with me and differeth from him
the interv between these four contain
a chariot triumphal on two wheel
which by a griffin neck came drawn along
and upward he extend both hi wing
between the middl list and three and three
so that he injur none by cleav it
so high thei rose that thei were lost to sight
hi limb were gold so far as he wa bird
and white the other with vermilion mingl
not onli rome with no such splendid car
eer gladden africanu or augustu
but poor to it that of the sun would be
that of the sun which swerv wa burnt up
at the importun orison of earth
when jove wa so mysteri just
three maiden at the right wheel in a circl
came onward danc on so veri red
that in the fire she hardli had been note
the second wa as if her flesh and bone
had all been fashion out of emerald
the third appear as snow but newli fallen
and now thei seem conduct by the white
now by the red and from the song of her
the other took their step or slow or swift
upon the left hand four made holidai
vest in purpl follow the measur
of on of them with three ey in her head
in rear of all the group here treat of
two old men i beheld unlik in habit
but like in gait each dignifi and grave
on show himself as on of the discipl
of that suprem hippocr whom natur
made for the anim she hold most dear
contrari care the other manifest
with sword so shine and so sharp it caus
terror to me on thi side of the river
thereaft four i saw of humbl aspect
and behind all an ag man alon
walk in sleep with counten acut
and like the foremost compani these seven
were habit yet of the flowerdeluc
no garland round about the head thei wore
but of the rose and other flower vermilion
at littl distanc would the sight have sworn
that all were in a flame abov their brow
and when the car wa opposit to me
thunder wa heard and all that folk august
seem to have further progress interdict
there with the vanward ensign stand still
purgatorio canto xxx
when the septentrion of the highest heaven
which never either set knew or rise
nor veil of other cloud than that of sin
and which made everi on therein awar
of hi own duti as the lower make
whoever turn the helm to come to port
motionless halt the veraci peopl
that came at first between it and the griffin
turn themselv to the car as to their peac
and on of them as if by heaven commiss
sing veni sponsa de libano
shout three time and all the other after
even as the bless at the final summon
shall rise up quicken each on from hi cavern
uplift light the reinvest flesh
so upon that celesti chariot
a hundr rose ad vocem tanti seni
minist and messeng of life etern
thei all were sai benedictu qui veni
and scatter flower abov and round about
manibu o date lilia pleni
er now have i beheld as dai began
the eastern hemispher all ting with rose
and the other heaven with fair seren adorn
and the sun face upris overshadow
so that by temper influenc of vapour
for a long interv the ey sustain it
thu in the bosom of a cloud of flower
which from those hand angel ascend
and downward fell again insid and out
over her snowwhit veil with oliv cinct
appear a ladi under a green mantl
vest in colour of the live flame
and my own spirit that alreadi now
so long a time had been that in her presenc
trembl with aw it had not stood abash
without more knowledg have by mine ey
through occult virtu that from her proceed
of ancient love the mighti influenc felt
as soon as on my vision smote the power
sublim that had alreadi pierc me through
er from my boyhood i had yet come forth
to the left hand i turn with that relianc
with which the littl child run to hi mother
when he ha fear or when he is afflict
to sai unto virgiliu not a drachm
of blood remain in me that doe not trembl
i know the trace of the ancient flame
but us virgiliu of himself depriv
had left virgiliu sweetest of all father
virgiliu to whom i for safeti gave me
nor whatsoev lost the ancient mother
avail my cheek now purifi from dew
that weep thei should not again be darken
dant becaus virgiliu ha depart
do not weep yet do not weep yet awhil
for by anoth sword thou needst must weep
een as an admir who on poop and prow
come to behold the peopl that ar work
in other ship and cheer them to welldo
upon the left hand border of the car
when at the sound i turn of my own name
which of necess is here record
i saw the ladi who erewhil appear
veil underneath the angel festiv
direct her ey to me across the river
although the veil that from her head descend
encircl with the foliag of minerva
did not permit her to appear distinctli
in attitud still royal majest
continu she like unto on who speak
and keep hi warmest utter in reserv
look at me well in sooth im beatric
how didst thou deign to come unto the mountain
didst thou not know that man is happi here
mine ey fell downward into the clear fountain
but see myself therein i sought the grass
so great a shame did weigh my forehead down
as to the son the mother seem superb
so she appear to me for somewhat bitter
tasteth the savour of sever compass
silent becam she and the angel sang
suddenli in te domin speravi
but beyond pede meo did not pass
even as the snow among the live rafter
upon the back of itali congeal
blown on and drift by sclavonian wind
and then dissolv trickl through itself
wheneer the land that lose shadow breath
so that it seem a fire that melt a taper
een thu wa i without a tear or sigh
befor the song of those who sing for ever
after the music of the etern sphere
but when i heard in their sweet melodi
compass for me more than had thei said
o wherefor ladi dost thou thu upbraid him
the ic that wa about my heart congeal
to air and water chang and in my anguish
through mouth and ey came gush from my breast
she on the righthand border of the car
still firmli stand to those holi be
thu her discours direct afterward
ye keep your watch in the etern dai
so that nor night nor sleep can steal from you
on step the ag make upon their path
therefor my answer is with greater care
that he mai hear me who is weep yonder
so that the sin and dole be of on measur
not onli by the work of those great wheel
that destin everi seed unto some end
accord as the star ar in conjunct
but by the largess of celesti grace
which have such lofti vapour for their rain
that near to them our sight approach not
such had thi man becom in hi new life
potenti that everi righteou habit
would have made admir proof in him
but so much more malign and more savag
becom the land until and with bad seed
the more good earthli vigour it possess
some time did i sustain him with my look
reveal unto him my youth ey
i led him with me turn in the right wai
as soon as ever of my second ag
i wa upon the threshold and chang life
himself from me he took and gave to other
when from the flesh to spirit i ascend
and beauti and virtu were in me increas
i wa to him less dear and less delight
and into wai untru he turn hi step
pursu the fals imag of good
that never ani promis fulfil
nor prayer for inspir me avail
by mean of which in dream and otherwis
i call him back so littl did he heed them
so low he fell that all applianc
for hi salvat were alreadi short
save show him the peopl of perdit
for thi i visit the gate of death
and unto him who so far up ha led him
my intercess were with weep born
god lofti fiat would be violat
if leth should be pass and if such viand

purgatorio canto xxxi
o thou who art beyond the sacr river
turn to me the point of her discours
that edgewis even had seem to me so keen
she recommenc continu without paus
sai sai if thi be true to such a charg
thy own confess need must be conjoin
my faculti were in so great confus
that the voic move but sooner wa extinct
than by it organ it wa set at larg
awhil she wait then she said what thinkest
answer me for the mourn memori
in thee not yet ar by the water injur
confus and dismai togeth mingl
forc such a ye from out my mouth that sight
wa need to the understand of it
even as a crossbow break when ti discharg
too tens drawn the bowstr and the bow
and with less forc the arrow hit the mark
so i gave wai beneath that heavi burden
outpour in a torrent tear and sigh
and the voic flag upon it passag forth
whenc she to me in those desir of mine
which led thee to the love of that good
beyond which there is noth to aspir to
what trench ly travers or what chain
didst thou discov that of pass onward
thou shouldst have thu despoil thee of the hope
and what allur or what vantag
upon the forehead of the other show
that thou shouldst turn thy footstep unto them
after the heav of a bitter sigh
hardli had i the voic to make respons
and with fatigu my lip did fashion it
weep i said the thing that present were
with their fals pleasur turn asid my step
soon as your counten conceal itself
and she shouldst thou be silent or deni
what thou confessest not less manifest
would be thy fault by such a judg ti known
but when from on own cheek come burst forth
the accus of the sin in our tribun
against the edg the wheel doth turn itself
but still that thou mayst feel a greater shame
for thy transgress and anoth time
hear the siren thou mayst be more strong
cast down the seed of weep and attend
so shalt thou hear how in an opposit wai
my buri flesh should have direct thee
never to thee present art or natur
pleasur so great as the fair limb wherein
i wa enclos which scatter ar in earth
and if the highest pleasur thu did fail thee
by reason of my death what mortal thing
should then have drawn thee into it desir
thou oughtest verili at the first shaft
of thing fallaci to have risen up
to follow me who wa no longer such
thou oughtest not to have stoop thy pinion downward
to wait for further blow or littl girl
or other vaniti of such brief us
the callow birdlet wait for two or three
but to the ey of those alreadi fledg
in vain the net is spread or shaft is shot
even as children silent in their shame
stand listen with their ey upon the ground
and consciou of their fault and penit
so wa i stand and she said if thou
in hear sufferest pain lift up thy beard
and thou shalt feel a greater pain in see
with less resist is a robust holm
uproot either by a nativ wind
or els by that from region of iarba
than i uprais at her command my chin
and when she by the beard the face demand
well i perceiv the venom of her mean
and as my counten wa lift up
mine ey perceiv those creatur beauti
had rest from the strew of the flower
and still but littl reassur mine ey
saw beatric turn round toward the monster
that is on person onli in two natur
beneath her veil beyond the margent green
she seem to me far more her ancient self
to excel than other here when she wa here
so prick me then the thorn of penit
that of all other thing the on which turn me
most to it love becam the most my foe
such selfconvict stung me at the heart
oerpow i fell and what i then becam
she knoweth who had furnish me the caus
then when the heart restor my outward sens
the ladi i had found alon abov me
i saw and she wa sai hold me hold me
up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me
and drag me behind her she wa move
upon the water lightli as a shuttl
when i wa near unto the bless shore
asperg me i heard so sweetli sung
rememb it i cannot much less write it
the beauti ladi open wide her arm
embrac my head and plung me underneath
where i wa forc to swallow of the water
then forth she drew me and all drip brought
into the danc of the four beauti
and each on with her arm did cover me
we here ar nymph and in the heaven ar star

well lead thee to her ey but for the pleasant

a thousand long hotter than the flame
fasten mine ey upon those ey reluc

as in a glass the sun not otherwis
within them wa the twofold monster shine
now with the on now with the other natur
think reader if within myself i marvel
when i beheld the thing itself stand still
and in it imag it transform itself
while with amaz fill and jubil
my soul wa tast of the food that while

o splendour of the live light etern
who underneath the shadow of parnassu
ha grown so pale or drunk so at it cistern
he would not seem to have hi mind encumb
strive to paint thee as thou didst appear
where the harmoni heaven oershadow thee

purgatorio canto xxxii
so steadfast and attent were mine ey
in satisfi their decenni thirst
that all my other sens were extinct
and upon thi side and on that thei had
wall of indiffer so the holi smile
drew them unto itself with the old net
when forcibl my sight wa turn awai
toward my left hand by those goddess
becaus i heard from them a too intent
and that condit of the sight which is
in ey but late smitten by the sun
bereft me of my vision some short while
but to the less when sight reshap itself
i sai the less in refer to the greater
splendour from which perforc i had withdrawn
i saw upon it right wing wheel about
the gloriou host return with the sun
and with the sevenfold flame upon their face
as underneath it shield to save itself
a squadron turn and with it banner wheel
befor the whole thereof can chang it front
that soldieri of the celesti kingdom
which march in the advanc had wholli pass us
befor the chariot had turn it pole
then to the wheel the maiden turn themselv
and the griffin move hi burden benedight
but so that not a feather of him flutter
the ladi fair who drew me through the ford
follow with statiu and myself the wheel
which made it orbit with the lesser arc
so pass through the lofti forest vacant
by fault of her who in the serpent trust
angel music made our step keep time
perchanc as great a space had in three flight
an arrow loosen from the string oerpass
as we had move when beatric descend
i heard them murmur altogeth adam
then circl thei about a tree despoil
of bloom and other leafag on each bough
it tress which so much the more dilat
as higher thei ascend had been by indian
among their forest marvel at for height
bless art thou o griffin who dost not
pluck with thy beak these branch sweet to tast
sinc appetit by thi wa turn to evil
after thi fashion round the tree robust
the other shout and the twofold creatur
thu is preserv the seed of all the just
and turn to the pole which he had drag
he drew it close beneath the widow bough
and what wa of it unto it left bound
in the same manner as our tree when downward
fall the great light with that togeth mingl
which after the celesti lasca shine
begin to swell and then renew themselv
each on with it own colour er the sun
har hi steed beneath anoth star
less than of rose and more than violet
a hue disclos wa renew the tree
that had erewhil it bough so desol
i never heard nor here below is sung
the hymn which afterward that peopl sang
nor did i bear the melodi throughout
had i the power to paint how fell asleep
those ey compassionless of syrinx hear
those ey to which more watch cost so dear
even as a painter who from model paint
i would portrai how i wa lull asleep
he mai who well can pictur drowsihood
therefor i pass to what time i awok
and sai a splendour rent from me the veil
of slumber and a call rise what dost thou
as to behold the appletre in blossom
which make the angel greedi for it fruit
and keep perpetu bridal in the heaven
peter and john and jame conduct were
and overcom recov at the word
by which still greater slumber have been broken
and saw their school diminish by the loss
not onli of elia but of mose
and the apparel of their master chang
so i reviv and saw that piteou on
abov me stand who had been conductress
aforetim of my step besid the river
and all in doubt i said where beatric
and she behold her seat underneath
the leafag new upon the root of it
behold the compani that circl her
the rest behind the griffin ar ascend
with more melodi song and more profound
and if her speech were more diffus i know not
becaus alreadi in my sight wa she
who from the hear of aught els had shut me
alon she sat upon the veri earth
left there as guardian of the chariot
which i had seen the biform monster fasten
encircl her a cloister made themselv
the seven nymph with those light in their hand
which ar secur from aquilon and auster
short while shalt thou be here a forest
and thou shalt be with me for evermor
a citizen of that rome where christ is roman
therefor for that world good which liveth ill
fix on the car thine ey and what thou seest
have return to earth take heed thou write
thu beatric and i who at the feet
of her command all devot wa
my mind and ey direct where she will
never descend with so swift a motion
fire from a heavi cloud when it is rain
from out the region which is most remot
as i beheld the bird of jove descend
down through the tree rend awai the bark
as well as blossom and the foliag new
and he with all hi might the chariot smote
whereat it reel like vessel in a tempest
toss by the wave now starboard and now larboard
thereaft saw i leap into the bodi
of the triumphal vehicl a fox
that seem unf with ani wholesom food
but for hi hideou sin upbraid him
my ladi put him to as swift a flight
as such a fleshless skeleton could bear
then by the wai that it befor had come
into the chariot chest i saw the eagl
descend and leav it feather with hi plume
and such as issu from a heart that mourn
a voic from heaven there issu and it said
my littl bark how badli art thou freight
methought then that the earth did yawn between
both wheel and i saw rise from it a dragon
who through the chariot upward fix hi tail
and as a wasp that draweth back it sting
draw unto himself hi tail malign
drew out the floor and went hi wai rejoic
that which remain behind even as with grass
a fertil region with the feather offer
perhap with pure intent and benign
recloth itself and with them were recloth
the pole and both the wheel so speedili
a sigh doth longer keep the lip apart

thrust forward head upon the part of it
three on the pole and on at either corner
the first were horn like oxen but the four
had but a singl horn upon the forehead
a monster such had never yet been seen
firm as a rock upon a mountain high
seat upon it there appear to me
a shameless whore with ey swift glanc round
and as if not to have her taken from him
upright besid her i beheld a giant
and ever and anon thei kiss each other
but becaus she her wanton rove ey
turn upon me her angri paramour
did scourg her from her head unto her feet
then full of jealousi and fierc with wrath
he loos the monster and across the forest
drag it so far he made of that alon
a shield unto the whore and the strang beast

thou art not upon earth as thou believest

if of my former doubt i wa divest
by these brief littl word more smile than spoken

that sun which erst with love my bosom warm
of beauteou truth had unto me discov
by prove and reprov the sweet aspect
and that i might confess myself convinc
and confid so far as wa befit
i lift more erect my head to speak
but there appear a vision which withdrew me
so close to it in order to be seen
that my confess i rememb not
such as through polish and transpar glass
or water crystallin and undisturb
but not so deep as that their bed be lost
come back again the outlin of our face
so feebl that a pearl on forehead white

such saw i mani face prompt to speak
so that i ran in error opposit
to that which kindl love twixt man and fountain
as soon as i becam awar of them
esteem them as mirror semblanc
to see of whom thei were mine ey i turn
and noth saw and onc more turn them forward
direct into the light of my sweet guid
who smile kindl in her holi ey
marvel thou not she said to me becaus
i smile at thi thy pueril conceit
sinc on the truth it trust not yet it foot
but turn thee as ti wont on empti
true substanc ar these which thou beholdest
here releg for break of some vow
therefor speak with them listen and believ
for the true light which giveth peac to them
permit them not to turn from it their feet
and i unto the shade that seem most wish

as on whom too great eager bewild
o wellcreat spirit who in the rai

whereat she promptli and with laugh ey
our chariti doth never shut the door
against a just desir except as on
who will that all her court be like herself
i wa a virgin sister in the world
and if thy mind doth contempl me well
the be more fair will not conceal me from thee
but thou shalt recognis i am piccarda
who station here among these other bless
myself am bless in the slowest sphere
all our affect that alon inflam

rejoic at be of hi order form
and thi allot which appear so low
therefor is given us becaus our vow
have been neglect and in some part void
whenc i to her in your miracul aspect
there shine i know not what of the divin
which doth transform you from our first concept
therefor i wa not swift in my remembr
but what thou tellest me now aid me so
that the refigur is easier to me
but tell me ye who in thi place ar happi
ar you desir of a higher place
to see more or to make yourselv more friend
first with those other shade she smile a littl
thereaft answer me so full of glad
she seem to burn in the first fire of love
brother our will is quiet by virtu
of chariti that make us wish alon
for what we have nor give us thirst for more
if to be more exalt we aspir
discord would our aspir be
unto the will of him who here seclud us
which thou shalt see find no place in these circl
if be in chariti is need here
and if thou lookest well into it natur
nai ti essenti to thi blest exist
to keep itself within the will divin
wherebi our veri wish ar made on
so that as we ar station abov station
throughout thi realm to all the realm ti pleas
as to the king who make hi will our will
and hi will is our peac thi is the sea
to which is move onward whatsoev

then it wa clear to me how everywher
in heaven is paradis although the grace
of good suprem there rain not in on measur
but as it come to pass if on food sate
and for anoth still remain the long
we ask for thi and that declin with thank
een thu did i with gestur and with word
to learn from her what wa the web wherein
she did not ply the shuttl to the end
a perfect life and merit high inheaven
a ladi oer us said she by whose rule
down in your world thei vest and veil themselv
that until death thei mai both watch and sleep
besid that spous who everi vow accept
which chariti conformeth to hi pleasur
to follow her in girlhood from the world
i fled and in her habit shut myself
and pledg me to the pathwai of her sect
then men accustom unto evil more
than unto good from the sweet cloister tore me
god know what afterward my life becam
thi other splendour which to thee reveal
itself on my right side and is enkindl
with all the illumin of our sphere
what of myself i sai appli to her
a nun wa she and likewis from her head
wa taen the shadow of the sacr wimpl
but when she too wa to the world return
against her wish and against good usag
of the heart veil she never wa divest
of great costanza thi is the effulg
who from the second wind of suabia
brought forth the third and latest puissanc
thu unto me she spake and then began
av maria sing and in sing
vanish as through deep water someth heavi
my sight that follow her as long a time
as it wa possibl when it had lost her
turn round unto the mark of more desir
and wholli unto beatric revert
but she such lightn flash into mine ey
that at the first my sight endur it not

henc if i held my peac myself i blame not
impel in equal measur by my doubt
sinc it must be so nor do i commend
i held my peac but my desir wa paint
upon my face and question with that
more fervent far than by articul speech
beatric did as daniel had done
reliev nebuchadnezzar from the wrath
which render him unjustli merciless
and said well see i how attracteth thee

thou arguest if good will be perman

doth it decreas the measur of my merit
again for doubt furnish thee occas
soul seem to return unto the star
accord to the sentiment of plato
these ar the question which upon thy wish

he of the seraphim most absorb in god
mose and samuel and whichev john
thou mayst select i sai and even mari

and have sweet life in differ degre
by feel more or less the etern breath
thei show themselv here not becaus allot
thi sphere ha been to them but to give sign
of the celesti which is least exalt
to speak thu is adapt to your mind
sinc onli through the sens it apprehendeth
what then it worthi make of intellect
on thi account the scriptur condescend
unto your faculti and feet and hand
to god attribut and mean someth els
and holi church under an aspect human
gabriel and michael repres to you
and him who made tobia whole again
that which timaeu argu of the soul
doth not resembl that which here is seen
becaus it seem that as he speak he think
he sai the soul unto it star return
believ it to have been sever thenc
whenev natur gave it as a form
perhap hi doctrin is of other guis
than the word sound and possibl mai be
with mean that is not to be derid
if he doth mean that to these wheel return
the honour of their influenc and the blame
perhap hi bow doth hit upon some truth
thi principl ill understood onc warp
the whole world nearli till it went astrai
invok jove and mercuri and mar
the other doubt which doth disquiet thee
less venom ha for it malevol
could never lead thee otherwher from me
that as unjust our justic should appear
in ey of mortal is an argument
of faith and not of sin heret
but still that your percept mai be abl
to thoroughli penetr thi veriti
as thou desirest i will satisfi thee
if it be violenc when he who suffer
cooper not with him who us forc
these soul were not on that account excus
for will is never quench unless it will
but oper as natur doth in fire
if violenc a thousand time distort it
henc if it yieldeth more or less it second
the forc and these have done so have power
of turn back unto the holi place
if their will had been perfect like to that
which lawrenc fast upon hi gridiron held
and mutiu made sever to hi own hand
it would have urg them back along the road
whenc thei were drag as soon as thei were free
but such a solid will is all too rare
and by these word if thou hast gather them
as thou shouldst do the argument is refut
that would have still annoi thee mani time
but now anoth passag run across
befor thine ey and such that by thyself
thou couldst not thread it er thou wouldst be weari
i have for certain put into thy mind
that soul beatifi could never lie
for it is near the primal truth
and then thou from piccarda mightst have heard
costanza kept affect for the veil
so that she seemeth here to contradict me
mani time brother ha it come to pass
that to escap from peril with reluct
that ha been done it wa not right to do
een as alcmaeon who be by hi father
thereto entreat hi own mother slew
not to lose piti pitiless becam
at thi point i desir thee to rememb
that forc with will commingl and thei caus
that the offenc cannot be excus
will absolut consenteth not to evil
but in so far consenteth as it fear
if it refrain to fall into more harm
henc when piccarda us thi express
she meaneth the will absolut and i
the other so that both of us speak truth
such wa the flow of the holi river
that issu from the fount whenc spring all truth
thi put to rest my wish on and all
o love of the first lover o divin
said i forthwith whose speech inund me
and warm me so it more and more reviv me
my own affect is not so profound
as to suffic in render grace for grace
let him who see and can thereto respond
well i perceiv that never sate is
our intellect unless the truth illum it
beyond which noth true expand itself
it rest therein as wild beast in hi lair
when it attain it and it can attain it
if not then each desir would frustrat be
therefor spring up in fashion of a shoot
doubt at the foot of truth and thi is natur
which to the top from height to height impel us
thi doth invit me thi assur give me
with rever ladi to inquir of you
anoth truth which is obscur to me
i wish to know if man can satisfi you
for broken vow with other good deed so
that in your balanc thei will not be light
beatric gaze upon me with her ey
full of the spark of love and so divin

marvel thou not thereat for thi proce

well i perceiv how is alreadi shine
into thine intellect the etern light
that onli seen enkindl alwai love
and if some other thing your love seduc
ti noth but a vestig of the same
ill understood which there is shine through
thou fain wouldst know if with anoth servic
for broken vow can such return be made
as to secur the soul from further claim
thi canto thu did beatric begin
and as a man who break not off hi speech
continu thu her holi argument
the greatest gift that in hi largess god
creat made and unto hi own good
nearest conform and that which he doth prize
most highli is the freedom of the will
wherewith the creatur of intellig
both all and onli were and ar endow
now wilt thou see if thenc thou reasonest
the high worth of a vow if it he made
so that when thou consentest god consent
for close between god and man the compact
a sacrific is of thi treasur made
such as i sai and made by it own act
what can be render then as compens
thinkst thou to make good us of what thoust offer
with gain ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed
now art thou certain of the greater point
but becaus holi church in thi dispens
which seem against the truth which i have shown thee
behov thee still to sit awhil at tabl
becaus the solid food which thou hast taken
requireth further aid for thy digest
open thy mind to that which i reveal

thi last for evermor is cancel not
unless compli with and concern thi

therefor it wa enjoin upon the hebrew

might be commut as thou oughtst to know
the other which is known to thee as matter

but let none shift the burden on hi shoulder

therefor whatev thing ha so great weight

let mortal never take a vow in jest

then near unto the time when heaven had will
to bring the whole world to it mood seren
did caesar by the will of rome assum it
what it achiev from var unto the rhine

now unto what is said direct thy sight
thi natur when unit to it maker
such as creat wa sincer and good

earth trembl at it and the heaven wa open
it should no longer now seem difficult

return to fruit of the ital grass
on the rude rock twixt tiber and the arno

move slow and doubt and in number few
when the emperor who reigneth evermor
provid for the host that wa in peril

and as wa said he to hi bride brought succour
with champion twain at whose deed at whose word
the straggl peopl were togeth drawn
within that region where the sweet west wind

not far off from the beat of the wave

that he began to go about the vineyard
which fadeth soon if faithless be the dresser
and of the see that onc wa more benign

not to dispens or two or three for six
not ani fortun of first vacanc

permiss to do battl for the seed
of which these four and twenti plant surround thee
then with the doctrin and the will togeth

so that the mould is where wa onc the crust
hi famili that had straight forward move

let him the mouth imagin of the horn

that on should forward go the other backward

so much enamour i becam therewith

as through the pure and tranquil even air

noth is miss and thi endureth littl
so from the horn that to the right extend
unto that crosss foot there ran a star

that with mine own methought i touch the bottom

the first thing that wa understood by me
wa benedight be thou o trine and on

drawn from the read of the mighti volum

thou hast appeas my son within thi light
in which i speak to thee by grace of her
who to thi lofti flight with plumag cloth thee
thou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass
from him who is the first as from the unit
if that be known rai out the five and six
and therefor who i am thou askest not
and why i seem more joyou unto thee
than ani other of thi gladsom crowd
thou thinkst the truth becaus the small and great
of thi exist look into the mirror
wherein befor thou thinkst thy thought thou showest
but that the sacr love in which i watch
with sight perpetu and which make me thirst
with sweet desir mai better be fulfil
now let thy voic secur and frank and glad
proclaim the wish the desir proclaim
to which my answer is decre alreadi
to beatric i turn me and she heard
befor i spake and smile to me a sign
that made the wing of my desir increas
then in thi wise began i love and knowledg
when on you dawn the first equal
of the same weight for each of you becam
for in the sun which light you and burn

all those who at that time were there between

pure in the lowest artisan wa seen

on him reli and on hi benefit
by him shall mani peopl be transform

and written in thy mind thou henc shalt bear

incred to those who shall be present
then ad son these ar the commentari
on what wa said to thee behold the snare
that ar conceal behind few revolut
yet would i not thy neighbour thou shouldst envi
becaus thy life into the futur reach
beyond the punish of their perfidi
when by it silenc show that saint soul
that it had finish put in the woof
into that web which i had given it warp
began i even as he who yearneth after
be in doubt some counsel from a person
who seeth and uprightli will and love
well see i father mine how spurreth on
the time toward me such a blow to deal me
as heaviest is to him who most give wai
therefor with foresight it is well i arm me
that if the dearest place be taken from me
i mai not lose the other by my song
down through the world of infinit bitter
and oer the mountain from whose beauteou summit
the ey of my own ladi lift me
and afterward through heaven from light to light
i have learn that which if i tell again
will be a savour of strong herb to mani
and if i am a timid friend to truth
i fear lest i mai lose my life with those
who will hereaft call thi time the olden
the light in which wa smile my own treasur
which there i had discov flash at first
as in the sunshin doth a golden mirror
then made repli a conscienc overcast
or with it own or with anoth shame
will tast forsooth the tart of thy word
but neertheless all falsehood laid asid
make manifest thy vision utterli
and let them scratch wherev is the itch
for if thine utter shall offens be
at the first tast a vital nutriment
twill leav thereaft when it is digest
thi cry of thine shall do as doth the wind
which smiteth most the most exalt summit
and that is no slight argument of honour
therefor ar shown to thee within these wheel
upon the mount and in the dolor vallei
onli the soul that unto fame ar known
becaus the spirit of the hearer rest not
nor doth confirm it faith by an exampl
which ha the root of it unknown and hidden
or other reason that is not appar
paradiso canto xviii
now wa alon rejoic in it word
that soul beatifi and i wa tast
my own the bitter temper with the sweet
and the ladi who to god wa lead me
said chang thy thought consid that i am
near unto him who everi wrong disburden
unto the love accent of my comfort
i turn me round and then what love i saw
within those holi ey i here relinquish
not onli that my languag i distrust
but that my mind cannot return so far
abov itself unless anoth guid it
thu much upon that point can i repeat
that her again behold my affect
from everi other long wa releas
while the etern pleasur which direct
rai upon beatric from her fair face
content me with it reflect aspect
conquer me with the radianc of a smile
she said to me turn thee about and listen
not in mine ey alon is paradis
even as sometim here do we behold
the affect in the look if it be such
that all the soul is wrapt awai by it
so by the flame of the effulg holi
to which i turn i recogn therein
the wish of speak to me somewhat farther
and it began in thi fifth restingplac
upon the tree that liveth by it summit
and ay bear fruit and never lose leaf
ar bless spirit that below er yet
thei came to heaven were of such great renown
that everi muse therewith would affluent be
therefor look thou upon the crosss horn
he whom i now shall name will there enact
what doth within a cloud it own swift fire
i saw athwart the cross a splendour drawn
by name joshua even as he did it
nor note i the word befor the deed
and at the name of the great maccabe
i saw anoth move itself revolv
and glad wa the whip unto that top
likewis for charlemagn and for orlando
two of them my regard attent follow
as followeth the ey it falcon fly
william thereafterward and renouard
and the duke godfrei did attract my sight
along upon that cross and robert guiscard
then move and mingl with the other light
the soul that had address me show how great
an artist twa among the heavenli singer
to my right side i turn myself around
my duti to behold in beatric
either by word or gestur signifi
and so transluc i beheld her ey
so full of pleasur that her counten
surpass it other and it latest wont
and as by feel greater delect
a man in do good from dai to dai
becom awar hi virtu is increas
so i becam awar that my gyrat
with heaven togeth had increas it arc
that miracl behold more adorn
and such as is the chang in littl laps
of time in a pale woman when her face
is from the load of bash unladen
such wa it in mine ey when i had turn
caus by the white of the temper star
the sixth which to itself had gather me
within that jovial torch did i behold
the sparkl of the love which wa therein
delin our languag to mine ey
and even as bird uprisen from the shore
as in congratul oer their food
make squadron of themselv now round now long
so from within those light the holi creatur
sang fly to and fro and in their figur
made of themselv now d now i now l

then on becom of these charact
a littl while thei rest and were silent
o divin pegasea thou who geniu

and thi through thee the citi and the kingdom

qui judicati terram were the last
thereaft in the m of the fifth word
remain thei so arrang that jupit

and other light i saw descend where wa

the good i think that draw them to itself
then as in strike upon burn log
upward there fly innumer spark
whenc fool ar wont to look for auguri
more than a thousand light seem thenc to rise
and to ascend some more and other less
even as the sun that light them had allot
and each on be quiet in it place
the head and neck beheld i of an eagl

he who there paint ha none to be hi guid
but himself guid and is from him rememb
that virtu which is form unto the nest
the other beatitud that content seem

so that a second time it now be wroth
with bui and with sell in the templ
whose wall were built with sign and martyrdom
o soldieri of heaven whom i contempl

so doth a singl heat from mani ember
make itself felt even as from mani love

whenc i thereaft o perpetu flower

well do i know that if in heaven it mirror

you know how i attent address me

that is in me so veri old a fast
even as a falcon issu from hi hood

show desir and make himself fine
saw i becom that standard which of laud
wa interwoven of the grace divin
with such song as he know who there rejoic
then it began he who a compass turn
on the world outer verg and who within it
devis so much occult and manifest
could not the impress of hi power so make
on all the univers as that hi word
should not remain in infinit excess
and thi make certain that the first proud be
who wa the paragon of everi creatur
by not await light fell immatur
and henc appear it that each minor natur
is scant receptacl unto that good
which ha no end and by itself is measur
in consequ our vision which perforc
must be some rai of that intellig
with which all thing whatev ar replet
cannot in it own natur be so potent
that it shall not it origin discern
far beyond that which is appar to it
therefor into the justic sempitern
the power of vision that your world receiv
as ey into the ocean penetr
which though it see the bottom near the shore
upon the deep perceiv it not and yet

there is no light but come from the seren

ampli to thee is open now the cavern

of which thou madst such frequent question
for saidst thou born a man is on the shore
of indu and is none who there can speak
of christ nor who can read nor who can write
and all hi inclin and hi action

without a sin in life or in discours
he dieth unbaptis and without faith
where is thi justic that condemneth him
where is hi fault if he do not believ
now who art thou that on the bench wouldst sit
in judgment at a thousand mile awai
with the short vision of a singl span
truli to him who with me subtil
if so the scriptur were not over you

so much is just as is accord with it
no good creat draw it to itself

even as abov her nest goe circl round

such is the etern judgment to you mortal
those lucent splendour of the holi spirit
grew quiet then but still within the standard

for which the realm of pragu shall be desert

paradiso canto xx
when he who all the world illumin
out of our hemispher so far descend
that on all side the daylight is consum
the heaven that erst by him alon wa kindl
doth suddenli reveal itself again
by mani light wherein is on resplend
and came into my mind thi act of heaven
when the ensign of the world and of it leader
had silent in the bless beak becom
becaus those live luminari all
by far more lumin did song begin
laps and fall from my memori
o gentl love that with a smile dost cloak thee
how ardent in those spark didst thou appear
that had the breath alon of holi thought
after the preciou and pellucid crystal
with which begem the sixth light i beheld
silenc impos on the angel bell
i seem to hear the murmur of a river
that clear descendeth down from rock to rock
show the affluenc of it mountaintop
and as the sound upon the cithern neck
taketh it form and as upon the vent
of rustic pipe the wind that enter it
even thu reliev from the delai of wait
that murmur of the eagl mount up
along it neck as if it had been hollow
there it becam a voic and issu thenc
from out it beak in such a form of word
as the heart wait for wherein i wrote them
the part in me which see and bear the sun
in mortal eagl it began to me
now fixedli must need be look upon
for of the fire of which i make my figur
those whenc the ey doth sparkl in my head
of all their order the supremest ar
he who is shine in the midst as pupil
wa onc the singer of the holi spirit
who bore the ark from citi unto citi
now knoweth he the merit of hi song
in so far as effect of hi own counsel
by the reward which is commensur
of five that make a circl for my brow
he that approacheth nearest to my beak
did the poor widow for her son consol
now knoweth he how dearli it doth cost
not follow christ by the experi
of thi sweet life and of it opposit
he who come next in the circumfer
of which i speak upon it highest arc
did death postpon by penit sincer
now knoweth he that the etern judgment
suffer no chang albeit worthi prayer
maketh below tomorrow of todai
the next who follow with the law and me
under the good intent that bore bad fruit
becam a greek by cede to the pastor
now knoweth he how all the ill deduc
from hi good action is not harm to him
although the world therebi mai be destroi
and he whom in the downward arc thou seest
guglielmo wa whom the same land deplor
that weepeth charl and frederick yet aliv
now knoweth he how heaven enamour is
with a just king and in the outward show
of hi effulg he reveal it still
who would believ down in the errant world
that eer the trojan ripheu in thi round
could be the fifth on of the holi light
now knoweth he enough of what the world
ha not the power to see of grace divin
although hi sight mai not discern the bottom
like as a lark that in the air expati
first sing and then silent with content
of the last sweet that doth satisfi her
such seem to me the imag of the imprint
of the etern pleasur by whose will
doth everyth becom the thing it is
and notwithstand to my doubt i wa
as glass is to the colour that invest it
to wait the time in silenc it endur not
but forth from out my mouth what thing ar these
extort with the forc of it own weight
whereat i saw great joi of corusc
thereafterward with ey still more enkindl
the bless standard made to me repli
to keep me not in wonder suspend
i see that thou believest in these thing
becaus i sai them but thou seest not how
so that although believ in thei ar hidden
thou doest as he doth who a thing by name
well apprehendeth but it quidditi
cannot perceiv unless anoth show it
regnum coelorum suffereth violenc
from fervent love and from that live hope
that overcometh the divin volit
not in the guis that man oercometh man
but conquer it becaus it will be conquer
and conquer conquer by benign
the first life of the eyebrow and the fifth
caus thee astonish becaus with them
thou seest the region of the angel paint
thei pass not from their bodi as thou thinkest
gentil but christian in the steadfast faith
of feet that were to suffer and had suffer
for on from hell where no on eer turn back
unto good will return unto hi bone
and that of live hope wa the reward
of live hope that place it efficaci
in prayer to god made to resuscit him
so that twere possibl to move hi will
the gloriou soul concern which i speak
return to the flesh where brief it stai
believ in him who had the power to aid it
and in believ kindl to such fire
of genuin love that at the second death
worthi it wa to come unto thi joi
the other on through grace that from so deep
a fountain well that never hath the ey
of ani creatur reach it primal wave
set all hi love below on righteous
wherefor from grace to grace did god unclos
hi ey to our redempt yet to be
whenc he believ therein and suffer not
from that dai forth the stench of pagan
and he reprov therefor the folk pervers
those maiden three whom at the righthand wheel
thou didst behold were unto him for baptism
more than a thousand year befor baptiz
o thou predestin how remot
thy root is from the aspect of all those
who the first caus do not behold entir
and you o mortal hold yourselv restrain
in judg for ourselv who look on god
we do not know as yet all the elect
and sweet to us is such a depriv
becaus our good in thi good is made perfect
that whatsoeer god will we also will
after thi manner by that shape divin
to make clear in me my shortsighted
wa given to me a pleasant medicin
and as good singer a good lutanist
accompani with vibrat of the chord
wherebi more pleasant the song acquir
so while it spake do i rememb me
that i beheld both of those bless light
even as the wink of the ey concord
move unto the word their littl flame
paradiso canto xxi
alreadi on my ladi face mine ey
again were fasten and with these my mind
and from all other purpos wa withdrawn
and she smile not but if i were to smile
she unto me began thou wouldst becom
like semel when she wa turn to ash
becaus my beauti that along the stair
of the etern palac more enkindl
as thou hast seen the farther we ascend
if it were temper not is so resplend
that all thy mortal power in it effulg
would seem a leaflet that the thunder crush
we ar uplift to the seventh splendour
that underneath the burn lion breast
now radiat downward mingl with hi power
fix in direct of thine ey the mind
and make of them a mirror for the figur
that in thi mirror shall appear to thee
he who could know what wa the pasturag
my sight had in that bless counten
when i transfer me to anoth care
would recogn how grate wa to me
obedi unto my celesti escort
by counterpois on side with the other
within the crystal which around the world
revolv bear the name of it dear leader
under whom everi wicked lai dead
colour like gold on which the sunshin gleam
a stairwai i beheld to such a height
uplift that mine ey pursu it not
likewis beheld i down the step descend
so mani splendour that i thought each light
that in the heaven appear wa there diffus
and as accord with their natur custom
the rook togeth at the break of dai
bestir themselv to warm their feather cold
then some of them fly off without return
other come back to where thei start from
and other wheel round still keep at home
such fashion it appear to me wa there
within the sparkl that togeth came
as soon as on a certain step it struck
and that which nearest unto us remain
becam so clear that in my thought i said
well i perceiv the love thou showest me
but she from whom i wait the how and when
of speech and silenc standeth still whenc i
against desir do well if i ask not
she thereupon who saw my silent
in the sight of him who seeth everyth
said unto me let loos thy warm desir
and i began no merit of my own
render me worthi of respons from thee
but for her sake who granteth me the ask
thou bless life that dost remain conceal
in thy beatitud make known to me
the caus which draweth thee so near my side
and tell me why is silent in thi wheel
the dulcet symphoni of paradis
that through the rest below sound so devoutli
thou hast thy hear mortal as thy sight
it answer made to me thei sing not here
for the same caus that beatric ha not smile
thu far adown the holi stairwai step
have i descend but to give thee welcom
with word and with the light that mantl me
nor did more love caus me to be more readi
for love as much and more up there is burn
as doth the flame manifest to thee
but the high chariti that make us servant
prompt to the counsel which control the world
allotteth here even as thou dost observ
i see full well said i o sacr lamp
how love unfett in thi court sufficeth
to follow the etern provid
but thi is what seem hard for me to see
wherefor predestin wast thou alon
unto thi offic from among thy consort
no sooner had i come to the last word
than of it middl made the light a centr
whirl itself about like a swift millston
when answer made the love that wa therein
on me direct is a light divin
pierc through thi in which i am embosom
of which the virtu with my sight conjoin
lift me abov myself so far i see
the suprem essenc from which thi is drawn
henc come the joy with which i flame
for to my sight as far as it is clear
the clear of the flame i equal make
but that soul in the heaven which is most pure
that seraph which hi ey on god most fix
could thi demand of thine not satisfi
becaus so deepli sink in the abyss
of the etern statut what thou askest
from all creat sight it is cut off
and to the mortal world when thou returnest
thi carri back that it mai not presum
longer towrd such a goal to move it feet
the mind that shineth here on earth doth smoke
from thi observ how can it do below
that which it cannot though the heaven assum it
such limit did it word prescrib to me
the question i relinquish and restrict
myself to ask it humbl who it wa
between two shore of itali rise cliff
and not far distant from thy nativ place
so high the thunder far below them sound
and form a ridg that catria is call
neath which is consecr a hermitag
wont to be dedic to worship onli
thu unto me the third speech recommenc
and then continu it said therein
unto god servic i becam so steadfast
that feed onli on the juic of oliv
lightli i pass awai the heat and frost
content in my thought contempl
that cloister us to render to these heaven
abundantli and now is empti grown
so that perforc it soon must be reveal
i in that place wa peter damiano
and peter the sinner wa i in the hous
of our ladi on the adriat shore
littl of mortal life remain to me
when i wa call and drag forth to the hat
which shifteth evermor from bad to wors
came cepha and the mighti vessel came
of the holi spirit meagr and barefoot
take the food of ani hostelri
now some on to support them on each side
the modern shepherd need and some to lead them
so heavi ar thei and to hold their train
thei cover up their palfrei with their cloak
so that two beast go underneath on skin
o patienc that dost toler so much
at thi voic saw i mani littl flame
from step to step descend and revolv
and everi revolut made them fairer
round about thi on came thei and stood still
and a cry utter of so loud a sound
it here could find no parallel nor i
distinguish it the thunder so oercam me
paradiso canto xxii
oppress with stupor i unto my guid
turn like a littl child who alwai run
for refug there where he confideth most
and she even as a mother who straightwai
give comfort to her pale and breathless boi
with voic whose wont it is to reassur him
said to me knowest thou not thou art in heaven
and knowest thou not that heaven is holi all
and what is done here cometh from good zeal
after what wise the sing would have chang thee
and i by smile thou canst now imagin
sinc that the cry ha startl thee so much
in which if thou hadst understood it prayer
alreadi would be known to thee the vengeanc
which thou shalt look upon befor thou diest
the sword abov here smiteth not in hast
nor tardili howeer it seem to him
who fear or desir wait for it
but turn thee round toward the other now
for veri illustri spirit shalt thou see
if thou thy sight directest as i sai
as it seem good to her mine ey i turn
and saw a hundr spherul that togeth
with mutual rai each other more embellish
i stood as on who in himself repress
the point of hi desir and ventur not
to question he so feareth the too much
and now the largest and most lucul
among those pearl came forward that it might
make my desir concern it content
within it then i heard if thou couldst see
even as myself the chariti that burn
among us thy conceit would be express
but that by wait thou mayst not come late
to the high end i will make answer even
unto the thought of which thou art so chari
that mountain on whose slope cassino stand
wa frequent of old upon it summit
by a delud folk and illdispos
and i am he who first up thither bore
the name of him who brought upon the earth
the truth that so much sublimateth us
and such abund grace upon me shone
that all the neighbour town i drew awai
from the impiou worship that seduc the world
these other fire each on of them were men
contempl enkindl by that heat
which maketh holi flower and fruit spring up
here is macariu here is romualdu
here ar my brethren who within the cloister
their footstep stai and kept a steadfast heart
and i to him the affect which thou showest
speak with me and the good counten
which i behold and note in all your ardour
in me have so my confid dilat
as the sun doth the rose when it becom
as far unfold as it hath the power
therefor i prai and thou assur me father
if i mai so much grace receiv that i
mai thee behold with counten unveil
he thereupon brother thy high desir
in the remotest sphere shall be fulfil
where ar fulfil all other and my own
there perfect is and ripen and complet
everi desir within that on alon
is everi part where it ha alwai been
for it is not in space nor turn on pole
and unto it our stairwai reach up
whenc thu from out thy sight it steal awai
up to that height the patriarch jacob saw it
extend it supern part what time
so throng with angel it appear to him
but to ascend it now no on uplift
hi feet from off the earth and now my rule
below remaineth for mere wast of paper
the wall that us of old to be an abbei
ar chang to den of robber and the cowl
ar sack fill full of miser flour
but heavi usuri is not taken up
so much against god pleasur as that fruit
which maketh so insan the heart of monk
for whatsoev hath the church in keep
is for the folk that ask it in god name
not for on kindr or for someth wors
the flesh of mortal is so veri soft
that good begin down below suffic not
from spring of the oak to bear acorn
peter began with neither gold nor silver
and i with orison and abstin
and franci with humil hi convent
and if thou lookest at each on begin
and then regardest whither he ha run
thou shalt behold the white chang into brown
in veriti the jordan backward turn
and the sea flee when god will were more
a wonder to behold than succour here
thu unto me he said and then withdrew
to hi own band and the band close togeth
then like a whirlwind all wa upward rapt
the gentl ladi urg me on behind them
up oer that stairwai by a singl sign
so did her virtu overcom my natur
nor here below where on goe up and down
by natur law wa motion eer so swift
that it could be compar unto my wing
reader as i mai unto that devout
triumph return on whose account i often
for my transgress weep and beat my breast
thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire
and drawn it out again befor i saw
the sign that follow tauru and wa in it
o gloriou star o light impregn
with mighti virtu from which i acknowledg
all of my geniu whatsoeer it be
with you wa born and hid himself with you
he who is father of all mortal life
when first i tast of the tuscan air
and then when grace wa freeli given to me
to enter the high wheel which turn you round
your region wa allot unto me
to you devoutli at thi hour my soul
is sigh that it virtu mai acquir
for the stern pass that draw it to itself
thou art so near unto the last salvat
thu beatric began thou oughtest now

then turn i round to beatric and she

when she with fire i ever burn with enter
the good that give content to thi court
the alpha and omega is of all
the write that love read me low or loud
the selfsam voic that taken had from me
the terror of the sudden dazzlement
to speak still farther put it in my thought
and said in veriti with finer siev
behoveth thee to sift thee it behoveth
to sai who aim thy bow at such a target
and i by philosoph argument
and by author that henc descend
such love must need imprint itself in me
for good so far as good when comprehend
doth straight enkindl love and so much greater
as more of good in itself it hold
then to that essenc whose is such advantag
that everi good which out of it is found
is noth but a rai of it own light
more than elsewhith must the mind be move
of everi on in love who discern
the truth in which thi evid is found
such truth he to my intellect reveal
who demonstr to me the primal love

who sai to mose speak of himself

thou too revealest it to me begin

and by author concord with it
of all thy love reserv for god the highest
but sai again if other cord thou feelest
draw thee toward him that thou mayst proclaim
with how mani teeth thi love is bite thee
the holi purpos of the eagl of christ
not latent wa nai rather i perceiv
whither he fain would my profess lead
therefor i recommenc all of those bite
which have the power to turn the heart to god
unto my chariti have been concurr
the be of the world and my own be
the death which he endur that i mai live
and that which all the faith hope as i do
with the forement vivid conscious
have drawn me from the sea of love pervers
and of the right have place me on the shore
the leav wherewith embow is all the garden
of the etern garden do i love
as much as he ha grant them of good
as soon as i had ceas a song most sweet
throughout the heaven resound and my ladi
said with the other holi holi holi
and as at some keen light on wake from sleep
by reason of the visual spirit that run
unto the splendour pass from coat to coat
and he who wake abhorreth what he see
so all unconsci is hi sudden wake
until the judgment cometh to hi aid
so from befor mine ey did beatric
chase everi mote with radianc of her own
that cast it light a thousand mile and more
whenc better after than befor i saw
and in a kind of wonder i ask
about a fourth light that i saw with us
and said my ladi there within those rai

that ever the first virtu did creat
even as the bough that downward bend it top
at transit of the wind and then is lift

thou fain wouldst hear how long ago god place me

and whatsoev star seem smallest here
would seem to be a moon if place besid it
as on star with anoth star is place
perhap at such a distanc as appear
a halo cinctur the light that paint it
when densest is the vapour that sustain it
thu distant round the point a circl of fire
so swiftli whirl that it would have surpass
whatev motion soonest gird the world
and thi wa by anoth circumcinct
that by a third the third then by a fourth
by a fifth the fourth and then by a sixth the fifth
the seventh follow thereupon in width
so ampl now that juno messeng
entir would be too narrow to contain it
even so the eighth and ninth and everi on
more slowli move accord as it wa
in number distant farther from the first
and that on had it flame most crystallin
from which less distant wa the stainless spark
i think becaus more with it truth imbu
my ladi who in my anxieti
beheld me much perplex said from that point
depend is the heaven and natur all
behold that circl most conjoin to it
and know thou that it motion is so swift
through burn love wherebi it is spur on
and i to her if the world were arrang
in the order which i see in yonder wheel
what set befor me would have satisfi me
but in the world of sens we can perceiv
that evermor the circl ar divin
as thei ar from the centr more remot
wherefor if my desir is to be end
in thi miracul and angel templ
that ha for confin onli love and light
to hear behov me still how the exampl
and the exemplar go not in on fashion
sinc for myself in vain i contempl it
if thine own finger unto such a knot
be insuffici it is no great wonder
so hard hath it becom for want of try
my ladi thu then said she do thou take
what i shall tell thee if thou wouldst be sate
and exercis on that thy subtleti
the circl corpor ar wide and narrow
accord to the more or less of virtu
which is distribut through all their part
the greater good work the greater weal
the greater weal the greater bodi hold
if perfect equal ar all it part
therefor thi on which sweep along with it
the univers sublim doth correspond
unto the circl which most love and know
on which account if thou unto the virtu
appli thy measur not to the appear
of substanc that unto thee seem round
thou wilt behold a marvel agreement
of more to greater and of less to smaller
in everi heaven with it intellig
even as remaineth splendid and seren
the hemispher of air when borea
is blow from that cheek where he is mildest
becaus is purifi and resolv the rack
that erst disturb it till the welkin laugh
with all the beauti of it pageantri
thu did i likewis after that my ladi
had me provid with her clear respons
and like a star in heaven the truth wa seen
and soon as to a stop her word had come
not otherwis doe iron scintil
when molten than those circl scintil
their corusc all the spark repeat
and thei so mani were their number make
more million than the doubl of the chess
i heard them sing hosanna choir by choir
to the fix point which hold them at the ubi
and ever will where thei have ever been
and she who saw the dubiou medit
within my mind the primal circl said
have shown thee seraphim and cherubim
thu rapidli thei follow their own bond
to be as like the point as most thei can
and can as far as thei ar high in vision
those other love that round about them go
throne of the counten divin ar call
becaus thei termin the primal triad
and thou shouldst know that thei all have delight
as much as their own vision penetr
the truth in which all intellect find rest
from thi it mai be seen how blessed
is found in the faculti which see
and not in that which love and follow next
and of thi see merit is the measur
which is brought forth by grace and by good will
thu on from grade to grade doth it proce
the second triad which is germin
in such wise in thi sempitern spring
that no nocturn ari despoil
perpetu hosanna warbl forth
with threefold melodi that sound in three
order of joi with which it is intrin
the three divin ar in thi hierarchi
first the dominion and the virtu next
and the third order is that of the power
then in the danc twain penultim
the princip and archangel wheel
the last is wholli of angel sport
these order upward all of them ar gaze
and downward so prevail that unto god
thei all attract ar and all attract
and dionysiu with so great desir
to contempl these order set himself
he name them and distinguish them as i do
but gregori afterward dissent from him
wherefor as soon as he unclos hi ey
within thi heaven he at himself did smile
and if so much of secret truth a mortal
proffer on earth i would not have thee marvel
for he who saw it here reveal it to him
with much more of the truth about these circl

more than by problem of hi theme wa ever
oercom the comic or the tragic poet
for as the sun the sight that trembl most
even so the memori of that sweet smile
my mind depriveth of it veri self
from the first dai that i beheld her face
in thi life to the moment of thi look
the sequenc of my song ha neer been sever
but now perforc thi sequenc must desist
from follow her beauti with my vers
as everi artist at hi uttermost
such as i leav her to a greater fame
than ani of my trumpet which is bring

with voic and gestur of a perfect leader
she recommenc we from the greatest bodi

light intellectu replet with love
love of true good replet with ecstasi
ecstasi that transcendeth everi sweet
here shalt thou see the on host and the other

which at the final judgment thou shalt see
even as a sudden lightn that dispers
the visual spirit so that it depriv
the ey of impress from the strongest object
thu round about me flash a live light
and left me swath around with such a veil
of it effulg that i noth saw
ever the love which quieteth thi heaven
welcom into itself with such salut
to make the candl readi for it flame
no sooner had within me these brief word
an entranc found than i perceiv myself
to be uplift over my own power
and i with vision new rekindl me
such that no light whatev is so pure
but that mine ey were fortifi against it
and light i saw in fashion of a river
fulvid with it effulg twixt two bank
depict with an admir spring
out of thi river issu live spark
and on all side sank down into the flower
like unto rubi that ar set in gold
and then as if inebri with the odour
thei plung again into the wondrou torrent
and as on enter issu forth anoth
the high desir that now inflam and move thee
to have intellig of what thou seest
pleaseth me all the more the more it swell
but of thi water it behov thee drink
befor so great a thirst in thee be slake
thu said to me the sunshin of mine ey

not that these thing ar difficult in themselv
but the defici is on thy side
for yet thou hast not vision so exalt
there is no babe that leap so suddenli
with face toward the milk if he awak
much later than hi usual custom is
as i did that i might make better mirror
still of mine ey down stoop to the wave
which flow that we therein be better made
and even as the penthous of mine eyelid
drank of it it forthwith appear to me
out of it length to be transform to round
then as a folk who have been under mask
seem other than befor if thei divest
the semblanc not their own thei disappear in

the floweret and the spark so that i saw
both of the court of heaven made manifest
o splendour of god by mean of which i saw
the lofti triumph of the realm veraci
give me the power to sai how it i saw
there is a light abov which visibl
make the creator unto everi creatur

and it expand itself in circular form
to such extent that it circumfer
would be too larg a girdl for the sun

reflect from the top of primal motion
which take therefrom vital and power
and as a hill in water at it base
mirror itself as if to see it beauti
when affluent most in verdur and in flower
so rang aloft all round about the light

so great a light how vast the amplitud

even as a swarm of bee that sink in flower

no snow unto that limit doth attain

thei carri someth of the peac and ardour
which by the fan of their flank thei won

becaus the light divin so penetr
the univers accord to it merit
that naught can be an obstacl against it
thi realm secur and full of gladsom
crowd with ancient peopl and with modern

o trinal light that in a singl star

and if thou lookest up to the third round
of the first rank again shalt thou behold her
upon the throne her merit have assign her
without repli i lift up mine ey
and saw her as she made herself a crown
reflect from herself the etern rai
not from that region which the highest thunder
is ani mortal ey so far remov
in whatsoev sea it deepest sink

o ladi thou in whom my hope is strong

of whatsoev thing i have beheld

will not be known to thee by keep ever
thine ey below here on the lowest place
but mark the circl to the most remot
until thou shalt behold enthron the queen
to whom thi realm is subject and devot
i lift up mine ey and as at morn

from that time forward what i saw wa greater

o light suprem that dost so far uplift thee
from the conceit of mortal to my mind
of what thou didst appear relend a littl
and make my tongu of so great puissanc
that but a singl sparkl of thy glori
it mai bequeath unto the futur peopl
for by return to my memori somewhat
and by a littl sound in these vers
more of thy victori shall be conceiv
i think the keen of the live rai
which i endur would have bewild me
if but mine ey had been avert from it
and i rememb that i wa more bold
on thi account to bear so that i join
my aspect with the glori infinit
o grace abund by which i presum
to fix my sight upon the light etern
so that the see i consum therein
i saw that in it depth far down is ly
bound up with love togeth in on volum
what through the univers in leav is scatter
substanc and accid and their oper
all interfus togeth in such wise
that what i speak of is on simpl light
the univers fashion of thi knot
methink i saw sinc more abundantli
in sai thi i feel that i rejoic
on moment is more lethargi to me
than five and twenti centuri to the empris
that startl neptun with the shade of argo
my mind in thi wise wholli in suspens
steadfast immov attent gaze
and evermor with gaze grew enkindl
in presenc of that light on such becom
that to withdraw therefrom for other prospect
it is imposs he eer consent
becaus the good which object is of will
is gather all in thi and out of it
that is defect which is perfect there
shorter henceforward will my languag fall
of what i yet rememb than an infant
who still hi tongu doth moisten at the breast
not becaus more than on unmingl semblanc
wa in the live light on which i look
for it is alwai what it wa befor
but through the sight that fortifi itself
in me by look on appear onli
to me wa ever chang as i chang
within the deep and lumin subsist
of the high light appear to me three circl
of threefold colour and of on dimens
and by the second seem the first reflect
as iri is by iri and the third
seem fire that equal from both is breath
o how all speech is feebl and fall short
of my conceit and thi to what i saw
is such ti not enough to call it littl
o light etern sole in thyself that dwellest
sole knowest thyself and known unto thyself
and know lovest and smilest on thyself
that circul which be thu conceiv
appear in thee as a reflect light
when somewhat contempl by mine ey
within itself of it own veri colour
seem to me paint with our effigi
wherefor my sight wa all absorb therein
as the geometrician who endeavour
to squar the circl and discov not
by take thought the principl he want
even such wa i at that new apparit
i wish to see how the imag to the circl
conform itself and how it there find place
but my own wing were not enough for thi
had it not been that then my mind there smote
a flash of lightn wherein came it wish
here vigour fail the lofti fantasi
but now wa turn my desir and will
even as a wheel that equal is move
the love which move the sun and the other star
appendix
six sonnet on dant divin comedi by henri wadsworth longfellow
18071882
i
oft have i seen at some cathedr door
a labor paus in the dust and heat
lai down hi burden and with rever feet
enter and cross himself and on the floor
kneel to repeat hi paternost oer
far off the nois of the world retreat
the loud vocifer of the street
becom an undistinguish roar
so as i enter here from dai to dai
and leav my burden at thi minster gate
kneel in prayer and not asham to prai
the tumult of the time disconsol
to inarticul murmur di awai
while the etern ag watch and wait
ii
how strang the sculptur that adorn these tower
thi crowd of statu in whose fold sleev
bird build their nest while canopi with leav
parvi and portal bloom like trellis bower
and the vast minster seem a cross of flower
but fiend and dragon on the gargoyl eav
watch the dead christ between the live thiev
and underneath the traitor juda lower
ah from what agoni of heart and brain
what exult trampl on despair
what tender what tear what hate of wrong
what passion outcri of a soul in pain
upros thi poem of the earth and air
thi mediaev miracl of song
iii
i enter and i see thee in the gloom
of the long aisl o poet saturnin
and strive to make my step keep pace with thine
the air is fill with some unknown perfum
the congreg of the dead make room
for thee to pass the votiv taper shine
like rook that haunt ravenna grove of pine
the hover echo fly from tomb to tomb
from the confession i hear aris
rehears of forgotten tragedi
and lament from the crypt below
and then a voic celesti that begin
with the pathet word although your sin
as scarlet be and end with as the snow
iv
with snowwhit veil and garment as of flame
she stand befor thee who so long ago
fill thy young heart with passion and the woe
from which thy song in all it splendor came
and while with stern rebuk she speak thy name
the ic about thy heart melt as the snow
on mountain height and in swift overflow
come gush from thy lip in sob of shame
thou makest full confess and a gleam
as of the dawn on some dark forest cast
seem on thy lift forehead to increas
leth and eunoeth rememb dream
and the forgotten sorrowbr at last
that perfect pardon which is perfect peac
v
i lift mine ey and all the window blaze
with form of saint and holi men who di
here martyr and hereaft glorifi
and the great rose upon it leav displai
christ triumph and the angel roundelai
with splendor upon splendor multipli
and beatric again at dant side
no more rebuk but smile her word of prais
and then the organ sound and unseen choir
sing the old latin hymn of peac and love
and benedict of the holi ghost
and the melodi bell among the spire
oer all the housetop and through heaven abov
proclaim the elev of the host
vi
o star of morn and of liberti
o bringer of the light whose splendor shine
abov the dark of the apennin
forerunn of the dai that is to be
the voic of the citi and the sea
the voic of the mountain and the pine
repeat thy song till the familiar line
ar footpath for the thought of itali
thy fame is blown abroad from all the height
through all the nation and a sound is heard
as of a mighti wind and men devout
stranger of rome and the new proselyt
in their own languag hear thy wondrou word
and mani ar amaz and mani doubt
