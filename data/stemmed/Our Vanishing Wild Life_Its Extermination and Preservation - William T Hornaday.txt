foreword
the preserv of anim and plant life and of the gener beauti
of natur is on of the foremost duti of the men and women of
todai it is an imper duti becaus it must be perform at
onc for otherwis it will be too late everi possibl mean of
preservationsentiment educ and legislativemust be
emploi
the present warn issu with no uncertain sound becaus thi great
battl for preserv and conserv cannot be won by gentl tone
nor by appeal to the aesthet instinct of those who have no sens of
beauti or enjoy of natur it is necessari to sound a loud alarm
to present the fact in veri strong languag back up by irrefut
statist and by photograph which tell no li to establish the law
and enforc it if need be with a bludgeon
thi book is such an alarm call it forc page remind me of the
sound of the great bell in the watchtow of the citi of the
middl ag which call the citizen to arm to protect their home
their liberti and their happi it is undeni that the welfar
and happi of our own and of all futur gener of american ar
at stake in thi battl for the preserv of natur against the
selfish the ignor or the cruelti of her destroy
we no longer destroi great work of art thei ar treasur and
regard as of priceless valu but we have yet to attain the state of
civil where the destruct of a gloriou work of natur whether
it be a cliff a forest or a speci of mammal or bird is regard
with equal abhorr the whole earth is a poorer place to live in when
a coloni of exquisit egret or bird of paradis is destroi in order
that the plume mai decor the hat of some ladi of fashion and
ultim find their wai into the rubbish heap the peopl of all the
new england state ar poorer when the ignor white foreign or
negro of our southern state destroi the robin and other song bird
of the north for a mess of pottag
travel through europ as well as over a larg part of the north
american contin have convinc me that nowher is natur be
destroi so rapidli as in the unit state except within our
conserv area an earthli paradis is be turn into an earthli
hade and it is not savag nor primit men who ar do thi but
men and women who boast of their civil air and water ar
pollut river and stream serv as sewer and dump ground
forest ar swept awai and fish ar driven from the stream mani
bird ar becom extinct and certain mammal ar on the verg of
extermin vulgar advertis hide the landscap and in all
that disfigur the wonder heritag of the beauti of natur todai
we american ar in the lead
fortun the tide of destruct is eb and the tide of
conserv is come in american ar practic like all other
northern peopl thei love monei and will sacrific much for it but
thei ar also full of ideal as well as of moral and spiritu
energi the influenc of the splendid bodi of american and canadian
who have turn their best forc of mind and languag into literatur
and into polit power for the conserv movement is becom
stronger everi dai yet we ar far from the point where the momentum of
conserv is strong enough to arrest and roll back the tide of
destruct and thi is especi true with regard to our fast
vanish anim life
the fact and figur set forth in thi volum will astonish all those
lover of natur and friend of the anim world who ar live in a
fals or imaginari sens of secur the logic of these fact is
inexor as regard our bird and mammal the failur of suppos
protect in americaund a system of free shootingar so glare
that we ar confid thi exposur will lead to sweep reform the
author of thi work is no amateur in the field of wildlif protect
hi idea concern method of reform ar drawn from long and
success experi the state which ar still behind in thi
movement mai well give seriou heed to hi summon and pass the new
law that ar so urgent demand to save the vanish remnant
the new york zoolog societi which is cooper with mani other
organ in thi great movement send forth thi work in the
belief that there is no on who is more ardent devot to the great
caus or render more effect servic in it than william t
hornadai we believ that thi is a great book destin to exert a
worldwid influenc to be translat into other languag and to
arous the defend and lover of our vanish anim life befor it
is too late
henri fairfield osborn
10 decemb 1912 presid of the new york zoolog societi
prefac
the write of thi book ha taught me mani thing beyond question we
ar extermin our finest speci of mammal bird and fish
accord to law
i am appal by the mass of evid prove that throughout the entir
unit state and canada in everi state and provinc the exist
legal system for the preserv of wild life is fatal defect
there is not a singl state in our countri from which the killabl game
is not be rapidli and persist shot to death legal or
illeg veri much more rapidli than it is breed with
extermin for the most of it close in sight thi statement is not
open to argument for million of men know that it is liter true we
ar live in a fool paradis
the rage for wildlif slaughter is far more preval todai throughout
the world than it wa in 1872 when the buffalo butcher pave the
prairi of texa and colorado with fester carcass from on end of
our contin to the other there is a restless resistless desir to
kill kill
i have been shock by the accumul of evid show that all
over our countri and canada fulli ninetenth of our protect law
have practic been dictat by the killer of the game and that in
all save a veri few instanc the hunter have been exceedingli care
to provid open season for slaughter as long as ani game remain to
kill
and yet the game of north america doe not belong wholli and
exclus to the men who kill the other ninetyseven per cent of the
peopl have vest right in it far exceed those of the three per
cent poster ha claim upon it that no honest man can ignor
i am now go to ask both the true sportsman and the peopl who do not
kill wild thing to awak and do their plain duti in protect and
preserv the game and other wild life which belong partli to us but
chiefli to those who come after us can thei be arous befor it is
too late
the time to discuss tiresom academ theori regard bag limit
and differ open season as be suffici to preserv the game
ha gone by we have reach the point where the altern ar long
close season or a gameless contin and we must choos on or the
other speedili a contin without wild life is like a forest with no
leav on the tree
the great increas in the slaughter of song bird for food by the
negro and poor white of the south ha becom an unbear scourg
to our migratori birdsth veri bird on which farmer north and south
depend for protect from the insect hordesth veri bird that ar
most near and dear to the peopl of the north songbird slaughter is
grow and spread with the decreas of the game bird it is a
matter that requir instant attent and stern repress at the
present moment it seem that the onli remedi li in feder protect
for all migratori birdsbecaus so mani state will not do their duti
we ar weari of wit the greed selfish and cruelti of
civil man toward the wild creatur of the earth we ar sick of
tale of slaughter and pictur of carnag it is time for a sweep
reform and that is precis what we now demand
i have been a sportsman myself but time have chang and we must
chang also when game wa plenti i believ that it wa right for
men and boi to kill a limit amount of it for sport and for the tabl
but the old basi ha been swept awai by an armi of destruct that now
is almost beyond all control we must awak and arous to the new
situat face it like men and adjust our mind to the new condit
the three million gunner of todai must no longer expect or demand the
same gener hunt privileg that were right for hunter fifti year
ago when game wa fifti time as plenti as it is now and there wa
onli on killer for everi fifti now in the field
the fatalist idea that baglimit law can save the game is todai the
curs of all our game bird mammal and fish it is a fraud a
delus and a snare that miser fetish ha been worship much too
long our game is be extermin everywher by blind insist
upon open season and solemn relianc upon legal baglimit if a
major of the peopl of america feel that so long as there is ani game
aliv there must be an annual two month or four month open season for
it slaughter then assuredli we soon will have a gameless contin
the onli thing that will save the game is by stop the kill of it
in establish and promulg thi principl the caus of wildlif
protect greatli need three thing monei labor and public with
the first we can secur the second and third but can we get itand
get it in time to save
thi volum is in everi sens a contribut to a caus and as such it
ever will remain i wish the public to receiv it on that basi so much
import materi ha drift straight to it from other hand that thi
unexpect aid seem to the author like a good omen
the manuscript ha receiv the benefit of a close and critic read
and correct by my comrad on the firinglin and esteem friend mr
madison grant through which the text wa greatli improv but for the
splendid encourag and assist that i have receiv from him and
from professor henri fairneld osborn the work involv would have born
down rather heavili
the four chapter embrac the new law need a rollcal of the
state were critic inspect correct and brought down to date
by dr ts palmer our highest author on the game law of the nation
and the state for thi valuabl servic the author is deepli grate
of cours the author is alon respons for all the opinion and
conclus herein record and for all error that appear outsid of
quotat
i trust that the reader will kindli excus and forget all the
typograph and cleric error that mai have escap me in the rush
that had to be made against time

chapter i
the former abund of wild life
by my labor my vineyard flourish but ahab came ala for naboth
in order that the american peopl mai correctli understand and judg the
question of the extinct or preserv of our wild life it is
necessari to recal the near past it is not necessari howev to go
far into the detail of histori for a few quick glanc at a few high
point will be quit suffici for the purpos in view
ani man who read the book which best tell the stori of the develop
of the american coloni of 1712 into the american nation of 1912 and
take due note of the wildlif featur of the tale will sai without
hesit that when the american peopl receiv thi land from the
bounti hand of natur it wa endow with a magnific and
allpervad suppli of valuabl wild creatur the pioneer and the
earli settler were too busi even to take due note of that fact or to
comment upon it save in veri fragmentari wai
nevertheless the wildlif abund of earli american dai surviv
down to so late a period that it touch the live of million of peopl
now live ani man 55 year of ag who when a boi had a tast for
huntingfor at that time there were no sportsmen in americawil
rememb the flock and herd of wild creatur that he saw and which
made upon hi mind mani indel impress
abund is the word with which to describ the origin anim life
that stock our countri and all north america onli a short
halfcenturi ago throughout everi state on everi shorelin in all
the million of fresh water lake pond and river on everi mountain
rang in everi forest and even on everi desert the wild flock and
herd held swai it wa imposs to go beyond the settl haunt of
civil man and escap them
it wa a full centuri after the complet settlement of new england and
the virginia coloni that the wonder biggam fauna of the great
plain and rocki mountain wa realli discov but the bison
million the antelop million the mule deer the mountain sheep and
mountain goat were there all the time in the earli dai the million
of pinnat grous and quail of the central state attract no seriou
attent from the american peopleatlarg but thei live and
flourish just the same far down in the seventi when the greedi
market gunner systemat slaughter them and barrel them up for
the market while the foolish farmer calmli permit them to do it
we obtain the best of our histori of the former abund of north
american wild life first from the page of audubon and wilson next
from the record left by such pioneer as lewi and clark and last from
the testimoni of live men to all thi we can mani of us add
observ of our own
to me the most strike fact that stand forth in the stori of american
wild life on hundr year ago is the wide extent and thorough of
it distribut wide as our countri is and marvel as it is in the
divers of it climat it soil it topographi it flora it
rich and it poverti natur gave to each squar mile and to each acr
a gener quota of wild creatur accord to it abil to maintain
live thing no pioneer ever push so far or into region so
difficult or so remot that he did not find await him a host of
bird and beast sometim the pioneer wa not a good hunter usual
he wa a stupid fisherman but the game wa there nevertheless the
time wa when everi farm had it quota
the part that the wild life of america plai in the settlement and
develop of thi contin wa so farreach in extent and so
enorm in potenti valu that it fairli stagger the imagin
from the land of the pilgrim down to the present hour the wild game
ha been the mainstai and the resourc against starvat of the
pathfind the settler the prospector and at time even the
railroadbuild in view of what the bison million did for the
dakota montana wyom kansa and texa it is onli right and squar
that those state should now do someth for the perpetu preserv
of the bison speci and all other big game that need help
for year and year the antelop million of the montana and wyom
grassland fed the scout and indianfight freighter cowboi and
surveyor ranchman and sheepherd but thu far i have yet to hear
of on western state that ha ever spent on penni directli for the
preserv of the antelop and todai we ar in a handtohand fight
in congress and in montana with the woolgrow associ which
maintain in washington a keen lobbyist to keep aloft the tariff on
wool and prevent congress from take 15 squar mile of grass land on
snow creek montana for a nation antelop preserv all that the
woolgrow want is the entir earth all to themselv mr mcclure
the secretari of the associ sai
the proper place in which to preserv the big game of the west is in
citi park where it can be protect
to the colonist of the east and pioneer of the west the whitetail
deer wa an ever present help in time of troubl without thi
omnipres anim and the suppli of good meat that each white flag
repres the commissariat difficulti of the settler who won the
countri as far westward as indiana would have been mani time greater
than thei were the backwood pilgrim progress wa like thi
trail deer cabin deer clear bear corn deer hog deer
cattl wheat independ
and yet how mani men ar there todai out of our nineti million of
american and pseudoamerican who rememb with ani feel of
gratitud the part plai in american histori by the whitetail deer
veri few how mani american ar there in our land who now preserv that
deer for sentiment reason and becaus hi forbear were
nationbuild as a matter of fact ar there ani
on everi eastern pioneer monument the whitetail deer should
figur and on those of the great west the bison and the antelop
should be cast in endur bronz lest we forget
the game bird of america plai a differ part from that of the deer
antelop and bison in the earli dai shotgun were few and shot wa
scarc and dear the wild turkei and goos were the smallest bird on
which a rifleman could afford to expend a bullet and a whole charg of
powder it wa for thi reason that the deer bear bison and elk
disappear from the eastern unit state while the game bird yet
remain abund with the disappear of the big game came the fat
steer hog and homini the wheatfield fruit orchard and poultri
galor
the game bird of america as a class and a mass have not been swept
awai to ward off starvat or to rescu the perish even back in the
sixti and seventi veri veri few men of the north thought of
kill prairi chicken duck and quail snipe and woodcock in order
to keep the hunger wolf from the door the process wa too slow and
uncertain and besid the reallypoor man rare had the gun and
ammunit instead of attempt to live on bird he hustl for the
stapl food product that the soil of hi own farm could produc
first last and nearli all the time the game bird of the unit state
as a whole have been sacrif on the altar of rank luxuri to tempt
appetit that were tire of fri chicken and other farm delicaci
todai even the averag poor man hunt bird for the joi of the out
and the pamper epicur of the hotel and restaur bui game bird
and eat small portion of them sole to tempt jade appetit if
there is such a thing as class legisl it is that which permit a
few sordid marketshoot to slaughter the bird of the whole peopl in
order to sell them to a few epicur
the game of a state belong to the whole peopl of the state the
suprem court of the unit state ha so decid geer vs
connecticut if it is abund it is a valuabl asset the great valu
of the game bird of america li not in their meat pound as thei lie
upon the tabl but in the temptat thei annual put befor million
of fieldweari farmer and deskweari clerk and merchant to get into
their belov hunt tog stalk out into the lap of natur and sai
begon dull care
and the man who ha had a fine dai in the paint wood on the bright
water of a duckhaunt bai or in the golden stubbl of septemb can
fill hi dai and hi soul with six good bird just as well as with
sixti the idea that in order to enjoi a fine dai in the open a man must
kill a wheelbarrow load of bird is a mistaken idea and if
obstin adher to it becom viciou the out in the open is
the thingnot the bloodstain feather nasti viscera and death in
the gamebag on quail on a fenc is worth more to the world than ten
in a bag
the farmer of america have by their own supin and lack of
foresight permit the slaughter of a stock of game bird which had
it been properli and wise conserv would have furnish a good
annual shoot to everi farm man and boi of sport instinct through
the past right down to the present and far beyond thei have allow
million of dollar worth of their bird to be coolli snatch awai
from them by the greedi marketshoot
there is on state in america and so far as i know onli on in which
there is at thi moment an oldtim abund of gamebird life that is
the state of louisiana the reason is not so veri far to seek for the
bird that do not migratequail wild turkei and dovesth cover is
yet abund for the migratori game bird of the mississippi vallei
louisiana is a grand central depot with termin facil that ar
unsurpass her reedi shore her vast marsh her long coast line and
abund of food furnish what should be not onli a haven but a heaven
for duck and gees after run the gauntlet of gun all the wai from
manitoba and ontario to the sunk land of arkansa the shore of the
gulf must seem like heaven itself
the great forest of louisiana shelter deer turkei and furbear
anim galor and rabbit and squirrel abound
natur thi abund of game ha given rise to an extens
industri in shoot for the market the big interest outsid the
state send their agent into the best game district often bring in
their own forc of shooter thei comb out the game in enorm
quantiti without leav to the peopl of louisiana ani decent and
fair quidproquo for have despoil them of their game and ship a
vast annual product outsid to creat wealth elsewher
at present howev we ar but incident interest in the
shortsighted of the peopl of the pelican state as a state of
oldtim abund in killabl game the kill record that were kept
in the year 190910 possess for us veri great interest thei throw a

of the thousand of slaughter robin it would seem that no record
exist it is to be understood that the annual slaughter of wild life in
louisiana never befor reach such a pitch as now without drastic
measur what will be the inevit result doe ani man suppos that
even the wild million of louisiana can long withstand such slaughter as
that shown by the offici figur given abov it is wildli imposs
but the darkest hour is just befor the dawn at the session of the
louisiana legislatur that wa held in the spring of 1912 great
improv were made in the game law of that state the most
import featur wa the suppress of wholesal market hunt by
person who ar not resid of the state a veri limit amount of
game mai be sold and serv as food in public place but the
restrict place upon thi traffic ar so effect that thei will
vastli reduc the annual slaughter in other respect also the caus
of wild life protect gain much for which great credit is due to
mr edward a mcilhenni
it is the wai of american to feel that becaus game is abund in a
given place at a given time it alwai will be abund and mai
therefor be slaughter without limit that wa the case last winter in
california dure the aw slaughter of bandtail pigeon as will be
note elsewher
it is time for all men to be told in the plainest term that there never
ha exist anywher in histor time a volum of wild life so great
that civil man could not quickli extermin it by hi method of
destruct lift the veil and look at the stori of the bison the
passeng pigeon the wild duck and shore bird of the atlant coast
and the furseal
illustr shall we leav ani on of them open
as reason be it is our duti to heed the lesson of histori and
not rush blindli on until we perpetr a contin destitut of wild
life
chapter ii
extinct speci of north american bird
for educ civil man to extermin a valuabl wild speci of
live thing is a crime it is a crime against hi own children and
poster
no man ha a right either moral or legal to destroi or squander an
inherit of hi children that he hold for them in trust and man
the wast and greedi spendthrift that he is ha not creat even the
humblest of the speci of bird mammal and fish that adorn and
enrich thi earth the earth is the lord and the ful thereof
with all hi wisdom man ha not evolv and place here so much as a
groundsquirrel a sparrow or a clam it is true that he ha juggl
with the wild hors and sheep the goat and the swine and produc
some hardi breed that can withstand hi abus without go down befor
it but as for speci he ha not yet creat and place here even so
much as a protozoan
the wild thing of thi earth ar not our to do with as we pleas
thei have been given to us in trust and we must account for them to
the gener which will come after us and audit our account
but man the shameless destroy of natur gift blith and
persist extermin on speci after anoth fulli ten per cent
of the human race consist of peopl who will lie steal throw rubbish
in park and destroi forest and wild life whenev and wherev thei
can do so without be stop by a policemen and a club these ar
hard word but thei ar absolut true from ten per cent or more of
the human race the high moral instinct which is honest without
compuls is absent the thing that seemingli decent citizensmen
pose as gentlemenwil do to wild game when thei secur great
chanc to slaughter ar appal i could fill a book of thi size
with case in point
todai the women of england europ and elsewher ar directli promot
the extermin of score of beauti speci of wild bird by the
devilish persist with which thei bui and wear feather ornament made
of their plumag thei ar just as mean and cruel as the truckdriv
who drive a hors with a sore shoulder and beat him on the street but
thei do it and appeal to them to do otherwis thei laugh to scorn
sai i will wear what is fashion when i pleas and where i
pleas as a famou bird protector of england ha just written me the
women of the smart set ar beyond the reach of appeal or protest
todai the thing that stare me in the face everi wake hour like a
grisli spectr with bloodi fang and claw is the extermin of
speci to me that is a horribl thing it is wholesal murder no

civil mankind i sai civil mankind becaus savag dont do
it
there ar three kind of extermin
the practic extermin of a speci mean the destruct of it
member to an extent so thorough and widespread that the speci
disappear from view and live specimen of it can not be found by
seek for them in north america thi is todai the statu of the
whoop crane upland plover and sever other speci if ani
individu ar live thei will be met with onli by accid
the absolut extermin of a speci mean that not on individu
of it remain aliv judgment to thi effect is base upon the laps of
time sinc the last live specimen wa observ or kill when five
year have pass without a live record of a wild specimen it is
time to place a speci in the class of the total extinct
extermin in a wild state mean that the onli live
repres ar in captiv or otherwis under protect thi is
the case of the heath hen and david deer of china the american bison
is save from be wholli extinct as a wild anim by the remnant of
about 300 head in northern athabasca and 49 head in the yellowston
park
it is a seriou thing to extermin a speci of ani of the vertebr
anim there ar probabl million of peopl who do not realiz that
civil man is the most persist and wickedli wast of all
the predatori anim the lion the tiger the bear the eagl and
hawk serpent and the fisheat fish all live by destroi
life but thei kill onli what thei think thei can consum if someth
is by chanc left over it goe to satisfi the hunger of the humbler
creatur of prei in a state of natur where wild creatur prei upon
wild creatur such a thing as wanton wholesal and utterli wast
slaughter is almost unknown
when the wild mink weasel and skunk suddenli find himself in the midst
of score of man confin and helpless domest fowl or hi cage
gull in a zoolog park an unusu crimin passion to murder for
the joi of kill sometim seiz the wild anim and great slaughter
is the result
from the earliest histor time it ha been the wai of savag man
red black brown and yellow to kill as the wild anim doonli what
he can us or think he can us the cree indian impound small
herd of bison and sometim kill from 100 to 200 at on time but it
wa to make sure of have enough meat and hide and becaus he
expect to us the product i think that even the worst enemi of the
plain indian hardli will accus them of kill larg number of
bison elk or deer mere for the pleasur of see them fall or
take onli their teeth

it ha remain for the wolf the sheepkil dog and civil man to
make record of wanton slaughter which put them in a class togeth
and quit apart from other predatori anim when a man can kill bison
for their tongu alon bull elk for their tusk alon and shoot a
whole coloni of hippopotamiactu dam a river with their
bloat and putrid carcass all untouch by the knifeth men who
do such thing must be class with the cruel wolf and the crimin dog
it is now desir that we should paus in our career of destruct
long enough to look back upon what we have recent accomplish in the
total extinct of speci and also note what we have block out for
the immedi futur here let us erect a monument to the dead speci
of our own time
it is to be doubt whether up to thi hour ani man ha made a list of
the speci of north american bird that have becom extinct dure the
past sixti year the specialist have no time to spare from their
compound differenti microscop and the birdkil ar too busi
with shoot net and club to wast ani time on such trifl as
extermin speci what doe a marketshoot care about bird that
can not be kill a second time as for the farmer thei ar so busi
rais hog and price that their best friend the bird get scant
attent from themuntil a henhawk take a chicken
down south the negro and poor white mai slaughter robin for food by
the ten thousand but doe the northern farmer bother hi head about a
trifl of that kind no inde will he contribut ani real monei to
help put a stop to it ask him yourself
let us paus long enough to reckon up some of our expenditur in
speci and in million of individu let us set down here in cold
blood a list of the speci of our own north american bird that have
been total extermin in our own time after that we will have
someth to sai about other speci that soon will be extermin and
the second task is much greater than the first
roll call of the dead speci of american bird

spent sever month slaughter great auk and try out their fat

to form a rough estim of the daili consumpt of on of these

of on mile in a minut four hour the time it continu pass
would make it whole length two hundr and forti mile again
suppos that each squar yard of thi move bodi comprehend three

in 1867 the state of new york found that the wild pigeon need

for the sandhil crane is not in the same class as the white black and
blue giant of asia we will part from our state gru americanu
with profound sorrow for on thi contin we neer shall see hi like

the wellnigh total disappear of thi speci ha been brought close
home to us by the fact that there ar less than half a dozen individu
aliv in captiv while in a wild state the bird is so rare as to be
quit unobtain for exampl for nearli five year an english
gentlemen ha been offer 1000 for a pair and the most

i know not how other naturalist regard the futur of the three speci

quickli stop as to wild plumag thei ar absolut certain to be
shot into total oblivion within a veri few year the plumag of these
bird ha so much commerci valu for fishermen fli as well as for
women hat that the bird will be kill as long as their feather

illustr california condor
now live in the new york zoolog park
on order to obtain the best and also the most conserv inform
regard thi speci i appeal to the curat of the museum of
vertebr zoologi of the univers of california although written in
the mountain wild i promptli receiv the valuabl contribut that
appear below as a clear precis and conserv survei of an
import speci it is realli a model document
the statu of the california condor in 1912 by joseph grinnel
to my knowledg the california condor ha been definit observ
within the past five year in the follow california counti lo
angel ventura santa barbara san lui obispo monterei kern and
tular in part of ventura santa barbara san lui obispo and kern
counti the speci is still fairli common for a larg bird probabl
equal in number to the golden eagl in those region that ar suit to
it by suitabl countri i mean cattlerais mountain territori
of which there ar still vast area and which ar not like to be put
to ani other us for a veri long time if ever on account of the lack
of water
while in kern counti last april i wa inform by a reliabl man who
live near the tejon rancho that he had count twentyf condor in a
singl dai sinc januari 1 of the present year these were on the tejon
rancho which is an enorm cattl rang cover part of the
tehachapi and san emigdio mountain
our present state law provid complet protect for the condor and
it egg and the state fish and game commiss in grant permit
for collector alwai add the phraseexcept the california condor
and it egg i know of two special permit have been issu but
neither of these were us that is no specimen have been taken
sinc 1908 as far as i am awar
in my travel about the state i have found that practic everyon
know that the condor is protect still there is alwai the hunt
element who do not hesit to shoot anyth aliv and out of the
ordinari and a certain percentag of the condor ar doubtless pick
off each year by such crimin it is possibl also that the
mercenari eggcollector continu to take hi annual rent though if
thi is done it is kept veri quiet it is my impress that the present
fatal from all sourc ar fulli balanc by the natur rate of
increas
there is on factor that ha milit against the condor more than ani
other on thing name the restrict in it food sourc it forag
rang formerli includ most of the great vallei adjac to it
mountain retreat but now the vallei ar almost entir devot to
agricultur and of cours far more thickli settl than formerli
the mountain area where the condor is make it last stand seem to
me like to remain adapt to the bird exist for mani
yearsfifti year if not longer of cours thi is condit upon
the mainten and enforc of the present law there is also the
enlighten of public sentiment in regard to the preserv of wild
life which i believ can be depend upon thi is a matter of gener
educ which is fortun and with no doubt whatev
progress at a quit percept rate
ye i should sai that the condor ha a fair chanc to surviv in
limit number
anoth bird which in my opinion is far nearer extinct than the
condor so far as california is concern is the whitetail kite
thi is a perfectli harmless bird but on which harri over the
marsh where it ha been an easi target for the idl duckhunt
then too it rang wa limit to the vallei bottom where human
settlement is increasingli close i know of onli two live pair within
the state last year
final let me remark that the rate of increas of the california
condor is not on whit less than that of the bandtail pigeon yet
there is no protect at all for the latter in thi state even in the
nest season and thousand were shot last spring in the
unpreced concentr of the speci in the southern coast
counti see chamber in the condor for mai 1912 p 108
the california condor is on of the onli two speci of condor now
live and it is the onli on found in north america as a matter of
nation pride and a duti to poster the peopl of the unit state
can far better afford to lose a million dollar from their nation
treasuri than to allow that bird to becom extinct it preserv for
all come time is distinctli a white man burden upon the state of
california the law now in forc for the condor protect ar not
half adequ i think there is no law by which the accident poison
of those bird by bait put out for coyot and fox can be stop
a law to prevent the us of poison meat bait anywher in southern
california should be enact at the next session of california
legislatur the fine for molest a condor should be rais to 500
with a long prisonterm as an altern a compet interest game
warden should be appoint sole for the protect of the condor
it is time to count those bird keep them under observ and have
an annual report upon their condit

the ornithologist of massachusett and particularli dr georg w

pinnat grous would year ago have becom total extinct new york
new jersei and massachusett began to protect that speci entir too
late it wa given fiveyear close season without avail then it wa
given tenyear close season but it wa too late
todai the speci exist onli in on local the island of martha
vineyard and concern it present statu mr forbush ha recent
furnish us the follow clear statement
the heath hen increas for two year after the massachusett fish
and game commiss establish a reserv for them but in 1911
thei had not increas there ar probabl about two hundr bird
extant
i found a great mani marsh hawk on the island and the commiss
did not kill them believ them to be benefici in watch
them i conclud that thei were catch the young heath hen a
larg number of these hawk have been shot and their stomach sent
to washington for examin as i wa too busi at the time to
examin them so far as i know no report of the examin ha
been made but dr field himself examin a few of the stomach and
found the remain of the heath hen in some
the warden now sai that dure the past two year the heath hen
ha not increas but i can give you no definit evid of thi
i am quit sure thei ar be kill by nativ of the island and
that at least on collector suppli bird for museum we ar
try to get evid of thi
i believ if the heath hen is to be increas in number and brought
back to thi countri we shall have to have more than on warden on
the reserv and eventu we shall have to establish the bird
on the mainland also

rookeri ar try to studi out the line of flight of the bird to

a few month ago a nova scotian writer in forest and stream came out
with the bold predict that three more year of the usual annual
slaughter of woodcock will bring the speci to the verg of extinct
in that provinc
it is such occurr as thi that bring the end of a speci
last fall 1911 at norwalk conn we had a good flight of woodcock
and it is a shame the wai thei were slaughter i know of a number of
case where twenti were kill by on gun in the dai and heard of on
case of fifti thi is all wrong and mean the end of the woodcock if
continu there is no doubt we need a bag limit on woodcock as much as
on quail or partridg woodcock in forest and stream mar 2

as far back as 1901 dr ak fisher of the biolog survei predict
that the woodcock and woodduck would both becom extinct unless better

let not ani honest american or canadian sportsman lullabi himself into

illustr thylacin or tasmanian wolf

speci of larg mammal almost extinct
the thylacin or tasmanian wolf thylacinu cynocephalusfour
year ago when mr whd le souef director of the melbourn
zoolog garden australia stood befor the cage of the live
thylacin in the new york zoolog park he first express surpris
at the sight of the anim then said
i advis you to take excel care of that specimen for when it is
gone you never will get anoth the speci soon will be extinct
thi opinion ha been support quit independ by a ladi who is
the highest author on the present statu of that speci mr mari
g robert of hobart tasmania for nearli ten year mr robert ha
been procur all the live specimen of the thylacin that monei
could bui and attempt to breed them at her privat zoo she state
that the mountain home of thi anim is now occupi by flock of
sheep and becaus of the fact that the tasmanian wolv raid the
flock and kill lamb the sheepown and herder ar systemat
poison the thylacin as fast as possibl inasmuch as the speci is
limit to tasmania mr robert and other fear that the sheepmen
will total extermin the remnant at an earli date thi anim is
the largest and also the most interest carnivor marsupi of
australia and it untim end will be a caus for sincer regret
illustr west indian seal
in the new york aquarium
the west indian seal monachu tropicalisfor at least fifti
year all the zoologist who ever had heard of thi speci believ
that the oilhunt had complet extermin it in 1885 when the
nation museum came into possess of on poorlymount skin from
professor poei of havana it wa regard as a great prize
most unexpectedli in 1886 american zoologist were startl by the
discoveri of a small herd on the triangl island in the caribbean sea
near yucatan by mr henri l ward now director of the milwauke public
museum and professor ferrari of the nation museum of mexico thei
found about twenti specimen and collect onli a suffici number to
establish the true charact of the speci
sinc that time four live specimen have been captur and sent to
the new york aquarium where thei live for satisfactori period the
indoor life and atmospher did not seem to injur the natur vital
of the anim in fact i think thei were far more live in the
aquarium than were the sluggish creatur that mr ward saw on the
triangl reef and describ in hi report of the expedit
it is quit possibl that there ar yet aliv a few specimen of thi
odd speci but the damocletian sword of destruct hang over them
suspend by a fine hair and it is to be expect that in the futur
some rove sea adventur will pounc upon the remnant and wipe it
out of exist for whatev reason mai to him seem good

remark longsnout speci of seal wa reluctantli stricken from
the fauna of the unit state sever year ago and for at least
fifteen year it ha been regard as total extinct last year
howev 1911 the albatross scientif expedit under the control
of director ch townsend of the new york aquarium visit guadalup
island 175 mile off the pacif coast of lower california and there
found about 150 live eleph seal thei took six live specimen
all of which di after a few month in captiv ever sinc that time
first on person and then anoth come to the front with a cheer
proposit to go to those island and clean up all the remaind of
those wonder seal on hunt parti could land on guadalup and in
on week total destroi the last remnant of thi almost extinct
speci todai the onli question is who will be mean enough to do it
fortun those seal have no commerci valu whatsoev the littl
oil thei would yield would not pai the wage of cook mate the proven
imposs of keep specimen aliv in captiv even for on
year and the absenc of cash valu in the skin even for museum
purpos ha left noth of valu in the anim to justifi an
expedit to kill or to captur them no zoolog garden or park
desir ani of them at ani price adult male attain a length of
sixteen feet and femal eleven feet formerli thi speci wa
abund in san christob bai lower california
at present mexico is in no frame of mind to provid real protect to
a small coloni of seal of no commerci valu 175 mile from her
mainland on an uninhabit island it is wildli improb that those
seal will be permit to live it is a safe predict that our next

extinct of those last 140 survivor of the speci
the california grizzli bear ursu horribili californicusno on
protect grizzli bear except in the yellowston park and other game
preserv for obviou reason it is imposs to sai whether ani
individu of thi huge speci now remain aliv or how long it will
be until the last on fall befor a 405 winchest engin of
extermin we know that a live specimen can not be procur with
monei and we believ that old monarch now in golden gate park san
francisco is the last specimen of hi speci that ever will be
exhibit aliv
i can think of no reason save gener californian apathi why the
extinct of thi huge and remark anim wa not prevent by law
the sunset grizzli on a railroad track is the advertis emblem of
the golden state and sure the state should take suffici interest
in the speci to prevent it total extermin
but it will not california is hellbent on extermin a long list of

the regular armi of destruct
in order to cure ani diseas the surgeon must make of it a correct

understand of the troubl
that the best and most interest wild life of america is disappear
at a rapid rate we all know onli too well that proposit is entir
beyond the domain of argument the fact that a speci or a group of
speci ha made a littl gain here and there or is stationari doe
not sensibl diminish the forc of the descend blow the wildlif
situat is full of surpris for exampl in 1902 i wa astound by
the extent to which bird life had decreas over the 130 mile between

for ani civil nation to extermin valuabl and interest speci

of each unfortun it is imposs to segreg some of these
class and number each on for thei merg togeth too close for
that but we can at least describ the sever class that form the
great mass of destroy
the gentlemen sportsmenthes men ar the veri bone and sinew of wild
life preserv these ar the men who have red blood in their vein
who annual hear the red god call who love the earth the
mountain the wood the water and the sky these ar the men to whom
the bag is a matter of small import and to whom the baglimit
ha onli academ interest becaus in nine case out of ten thei do not
care to kill all that the law allow the tenth and except time is
when the bag limit is on a gentleman sportsman is a man who protect
game stop shoot when he ha enoughwithout refer to the
legal baglimit and whenev a speci is threaten with extinct
he conscienti refrain from shoot it
the true sportsmen of the world ar the men who onc were keen in the
stubbl or on the trail but who have been halt by the gener
slaughter and the aw decreas of game mani of them long befor a
hair ha turn grai have hung up their gun forev and turn to the
camera these ar the men who ar will to hand out check or to
leav their mirth and their employ and go to the fire line at
their state capitol to lock horn with the bullhead killer of wild
life who recogn no check or limit save the law
these ar the men who have done the most to put upon our statut book
the law that thu far have save some of our american game from total
annihil and who so we firmli believ will be chiefli
instrument in tighten the line of protect around the remnant
these ar the men who ar make and stock game preserv public and

the regular armi of destruct wait for the first of octob
each year 2642274 wellarm men take the field against the remnant

drawn by dan beard
if you wish to know some of these men i will tell you where to find a
goodli number of them and when you find them you will also find that
thei ar men you would enjoi camp with look in the membership list

clark club of pittsburgh the new york state leagu the shikar club of

british empir the massachusett fish and game protect associ
the springfield mass sportsmen associ the campfir club of
detroit and chicago and the north american fish and game protect
associ
there ar other bodi of sportsmen that i would like to name were
space avail but to set down here a complet list is quit
imposs
the best and the most of the gameprotect law now in forc in the
unit state and canada were brought into exist through the
initi and effort of the real sportsmen of those two nation but
for their activ exert on the right side the settl portion of
north america would todai be an utterli gameless land even though the
sportsmen have taken their toll of the wild thei have made the law
that have save a remnant of the game until 1912
for all that howev everi man who still shoot game is a soldier in
the armi of destruct there is no blink that fact such men do not
stand on the summit with the men who now protect the game and do not
shoot at all the million of men who do not shoot and who also do
noth to protect or preserv wild life do not count in thi warfar
thei ar mere cipher in front of the real figur
the gunner who kill to the limitout of the enorm mass of men who
annual take up arm against the remnant of wild life and ar call
sportsmen i believ that onli on out of everi 500 conscienti
stop shoot when game becom scarc and extinct is impend
all of the other feel that it is right and proper to kill all the game
that thei can kill up to the legal bag limit it is the reason of
shylock
justic demand it and the law doth give it
especi is thi true of the men who pai their on dollar per year
for a resid hunt licens and feel that in do so thei have done
a great big thing
thi is a veri deadli frame of mind ethic it is entir wrong
and at least two million men and boi who shoot american game must be
shown that it is wrong thi is the spirit of extermin cloth in
the robe of law and justic
whenev and wherev game bird ar so scarc that a good shot who
hunt hard dure a dai in the field find onli three or four bird he
should stop shoot at onc and devot hi mind and energi to the
problem of bring back the game it is strang that condit do not
make thi duti clear to everi conscienti citizen
the shylock spirit which prompt a man to kill all that the law allow
is a terribl scourg to the wild life of america and to the world at
larg it is the spirit of extermin accord to law even the
kill of game for the market is not so great a scourg as thi for
thi spirit search out the game in everi nook and cranni of the world
and spare not in effect it sai if the law is defect it is right
for me to take everi advantag of it i do not need to have ani
conscienc in the matter outsid the letter of the law
the extent to which thi amaz spirit prevail is posit aw
you will find it among pseudo gameprotector to a paralyz extent it
is the great gunner paradox and it pervad thi countri from corner
to corner no there is no us in try to educ the mass of the
hunter of america out of it as a mean of save the game for
posit it can not be done do not wast time in try it if you
reli upon it you will be do a great wrong to wild life and
promot extermin the onli remedi is sweep law for long
close season for a great mani speci forget the paltri
dollarayear licens monei the licens fee never repres more than
a tenth part of the valu of the game that is kill under licens
the savag desir to kill all that the law allow often is manifest
in men in whom we natur expect to find a veri differ spirit by
wai of illumin i offer three case out of the mani that i could
state
case no 1 the duck breedera gentleman of my acquaint ha
spent sever year and much monei in breed wild duck from my
relat with him i had acquir the belief that he wa a great lover
of duck and at least wish all speci well on whizz cold dai in
winter he call upon me and state that he had been duckhunt
which surpris me he ad i have just spent two dai on great south
bai and i made a great kill in the two dai i got ninetyfour
duck
i said how could you do itcar for wild duck as you do
well i had hunt duck twice befor on great south bai and didnt
have veri good luck but thi time the cold weather drove the duck in
and i got squar with them
case no 2 the ornithologista short time ago the new wa
publish in forest and stream that a wellknown ornithologist had
distinguish himself in on of the midwestern state by the skill he
had displai in bag thirtyfour duck in on dai greatli to the
envi of the nativ and if thi shoe fit ani american naturalist he
is welcom to put it on and wear it
case no 3 the sportsmana friend of mine in the south is the owner
of a game preserv in which wild duck ar at time veri numer onc
upon a time he wa visit by a northern sportsmen who take a deep and
abid interest in the preserv of game the sportsman wa invit
to go out duckshoot duck be then in season there he said
ye i will go and i want you to put me in a place where i can kill a
hundr duck in a dai i never have done that yet and i would like
to do it onc
all right said my friend i can put you in such a place and if you
can shoot well enough you can kill a hundr duck in a dai
the effort wa made in all earnest there wa much shoot but few
were the duck that fell befor it in conclud thi stori my friend
remark in a tone of disgust
all the gamepreserv sportsmen that come to me ar just like that
thei want to kill all thei can kill
there is a bloodtest by which to separ the conscienti sportsmen
from the mere gunner here it is
a sportsman stop shoot when game becom scarc and he doe not
object to longcloseseason law but
a gunner believ in kill all that the law allow and he
object to long close season
i warrant that whenev and wherev thi test is appli it will
separ the sheep from the goat it appli in all america all asia
and africa and in greenland with equal forc

reduc our game bird to a mere remnant of their former abund
there is no influenc so deadli to wild life as that of the market
gunner who work six dai a week from sunris until sunset hunt

greatest kill of which i ever have heard occur under the auspic of
the glenn counti club in southern california on februari 5 1906 two
men arm with automat shotgun fire five shot apiec and got
ten gees out of on flock in on hour thei kill two hundr and
eighteen gees and their bag for the dai wa four hundr and fifti
gees the shooter who wrote the stori for public on februari 12
at willow glenn counti california said it be warm weather the
bird had to be ship at onc in order to keep them from spoil a
photograph wa made of the on hour slaughter of two hundr and
eighteen gees and it wa publish in a western magazin with
chb stori nearli all of which will be found in chapter xv
the reason why market shoot is so deadli destruct to wild life
ar not obscur
the true sportsman hunt dure a veri few dai onli each year the
market gunner shoot earli and late six dai a week month after month
when game is abund the price is low and a great quantiti must be
kill in order to make it pai well when game is scarc the market
price ar high and the shooter make the utmost exert to find the
last of the game in order to secur the big monei
when game is protect by law thousand of peopl with monei desir it
for their tabl just the same and ar will to pai fabul price
for what thei want when thei want it mani a dealer is quit will to
run the risk of fine becaus fine dont realli hurt thei ar onli
annoi the dealer wish to make the big profit and retain hi
custom and besid he reason if i dont suppli him some on

when game is scarc price high and the consum monei readi there
ar a hundr trick to which shooter and dealer willingli resort to

of their own protect game but twenti of them do not expressli
prohibit the sale of game stolen from neighbor state that is a
veri veri weak point in the law of all those state a child can see
how it work take pittsburgh as a case in point
in the winter and spring of 1912 the state game commiss of
pennsylvania found that quail and ruf grous were be sold in
pittsburgh in larg quantiti the state law were well enforc and
it wa believ that the bird were not be kill in pennsylvania
some other state wa be rob
the game commiss went to work and in a veri short time certain
gamedeal of pittsburgh were arrest at first thei tri to bluff
their wai out of their difficulti and even went as far as to bring
charg against the gamewarden whom the commiss had instruct to
bui some of their illeg game and pai for it but the net of the law
tighten upon them so quickli and so tightli that thei threw up their
hand and beg for merci
it wa found that those pittsburgh gamedeal were sell quail and
grous that had been stolen in thousand from the state of kentucki
between the state game law work in love harmoni with the lacei
feder law that prohibit the shipment of game illeg kill or
sold the whole bad busi wa laid bare and sign confess were
promptli obtain from the shipper in kentucki
at that veri time a good bill for the better protect of her game wa
befor the kentucki legislatur and a certain member wa vigor
oppos it as he had successfulli done in previou year he wa told
that the state wa be rob but refus to believ it then a
sign confess wa laid befor him bear the name of the man who
wa instig hi oppositionhi friendwho confess that he had
illeg bought and ship to pittsburgh over 5000 bird the
objector liter threw up hi hand and said i have been wrong

those two state now maintain no fenc for the sale of game that ha

and set two exampl for forti other state to follow
the remedi for all thi miser gamest lawbreak busi
is simpl and easili obtain let each state of the unit state and
each provinc and canada enact a bayn law absolut prohibit the

of that will be realli effect it will not do at all to let state
law rest with mere forbid the sale of game protect by the
state for that law is full of loophol it doe much good servic
ye but what earthli object can there be in ani state to the
enact of a law that is sweepingli effect and which can not be
evad save through the crimin conniv of offic of the law

in 1910 70000 dozen egyptian quail were ship to europ from

it seem to be natur for the mind of men who live in america in the

here is a montana object lesson on the frame of mind of the resid
hunter copi from outdoor life magazin denver for februari 1912
it is from a letter to the editor written by cb davi
novemb 27 28 29 and 30 1911 will remain a red letter dai with
a half thousand men for year to come these half thousand men
gather along the border of the yellowston nation park near
gardin montana at a point known as buffalo flat to extermin
elk the snow had driven the elk down to the foothil and buffalo
flat is on the border of the park and outsid the park the elk
enter thi littl vallei for food like hungri wolv shooter
not hunter gather along the border wait to catch an elk off
the reserv and kill it
on novemb 27th about 1500 elk cross the line and the slaughter
began i have not the data of the number kill thi dai but it wa
hundr
on the 28th twentytwo step over and were promptli execut
like custer band not on escap on the even of the 28th 600
were sight just over the line and the armi of 125 brave men
entrench themselv for the battl which wa expect to open next
morn befor daylight of the 29th the battl began the elk were
over the line feed on buffalo flat on hundr and twentyf
men pour bullet into thi band of 600 elk till the ground wa red
with blood and strewn with carcass and in their mad thei shot
each other on man wa shot through the eara close call anoth
receiv a bullet through hi coat sleev and anoth wa shot
through the bowel and cant live
my inform told me he particip in the slaughter and while he
would not take fifti dollar for what he saw and the experi he
went through yet he would not go through it again for 1000 when
my inform got back to gardin that dai there were four sleigh
load of elk each load contain from twenti to thirtyf elk
besid thirtytwo mule and hors carri on to two each thi
wa onli a part of the slaughter hundr more were carri to
other point and thi wa onli on dai work
hundr of wound elk wander back into the park to die and
other di outsid the park the station at livingston montana
for a week look like a pack hous carcass were pile up on
the truck and depot platform the baggag car were load with elk
go to point east and west of livingston
mayb thi is all right mayb the govern cant stop the elk
from cross the line mayb the elk were help over but it
strike me there is someth wrong somewher

but the slaughter of the million of north american fox wolv
weasel skunk and mink ha so overwhelmingli reduc the fourfoot
enemi of the bird that the balanc of wild natur ha been preserv
as a rule the few predatori wild anim that remain ar not
slaughter the bird to a seriou extent and for thi we mai well be
thank
the domest catin such thickli settl commun as our northern
state from the atlant coast to the sandhil of kansa and nebraska
the domest cat is probabl the greatest fourfoot scourg of bird
life thousand of person who never have seen a hunt cat in action
will doubt thi statement but the proof of it truth is onli too
painfulli abund
unhappili it is the wai of the hunt cat to stalk unseen and to kill
the veri bird that ar most friendli with man and most help to him
in hi farm and fruitgrow busi the quail is about the onli
game bird that the cat affect serious and to it the cat is veri
destruct it is the robin catbird thrush bluebird dove

garden and orchard that afford good hunt for sly and savag old
thoma
when i wa a boi in my teen i had a last seri of object lesson
on the cat as a predatori anim our betti wa the most ambiti and
success domesticcat hunter of wild mammal of which i ever have
heard to her rat and mice were mere childsplai and after a time
their pursuit offer such tame sport that she sought fresh field for
her prowess then she brought in young rabbit chipmunk and
thirteenlin spermophil and onc she came in quit exhaust half
drag and half carri a big fat pocket gopher with her it seem
to be a point of honor that she should bring in her game and displai it
littl did we realiz then that in cours of time the wild bird would
becom so scarc that their slaughter by hous cat would demand
legisl action in the state
in consid the hunt cat let us call in a credibl wit of the
effect of domest cat on the bob white the follow is an
eyewit report by ernest b beardslei in outdoor life for april
1912 the local wa wellington sumner counti kansa
in the meantim old queen wa have a high old time up ahead some
hundr feet by then run up the bank and back down in the draw
we had hardli caught up when up goe mr savag gun and he give
both barrel i had seen noth up to date but i didnt have long
to wait for by the time i got up to him and the dog thei were both
in the high grass and had a great big common grai maltes
housecat and queen had a halfeaten quail that mr cat wa busi
with when disturb
well we follow the draw across the field and got nine of a covei
of sixteen that had been ahead of mr cat and about four oclock
that even we kill anoth whiteandgrai cat while drive
home that night mr savag told me that he had kill fifti or more
in three or four year thei will get in a draw full of
tumblegrass on a cold dai when quail dont like to fly and stai
right with them and even after feed on two or three thei will
lie and watch and when the covei move thei move when eat time
come around thei ar at it again and to a covei of young bird
thei ar sure death to the whole covei
well will told me never to overlook a housecat that i found as far
as a quarter of a mile from a farm or ranch for if thei have not
alreadi turn wild thei ar learn how easi it is to hunt and
live on game and ar almost as bad we found mr blackandwhit
hunter had eaten two quail just befor we kill him that even i
would rather not write what mr savag said when we found the
remain of a partlyeaten bird
my advic is dont let tame cat get awai when found out hunt
for the chanc ar thei have not seen a home in month and mayb
yearsand sai but thei do get big and bad when you meet on
give it to him good and dont let your dog run up to him until he
is out for keep i learn afterward that wa how will knew it wa
a cat queen had learn to back off and call for help on cat some
year befor
in the new york zoolog park we have had troubl of our own with
maraud cat thei establish themselv in a dai and quickli learn
where to seek easi game and good cover in the daytim thei lie close in
the thick brush exactli as tiger do in india but if not molest for
a period of dai thei becom bold and attack game in open view on
birdkil cat wa so shy of man that it wa onli after two week of
hard hunt morn and even that it wa kill
we have seen cat catch and kill grai squirrel chipmunk robin and
thrush and have found the feather of slaughter quail onc we had
grai rabbit breed in the park and their number reach between
eighti and nineti for a time thei fearlessli hop about in sight from
our window and thei were of great interest to visitor and to all of
us then the cat began upon them and in on year there wa not a
rabbit to be seen save at rare interv at the same time the
chipmunk of the park were almost extermin
that wa the last straw and we began a vigor war upon those wild and
predatori cat the cat came off second best we kill everi cat that
wa found hunt in the park and we certainli got some that were big
and bad we elimin that pest and we ar keep it elimin and
with what result
in 1911 a covei of eleven quail came and settl in our ground and
have remain there twenti time at least dure the past eight month
winter and spring i have seen the flock on the granit ledg not more
than forti feet from the rear window of my offic last spring when i
left the administr build at six oclock after the visitor had
gone i found two halfgrown rabbit calmli roost on the doormat
the rabbit ar slowli come back and the chipmunk ar visibl
increas in number the grai squirrel now chase over the walk
without fear of ani live thing and our duckl and young guinea
and peacock ar safe onc more
that cat destroi annual in the unit state sever million of
veri valuabl bird seem fairli beyond question i believ that in
settl region thei ar wors than weasel fox skunk and mink
combin becaus there ar about on hundr time as mani of them
and those that hunt ar not afraid to hunt in the daytim of cours i
am not sai that all cat hunt wild game but in the countri i
believ that fulli onehalf of them do
i am person acquaint with a cat in indiana on the farm of
rel which is notori for it hunt propens and it
remark abil in captur game even the ladi who is joint owner
of the cat feel veri badli about it destruct and ha said
over and over again that it ought to be kill but the cat is such a
famili pet that no on in the famili ha the heart to destroi it and as
yet no stranger ha come forward to plai the part of execution the
ladi in question assur me that to her certain knowledg that
particular cat would watch a nest of young robin week after week
until thei had grown up to such a size that thei were almost readi to
fly then he would kill them and devour them old tommi wa too wise
to kill the robin when thei were unduli small
in a great book entitl us bird and their protect by eh
forbush state ornithologist of massachusett and publish by the
massachusett state board of agricultur in 1905 there appear on page
362 mani interest fact on thi subject for exampl
mr william brewster tell of an acquaint in main who said
that hi cat kill about fifti bird a year mr ac dike wrote
to mr forbush of a cat own by a famili and well care for
thei watch it through on season and found that it kill
fiftyeight bird includ the young in five nest
nearli a hundr correspond scatter through all the counti
of the state report the cat as on of the greatest enemi of
bird the report that have come in of the tortur and kill of
bird by cat ar absolut sicken the number of bird kill
by them in thi state is appal
some cat lover believ that each cat kill on the averag not more
than ten bird a year but i have learn of two instanc where
more than that number were kill in a singl dai and anoth where
seven were kill if we assum howev that the averag cat on
the farm kill but ten bird per year and that there is on cat to
each farm in massachusett we have in round number seventi
thousand cat kill seven hundr thousand bird annual
illustr a hunt cat and it victim
thi cat had fed so bountifulli on the rabbit and squirrel of the
zoolog park that it at onli the brain of thi grai rabbit
in mr forbush book there is an illustr of the cat which kill
fiftyeight bird in on year and the anim wa photograph with a
dead robin in it mouth the portrait is reproduc in thi chapter
last year a strong effort wa made in massachusett to enact a law
requir cat to be licens on account of the amount of work
necessari in pass the nosaleofgam bill that measur wa not

of all men the farmer cannot afford the luxuri of their exist it

dog as destroy of birdsi have receiv mani letter from
protector of wild life inform me that the destruct of
groundnest bird and especi of upland game bird by roam
dog ha in some local becom a great curs to bird life
complaint of thi kind have come from new york massachusett
connecticut pennsylvania and elsewher usual the culprit ar
hunt dogssett pointer and hound
now sure it is not necessari to set forth here ani argument on thi
subject it is not open to argument or academ treatment of ani kind
the cold fact is
in the breed season of bird and while the young bird ar incap
of quick and strong flight all dog of everi descript should be
restrain from free hunt and all dog found hunt in the wood
dure the season refer to should be arrest and their owner
should be fine twenti dollar for each offens incident onehalf
the fine should go to the citizen who arrest the dog the method of
restrain hunt dog should devolv upon dog owner and the law
need onli prohibit or punish the act
beyond a doubt in state that still possess quail and ruf grous
free hunt by hunt dog lead to great destruct of nest and

the destruct of wild life by diseas
everi caus that ha the effect of reduc the total of wildlif
popul is now a matter of import to mankind the violent and
univers disturb of the balanc of natur that alreadi ha taken
place throughout the temper and frigid zone offer not onli food for
thought but it call for vigor action
there ar vast section in the popul centr of western civil
where the destruct of speci even to the point of extermin is
fairli inevit it is the wai of christian man to destroi all wild
life that come within the sphere of influenc of hi iron heel with
the except of the big game thi destruct is larg a
temperament result peculiar to the highest civil in india
where the same field have been plow for wheat and dahl and raggi for
at least 2000 year the indian antelop or black buck the sara
crane and the adjut stalk through the crop and the nilgai and
gazel inhabit the erod ravin in an agricultur land that averag
1200 peopl to the squar mile
we have seen that even in farm countri where mud villag ar as
thick as farm hous in nebraska wild anim and even hoof game can
live and hold their own through hundr of year of close associ
with man the explan is that the hindu regard wild anim as
creatur entitl to life liberti and the pursuit of happi and
thei ar not anxiou to shoot everi wild anim that show it head in
the unit state nearli everi gameinhabit commun is anim by
a feel that everi wild anim must necessarili be kill as soon as
seen and thi sentiment often lead to disgrac thing for
instanc in some part of new england a deer strai into a town is at
onc beset by the hue and cry and it is chase and assault until it
is dead by violent and disgrac mean new york state howev
seem to have outgrown that spirit dure the past ten year at least
a dozen deer in distress have been rescu from the hudson river or in
inland town or in barnyard in the suburb of yonker and new york
and carefulli care for until the zoo peopl could be commun
with last winter about 13 exhaust grebe and on loon were pick up
care for and final ship with tender care to the zoolog park
on distress doveki wa pick up but fail to surviv
the sentiment for the conserv of wild life ha chang the mental
attitud of veri mani peopl the old chinesemalai spirit which cri
kill kill and at onc run amuck among suddenli discov wild
anim is slowli be replac by a more human and intellig
sentiment thi is on of the hope and encourag sign of the
time
the destruct of wild anim by natur caus is an interest
subject even though pain we need to know how much destruct is
wrought by influenc wholli beyond the control of man and a few case
must be cite
rinderpest in africaprob the greatest slaughter ever wrought upon
wild anim by diseas dure histor time wa by rinderpest a
cattl plagu which afflict africa in the last decad of the previou
centuri origin the diseas reach africa by wai of egypt and
came as an import from europ from egypt it steadili travel
southward reach somaliland in 1889 in 1896 it reach the zambesi
river and enter rhodesia from thenc it went on southward almost to
the cape not onli did it sweep awai nineti percent of the nativ cattl
but it also destroi more than seventyf per cent of the buffalo
antelop and other hoof game of rhodesia it wa fear that mani
speci would be complet extermin but happili that fear wa not
realiz the buffalo and antelop herd were fifteen year in breed
up again to a reason number but thank to the respit from hunter
which thei enjoi for sever year final thei did recov
throughout british east africa the suppli of big game in 1905 wa veri
great but sinc that time it ha been veri greatli diminish by
shoot
carib diseasefrom time to time report have come from the provinc
of quebec and i think from main and new brunswick also of mani
carib have di of diseas the natur of that diseas ha remain
a mysteri becaus it seem that no pathologist ever ha had an
opportun to investig it fortun howev the alleg diseas
never ha been suffici widespread or continu to make
appreci inroad on the total number of carib and appar the
troubl ha been local
scab in mountain sheepscab is a contagi and persist skin
diseas that affect sheep and is destruct when not control
fifteen year ago it prevail in some portion of the west in colorado
it ha sever time been report that mani bighorn mountain sheep were
kill by scab which wa contract on wild mountain pastur that
had been gone over by domest sheep carri that diseas from the
report current at that time we infer that about 200 mountain sheep
had been affect it wa fear that the diseas would spread through
the wild flock and becom gener but thi did not occur it seem
that the remnant flock had becom so isol from on anoth that the
isol of the affect flock save the other
lumpyjaw in antelop and sheepit is a lament fact that some at
least of the unit state herd of pronghorn antelop ar afflict
with a veri deadli chronic infect diseas known as actinomycosi or
lumpyjaw it ha been brought into the zoolog park five time by
specimen ship from colorado texa wyom and montana i think our
first case came to us in 1902
in it earli stage thi diseas is so subtl and slow that it is month
in develop and thi featur render it all the more deadli through
the spread of infect long befor the ailment can be discov
on of our antelop arriv appar in perfect health when
receiv wa on gener principl kept isol in rigid quarantin
for two month at the expir of that period no diseas of ani kind
have becom manifest the anim wa place on exhibit with two
other that had been in the park for more than a year in perfect
health
in on more week the late arriv develop a swell on it jaw
drool at the corner of the mouth and becam feverishsur symptom
of the dread diseas at onc it wa remov and isol but in about
10 dai it di the other two antelop were promptli attack and
eventu di
the cours of the diseas is veri intens and thu far it ha proven
incur in our wild anim we have lost about 10 antelop from it
and on deer usual in each case within ten dai or two week from
the discoveri of the first outward signth well known swell on the
jaw on case that wa detect immedi upon arriv wa veri
persist treat by dr blair and the anim actual surviv for
four month but final it succumb from first to last not a singl
case wa cure
in 1912 the futur of the pronghorn antelop in real captiv seem
hopeless we have decid not to bring ani more specimen to our
institut partli becaus all avail candid seem reason
certain to be affect with lumpyjaw and partli becaus we ar
unwil to run further risk of have other hoof anim inocul
by them todai we ar anxious wonder whether the jaw diseas of the
pronghorn is destin to extermin the speci such a catastroph is
much to be fear thi is probabl on of the reason why the antelop
is steadili disappear despit protect
in 1906 we discov the exist of actinomycosi among the black
mountain sheep of northern british columbia two specimen out of six
were badli affect the bone of the jaw be greatli enlarg and
perfor by deep pit the black sheep of the stickin and iskoot
region ar so seldom seen by white men save when a sportsman kill hi
allot of three specimen we realli do not know anyth about the
extent to which actinomycosi prevail in those herd or how deadli ar
it effect on thing seem quit certain from the appear of the
diseas skull found by the writer in the taxiderm laboratori of
frederick sauter in new york the enorm swell of the diseas jaw
bone clearli indic a diseas that in some case affect it victim
throughout mani month such a condit as we found in those sheep
could not have been reach in a few dai after the diseas becam
appar now in our antelop the collaps and death of the victim
usual occur in about 10 dai from the time that the first swell
wa observ which mean a veri virul diseas and rapid progress at
the climax the jaw of on of our antelop which wa figur in dr
blair paper in the eleventh annual report of the new york zoolog
societi 1906 show onli a veri slight lesion in comparison with those
of the mountain sheep
the conclus is that among the sheep thi diseas doe not carri off
it victim in ani short period like 10 dai the anim must surviv
for some month after it becom appar at least two parti of
american sportsmen have shot ram afflict with thi diseas but i
have no report of ani sheep have been found dead from thi caus
thi diseas is well known among domest cattl but so far as we ar
awar it never befor ha been found among wild anim the black sheep
herd wherein it wa found in british columbia ar absolut isol
from domest cattl and all their influenc and therefor it seem
quit certain that the diseas develop among the sheep
spontaneouslya remark episod to sai the least whether it will
extermin the black mountain sheep speci and in time spread to the
white sheep of the northwest is of cours a matter of conjectur but
there is noth in the world to prevent a calam of that kind the
white sheep of yukon territori rang southward until in the sheslai
mountain thei touch the sphere of influenc of the black sheep where
the diseas could easili be transmit it would be a good thing if
there exist between the two speci a sheepless zone about 200 mile
wide
i greatli fear that actinomycosi is destin to plai an import part
in the final extinct that seem to be the impend fate of the
beauti and valuabl pronghorn antelop in view of our hard
experi extend through ten year 19021912 i think thi fear
is justifi all person who live in countri still inhabit by
antelop ar urg to watch for thi diseas if ani antelop ar found
dead see if the lower jaw is badli swollen and discharg pu if it
is buri the bodi quickli burn the ground over and advis the writer
regard the case
the rabbit plagueon of the strangest freak of natur of which we
know as effect the wholesal destruct of wild anim by diseas
is the rabbit plagu in the northern wilder and particularli
central canada where rabbit exist in great number and suppli the
want of a larg carnivor popul thi plagu is well known and
among trapper and woodsmen is a common topic of convers the best
treatment of the subject is to be found in ernest t seton life
histori of northern anim vol i p 640 et seq from thi i
quot
invari the year of greatest number of rabbit is follow by a
year of plagu which sweep them awai leav few or no rabbit in the
land the denser the rabbit popul the more drastic is it
ravag by the plagu thei ar wipe out in a singl spring by
epidem diseas usual character by swell of the throat
sore under the armpit and groin and by diarrhea
the year 1885 wa for the countri around carberri a rabbit year the
greatest ever known in that countri the number of rabbit wa
incred wr hine kill 75 in two hour and estim that he
could have kill 500 in a dai the farmer were stricken with fear that
the rabbit pest of australia wa to be repeat in manitoba but the
year 18867 chang all that the rabbit di until their bodi
dot the countri in thousand the plagu seem to kill all the
member of the vast host of 1885
the strangest item of mr seton stori is yet to be told in 1890 mr
seton stock hi park at co cob conn with hare and rabbit from
sever wide separ local in 1903 the plagu came and swept
them all awai mr seton sent specimen to the zoolog park for
examin by the park veterinari surgeon dr w reid blair thei were
found to be infest by great number of a danger bloodsuck
parasit known as strongylu strigosu which produc death by anemia
and emaci there were hundr of those parasit in each anim i
assist in the examin and wa shown by dr blair under the
microscop that strongylu put forth egg liter by hundr of
thousand
the life histori of that parasit is not well known but it mai easili
develop that the cycl of it maximum destruct is seven year
and therefor it mai be account for the sevenyear plagu among the
hare and rabbit of the northern unit state and canada
possibl strongylu strigosu is all that stand between canada and a
pest of rabbit like that of australia just why thi parasit is
inop in australia or why it ha not been introduc there to
lessen the rabbit evil we do not know mr seton declar that the
rabbit of hi park were subject to all the ill of the flesh except
possibl writer paralysi and housemaid knee
parasit infect of wild ducksth diseas of wild game
especi waterfowl grous and quail have caus heavi loss in
america as well as in european countri and scientist have been
carefulli investig the caus and the gener natur of the
maladi as well as probabl method of prevent and cure mr geo
atkinson a wellknown practic naturalist of portag la prairi
manitoba write as follow to a local paper on thi subject which i
find quot in the nation sportsman
the question which ha develop these import proport dure
the past year is that of the extent of the parasit infect of
our wild duck and other game and the possibl of the extend
transmiss of these parasit to domest stock or even human
by eat
the parasit in question ar contain in small ellipt case
found underli the surfac muscl of the breast and in advanc
case extend deeper into the flesh and the muscular tissu of
the leg and wing thei ar not notic in the ordinari process
of pluck the bird for the tabl and ar not found intern so
that the onli method of discov their presenc is by slit
the skin of the breast and pare it back a few inch when the
wormlik sac will be seen buri in the flesh
these parasit have come to my notic period dure the
process of skin bird for mount dure the past number of
year but it wa onli when thei appear in unusu number last
fall that i made inquiri of the biolog bureau of washington
and ottawa for inform of their life histori and the
possibl of their transmiss to other host
repli from these sourc surpris me with the inform that
veri littl wa known of the life histori of ani of the
sarcosporidia of which group thi wa a speci noth wa known
of the method of infect or the transfer from host to host or
speci to speci and both depart ask for specimen for
examin
author ar a unit in opinion that the question is on of great
import to game conserv and although opinion of the
danger from eat differ somewhat a record is given of a hog fed
upon affect flesh develop parasit in the muscl in six
week time while a case of a man death from dropsi wa found to
be the result of develop of these parasit in the valv of the
heart
the abil of these low form of life to withstand extrem of heat
make it necessari for more than ordinari cook to be assur of
kill them and sinc their presenc is unnot in the ordinari
cours of dress the bird for the tabl there is littl doubt
that veri consider number of these parasit ar consum at
our tabl everi season with result at present unknown to us
the speci i have found most particularli infect have been
mallard shovel teal gadwal and pintail and the bird
outwardli in the best condit have frequent been found load
with sac of these parasit and onli the turn back of the breast
skin can disclos their presenc
the greatest slaughter of wild duck by diseas occur on great salt
lake utah until the duck diseas intestin coccidiosi broke out
there in the summer of 1910 the annual market slaughter of duck at
the mouth of bear river had been enorm when at salt lake citi in
1888 i made an effort to arous the sportsmen whom i met to the
necess of a reform but my exhort fell on deaf ear natur
the sweep awai of the remain duck by diseas would suggest a
heavens judgment upon the slaughter were it not for the fact that
the last state of the unfortun duck is if anyth wors than the
first
on oct 17 1911 the annual report of the chief of the biolog
survei contain the follow inform on thi subject
epidem among wild duck on great salt lakefollow a long
dry season which favor the rear of a larg number of wild
duck but materi reduc the area of the feed pond
result in great overcrowd a sever epidem broke out about
august 1 1910 among the wild duck about great salt lake utah
dead duck could be count by thousand along the shore and the
diseas rage unab until late fall shoot club found it
necessari to declar a close season some of the dead duck were
forward to the biolog survei and were turn over for
examin to the bureau of anim industri by the expert of
which the diseas wa diagnos as intestin coccidiosi
variou plan of reliev the situat were tri the irrig
ditch were close thu provid the slough and pond with fresh
water and lime wa sprinkl on the mud flat and duck trail
great improv follow thi treatment and experi prove
that duck provid with abund fresh water and clean food began
to recov immedi these method promis success but later it
wa propos that the marsh be drain and expos to the sun
raysa cours which cannot be recommend that coccidia ar not
alwai kill by exposur to the sun is shown by their surviv on
the site of old chicken yard an ad disadvantag of the plan is
that drain and dry the marsh would have a bad effect on the
natur duck food and upon the bird themselv

destruct of wild life by the element
it is a fix condit of natur that whenev and wherev a wild
speci exist in a state of natur free from the trammel and
limit that contact with man alwai impos the speci is fit
to surviv all ordinari climat influenc freedom of action and the
exercis of sever option in the line of individu mainten under
stress is essenti to the welfar of everi wild speci
a pronghorn antelop herd that is free can drift befor a blizzard
can keep from freez by the exercis and eventu come to shelter
let that same herd drift against a barbedwir fenc five mile long
and it whole scheme of selfpreserv is upset the herd perish
then and there
cut out the undergrowth of a given section drain the swamp and mow
down all the weed and tall grass and the next particularli hard winter
starv and freez the quail
natur the cut of forest clear of brush and drainag of
marsh is more or less calamit to all the speci of bird that
inhabit such place and find there winter food and shelter redwing
blackbird and real estat boom can not inhabit the same swamp
contemporan befor the relentless march of civil the wild
indian the bison and mani of the wild bird must inevit disappear
we cannot chang condit that ar as inexor as death itself the
wild life must either adjust itself to the condit that civil man
impos upon it or perish i sai civil man for the reason that
the primit race of man ar not deadli extermin of speci as
we ar i know of not on speci of wild life that ha been
extermin by savag man without the aid of hi civil peer
as civil march ever onward over the prairi into the bad
land and the forest over the mountain and even into the farthest
corner of death vallei the desert of desert the struggl of the wild
bird mammal and fish is daili and hourli intensifi man must help
them to maintain themselv or accept a lifeless contin the best
help consist in let the wild creatur throughli alon so that
thei can help themselv but quail often need to be fed in critic
period the best food is wheat screen place under littl tent of
straw bring food and shelter togeth
in the well settl portion of the unit state such speci as
quail ruf grous wild turkei pinnat grous and sage grous hang
to life by slender thread a winter of exception deep snow much
sleet and a late spring alwai caus grave anxieti among the state
game warden in pennsylvania a veri earnest movement is in progress to
educ and persuad farmer to feed the quail in winter and much good
is be done in that direct
mr erasmu wilson of the pittsburgh gazettetim is the apostl of
that movement
quail should be fed everi winter in everi northern state the method
to be pursu will be mention elsewher
by wai of illustr here is a sampl game report from la anima
colorado feb 22 1912
after the most sever winter weather experienc for twenti year we
ar abl to comput approxim our loss of feather life it is
seventyf per cent of the quail throughout the irrig district
and about twenti per cent of meadowlark in the rough cedarcov
section south of the arkansa river the loss among the quail wa much
lighter the ground sparrow suffer sever while the english
sparrow seem to have come through in good shape mani cottontail
rabbit starv to death while the deep light snow of januari made
them easi prei for hawk and coyot ft webber
it would be possibl to record mani instanc similar to the abov but
why multipli them and now behold the cruel corollari
at least twentyf time dure the past two year i have heard and
read argument by sportsmen against my propos for a 5year close
season for quail take the ground that the sportsmen ar not wholli
to blame for the scarciti of quail it is the cold winter that kill
them off
so then becaus the fierc winter murder the bob white wholesal
thei should not have a chanc to recov themselv could human be
possibl assum a more absurd attitud
ye it is coldli and incontest true that even after such winter
slaughter as mr webber ha report abov the veri next season will
find the quail hunter joyous take the field hi face beam with
health and good live to hunt down and shoot to death as mani as
possibl of the piti 25 per cent remnant that manag to surviv the
pitiless winter how mani quail hunter think you ever stai their
hand becaus of a hard winter on the quail i warrant not on out of
everi hundr how mani state in thi union ever put on a close season
becaus of a hard winter ill warrant that not on ever did and i
think there is onli on state whose game commission have the power to
act in that wai without recours to the legislatur thi situat is
intoler

i want all sensibl honest sportsmen to stop cite the kill of game
bird by sever winter as a reason why long close season ar not
necessari and why automat gun dont matter and i want sportsmen
to consid their duti and not go out hunt ani game speci that ha
been slaughter by a hard winter until it ha had at least five year
in which to recov ani other cours is cruel selfish and
shortsight and a word to the human should be suffici
the worst exhibit ever made of the wolfish instinct to slai that
spring etern in some human breast ar those brought about
through the distress or error of wild anim by wai of illustr
consid the slaughter of halfstarv elk that took place in the edg
of idaho in the winter of 1909 and 1910 when about seven hundr elk
that were driven out of the yellowston park at it northwestern corner
by the deep snow fled into idaho in the hope of find food the
inhabit met the starv herd with repeat rifl and as the
unfortun anim struggl westward through the snow and storm thei
were slaughter without merci bull and cow old and young all of
the seven hundr went down and stonei indian could not have act
ani wors than did those settler
on anoth occas it is record that the pronghorn antelop herd
of the mammoth hot spring wander across the line into gardin and
quickli met a savag attack of gunner with rifl a number of those
rare and valuabl anim were kill and other fled back into the
park with broken leg dangl in the air
in the interest of public decenc and for the protect of the
reput of american citizenship on of two thing should be done
the northern boundari of the park should be extend northward beyond
gardin or els the deathtrap should be move elsewher the case of
the town of gardin is refer to the legislatur of montana for
treatment
beyond question the highest sentiment of human ar those that ar
stir by the misfortun of killabl game dure the past thirti
year i have notic some interest manifest of the increas
sympathi for wild creatur that steadili is grow in a larg section
of the public mind thirti year ago the appear of a deer or moos
in the street of ani eastern villag nearli alwai wa in itself a
signal for a grand chase of the unfortun creatur and it speedi
slaughter todai in the eastern state the gener feel is quit
differ the appear of a deer in the hudson river itself or a
moos in a main villag is a signal not for a wild chase and cruel
slaughter but for a gener effort to save the anim from be hurt
or kill i know thi through ocular proof at least half a dozen lost
and bewild deer have been carefulli driven into yard or barn
and human kept and care for until thei could be ship to us
sever have been caught while swim in the hudson bewild and
panicstricken the latest captur occur in new york citi itself
a puma that escap about 1902 from the zoolog park instead of
be shot wa captur by sensibl peopl in the hamlet of bronxdal
aliv and unhurt and safe return to us
in some portion of the east though not all the dai of the hue and cry
over a wild anim in town seem to be about over on long island some
human person found an injur turkei vultur and took it in and care
for itonli to be persecut by illadvis game warden becaus thei
had a forbidden wild bird in their possess there ar time when it
is the highest moral duti of a game warden to follow the advic of
privat mulvanei to the orfic boi and shut yer oy to the
rigul sorr
such occurr as these ar becom more and more common the desir
of the great silent major is to save the wild creatur and it
is in respons to that sentiment that thousand of peopl ar todai in
the field against the armi of destruct
it is the duti of everi sportsman to assist in promot the passag of
a law like our new york law which empow the state game commiss to
throw extra protect around ani speci that ha been slaughter too
much by snow or by firearm by close the open season as long as mai
be necessari can there be in all america even on think reason
be who can not see the justic and also the imper necess of
thi measur it seem imposs
give the game the benefit of everi doubt if it becom too thick your
gun can quickli thin it out but if it is onc extermin it will be

that kill songbird for food continu dr bishop is not
confin to the poor italian i learn on octob 27 when on of the
most promin and wealthi italian ornithologistsa delight
mantold me he had shot 180 skylark and pipit the dai befor and
that hi famili like them far better than other game our prejudic
against sell game doe not exist in europ and thi same
ornithologist told me he often shot 200 duck in a dai at hi

widgeon and teal
an ornithologist inde a sportsman also is he not he belong
with hi brother ornithologist of the roccolo who net their game
with the aid of blind bird brave men gallant sportsmen ar these
men of italyand western franc also if the tale is true
if the peopl of europ can stand the wholesal systemat slaughter of
their song and insectivor bird we can if thei ar too
meanspirit to rise up make a row about it and stop it then let
them pai the price but by the etern antonio shall not come to thi
countri with the songbird tast of the roccolo and indulg them here
the abov fact have been cite not at all for the benefit of europ
but for our own good the american peopl ar now confront by the
italian and austrian and hungarian labor and saloonkeep and
mechan and all american should have an exact measur of the
sentiment of southern europ toward our wild life gener especi
the bird that we do not shoot at all and therefor ar easi to kill
when a warden or a citizen arrest an alien for kill ani of our
nongam bird show the judg these record of how thei do thing in
itali and ask for the extrem penalti
i have taken pain to publish the abov fact from eyewit in
order that everi game commission game warden and state legisl who
read these page mai know exactli what he is up against in the alien
popul of our countri from southern europ for unnumb
gener the peopl of itali have been taught to believ that it is
perfectli right to shoot and devour everi songbird that fli the
venetian is no respect of speci and when an italian ornithologist
can go out and murder 180 linnet and pipit in on dai for the pot
it is time for american to think hard
we sincer hope that it will not requir blow and kick and fine to
remov from antonio head the idea that america is not itali and that
the slaughter of song bird dont go in thi countri i strongli
recommend to everi state the enact of a law that will do these
thing
1prohibit the own carri or us of firearm by alien and
2prohibit the us of firearm in hunt by ani natur alien
from southern europ until after a 10year resid in america
from report that have come to me at first hand regard italian in
the east hungarian in pennsylvania and austrian in minnesota it
seem absolut certain that all member of the lower class of
southern europ ar a danger menac to our wild life
on account of the nowaccurs landofliberti idea everi foreign
who sail past the statu on bedlo island and land on our
libertyridden shore is firmli convinc that now at last he can do
as he pleas and as on of hi first wai in which to show hi
newlyacquir person liberti and independ in the land of easi
mark he bui a gun and goe out to shoot free game
if we as a peopl ar so indol and so somnol that antonio get
awai with all our wild bird then do we deserv to be rob
italian ar pour into america in a steadi stream thei ar strong
prolif persist and of tireless energi new york citi now contain
340000 of them thei work while the nativ american sleep wherev
thei settl their tendenc is to root out the nativ american and take
hi place and hi incom toward wild life the italian labor is a
human mongoos give him power to act and he will quickli extermin
everi wild thing that wear feather or hair to our songbird he is
liter a pestil that walketh at noondai
as we have shown the italian is a born pothunt and he ha grown up
in the fix belief that kill songbird for food is right to him
all is game that goe into the bag the moment he set foot in the open
he provid himself with a shotgun and he look about for thing to
kill it is a free countri therefor he mai kill anyth he can
find cook it and eat it if anybodi attempt to check himsapristi

when the new york zoolog societi began work on it park in 1899 the
northern half of the borough of the bronx wa a regular daili
huntingground for the slaughter of songbird and all other bird that
could be found everi sundai it wa bangetti bang from pelham bai

been given with cheer alacr in the fall of 1912 an appeal to the
polic commission result in a gener order to stop all hunt and
shoot in the borough of the bronx and a reform is now on
the war on the birdkil in new york citi began in 1900 it seem
that if the zoolog societi did not take up the matter the slaughter
would continu indefinit the white man burden wa taken up and
the stori of the war is rather illumin mr go shield

that those three men could not be stop by threat and that thei

possibl
the largest haul of dead bird wa 43 robin oriol thrush and
woodpeck captur along with the five italian who commit the
indiscret of sit down in the wood to divid their dead bird we
save all the bird in alcohol and show them in court the judg

pennsylvania ha had the worst experi of alien slaughter of ani

to a certain extent a matter of tast but there is at least on club
of sportsmen into which no dovekil can enter provid hi standard
of ethic is known in advanc

the case is quit differ no white man call himself a sportsman
ever indulg in such low pastim as the kill of such bird for
food that burden of disgrac rest upon the negro and poor white of

in the north the econom valu of our song bird and other destroy
of insect and weed seed is understood by a major of the peopl and
as far as possibl those bird ar protect from all human enemi but
in the south a new divis of the armi of destruct ha risen into
deadli promin
in recreat magazin for mai 1909 mr charl askin publish a
most startl and illumin articl entitl the south problem
in game protect it brought togeth in concret form and with
eyewit reliabl the impress that for month previou had
been gain ground in the north in order to give the testimoni of a
man who ha seen what he describ i shall now give numer quotat
from mr askin articl which certainli bear the stamp of
truth without ani race prejudic whatev it is a calm
judici unemot analysi of a veri bad situat and i
particularli commend it alik to the farmer of the north and all the
true sportsmen of the south
in hi open paragraph mr askin describ game and hunt
condit in the south as thei were down to twenti year ago when the
negro were too poor to own gun and shoot wa not for them
special work of the southern negro
it is all differ now sai mr askin and the old dai will onli
come back with the water that ha gone down the stream the master
is with hi father or he is while awai hi last dai on the
courthous step of the town perhap a chimnei or two remain of
what wa onc the big hous on the hill possibl it is still
stand but as forlorn and lifeless as a dead tree the muscadin
grape still grow in the swale and the persimmon in the pastur
field but neither possum nor coon is left to eat them the last
deer vanish year ago the rabbit di in their babi coat and
the quail were kill in june old uncl ik ha gone across the
great river with hi master and hi grandson glanc at you
askanc nod sullenli whistl to hi half breed bird dog
shoulder hi three dollar gun and leav you he is typic of the
chang and ha caus it thi grandson of dear old uncl ik
in the same wai the white man is tell the black to abid upon the
plantat rais cotton and corn and further than thi noth
will be requir of him he can cheat a white man or a black steal
in a petti wai anyth that come handi live in marriag or out of
it to pleas himself kill anoth negro if he like and lastli
shoot everi wild thing that can be eaten if onli he rais the
cotton and the corn but the white sportsmen of the south have never
willingli grant the shoot privileg in it entireti and henc
thi stori thei have told him to trap the rabbit pot the robin
slaughter the dove kill the song bird but to spare the white
sportsman game the aristocrat littl bobwhit quail
in the begin not so much damag to southern game interest could
be accomplish by our color man and brother howev decid hi
inclin he had no monei no ammunit and no gun hi weapon
were an ax a club a trap and a hound dog possibl he might own
an old war musket bore out for shot such an outfit wa not adapt
to quail shoot and especi to wing shoot with which
knowledg dixi sportsmen were content let the negro rambl about
with hi hound dog and hi war musket he couldnt possibl kill the
quail and so uncl ik grandson loaf and potter about in the
field with hi ax and hi hound dog not do so much harm to the
quail but acquir knowledg of the habit of the bird and skill
as a stillhunt pothunt that would serv him well later on
the negro belong to a primit race of peopl and all such race
have keener ey than white men whose father have pore over line
of black and white he learn to see the rabbit in it form the
squirrel in the leafi tree and the quail huddl in the grass
the least shade of grai in the shadow of the creek bank he
distinguish at onc as a rabbit a glint flash from a tree top
he knew instantli as be caus by the slight movement of a hidden
squirrel and the quiver of a singl stem of sedg grass told him of
a bevi of bird hide in the depth the pothunt negro ha all
the skill of the indian ha more industri in hi loaf and kill
without piti and without restraint thi grandson of uncl ik wa
grow sulki too with the knowledg that the white man wa
bribe him with half a loaf to rais cotton and corn when he might
as well exact it all and thi he shortli did as we shall see
the time came when cotton went up to sixteen cent a pound and
singl breechload gun went down to five dollar apiec the
negro had monei now and the merchantsthes men who had said let
the nigger alon so long as he rais cotton and cornsold him the
gun a gun for everi black idler man and boi in all the south
then shortli a wail went up from the sportsmen the nigger ar
kill our quail thei not onli were kill them but most of the
bird were alreadi dead on the ground of the southern field club
where sixti bevi were rais by the dog in on dai within two
year but three bevi could be found in a dai by the hardest kind
of hunt and thi stori wa repeat all over the south now the
negro began to rais bird dog in place of hound and he carri
hi new gun to church if servic happen to be held on a week dai
final the negro had grown up and had compass hi ambit he
could shoot partridg fly just the same as a white man wa a
white man except for a trifl differ in color and he could
kill more bird too three time as mani it wa mere a chang
from the old order to the new in which a darkskin sportsman
had taken the place in plantat life of the dear old colonel of
love memori the negro had exact hi price for rais cotton and
corn

when he ha a sale for the bird but when it come to shoot for
fun he want to be with the gang i have seen the darki at
christma time collect fifti in a drove with everi man hi dog and
spread out over the field such a gloriou time as he ha then a

cross field after field comb the countri with fine teeth that
leav neither wild anim nor bird life behind
there come a time toward the spring of the year after the quail
season is over when the averag rural darki is between hai and
grass the merchant on whom he ha depend for suppli make it a

of the piccaninni who with glow ey would declar them
mo as good as chicken what happen to the robin dove lark
red bird mock bird and all songster in thi hungri season
need hardli to be state
it is also a time between hai and grass for the rabbit and the
quail the corn field ar bare and the weed seed ar exhaust a
spring cold spell pinch thei lose their vital becom thin and
quit lack their ordinari wari then the figurefour trap
spring up in the hedgerow and the sedg while the work of
decim goe more rapidli along the rabbit can no longer escap
the halfstarv dog the thin cover fail to hide the quail
and the song bird betrai themselv by sing of the come
spring
with the grow scarciti of the game now come the season of sedg
and field burn thi is done ostens to prepar the land for
spring plow but realli to destroi the last refug of the quail
and rabbit so that thei can be bag with certainti all the
negro of a neighborhood collect for on of these burn all
their dog and of cours all the boi from six year old up thei
surround the field and set it on fire in mani place leav small
open for the game to dash out among the motlei assembl i have
seen quail fly out of the burn grass with flame particl still
attach to them thei alight on the burnt ground too bewild to
fly again and the boi and dog pick them up craze rabbit try the
gauntlet amidst the bark cur shout negro and pop gun
but death is sure and quick the few quail that mai escap have no
refug from the hawk and noth to eat so everi battu of thi
kind mark the absolut end of the bird in on vicin and the
next dai the darki repeat the perform elsewher
at thi season of the year the first of mai the black ar put
in some of their on hundr work dai while the singl
breechload rust in the chimnei corner sure the few bird that
have escap the forai of the gang live through the hungri dai
and surviv their burn home can now call bob white and mate in
peac but school is out and the summer sun is put new life into
the bare feet of the halfgrown boi and the halfbre bird dog
ar busier than thei were even in winter the young rabbit ar
kill befor thei get out of the nest and the quail egg must be
hidden rare well that escap both the ey of the boi and the
nose of the dog after all it is not surpris that but three
bevi remain of the sixti doubtless thei would not except that
natur is veri kind to her own in the sunni south
not everi white man in the south is a sportsman or even a shooter
mani ar pure busi men who have said let the nigger do as he
like so long as he rais cotton and bui our good but dixi ha
her full share of true men of the outofdoor and thei have sworn
in downright southern fashion that thi thing ha got to end
nevertheless their problem is deep and puzzl in alabama thei
made an effort and a begin thei ask for a law requir everi
man to obtain written permiss befor enter the land of
anoth to hunt and shoot thei ask for a resid licens law
tax everi gun not less than five dollar a year for a shorten
season a bag limit and a complet system of state warden
unfortun a lot of white farmer were in the same rang as the
black and be hit too thei rais a great outcri the result
wa that the alabama sportsmen got everyth thei ask for except
the foundat of the structur thei were try to build the high
resid licens or gun tax which alon could have shut out three
dollar gun and save the remnant of the game under the new law the
sale of game wa forbidden neither could it be ship out of the
state aliv or dead the ever popular nonresid licens wa
provid for the season wa shorten and the bag limit the
offic of state game warden wa creat with deputi to be paid
from fine hunt upon the land of anoth without written
permiss becam a misdemeanor and then the whole thing wa
nullifi by reduc the resid licens to noth where a man
shot upon hi own land on dollar in hi own counti and two
dollar outsid of it in it practic work the new law amount
to thi a few northern gunner have paid the nonresid licens
fee and enough resid licens have been taken out by the citi
sportsmen to make up the handsom salari of the state warden the
negro still hunt upon hi own land or upon the land of the man who
want corn and cotton rais with perfect indiffer to the
whole thing who wa to enforc the law against him not the on
disgust deputi with three big counti to patrol who depend for
hi salari upon the fine collect from the negro it would take
on man to everi three mile squar to protect the game in the
south
the on effect wai of deal with the situat in alabama wa
to have legisl three dollar gun out of exist with a five
dollar tax ad to thi nearli a like amount on dog hardli a
sportsman in the south will disagre with thi conclus but
sportsmen never had a major vote either in the south or in the
north and the south grave problem is yet unsolv
i do not favor depriv the black man of hi natur human right to
hunt and shoot if he is the owner of land or if he leas or rent
it or if he doe not he should have exactli the same privileg of
hunt that the white man ha that is not the question now
howev but how to restrict him to legal shoot to make him
amen to the law that govern the white man to depriv him of
the absolut licens he now enjoi to kill throughout the year
without merci without discrimin without restraint if onli
for selfish reason we of the north should reach to southern
sportsmen a help hand for by and by the last of our migratori
song bird will go down into dixi and never return
mr askin ha fairli state a profoundli disturb case the remedi
must contain at least three ingredi the sportsmen of the south must
stop the unjustifi slaughter of their nonmigratori game bird as a
matter of comiti between state the gentlemen of the south must pass
law to stop the kill of northern songbird and all cropprotect
bird for food final all men north and south east and west must
unit in the work that is necessari to secur the immedi enact by

mani thought ar suggest by these london list of bird slaughter and
loot
it will be notic that the breast of the grebe ha almost wholli
disappear from the feather market and from women hat the reason is
that there ar no longer enough bird of that group to hold a place in
the london market few inde ar the american who know that from 1900
to 1908 the lake region of southern oregon wa the scene of the
slaughter of uncount thousand of those bird which continu until
the grebe were almost extermin
when the wonder lyrebird of australia had been almost extermin
for it tail feather it open slaughter wa stop by law and a
heavi fine wa impos on export amount i have been told to

surreptiti export of 200 skin to the london feather market
in india the smuggl outward of the skin of protect bird is
constantli go on occasion an export is caught and fine but
that doe not stop the traffic
birdlov must now bid farewel forev to all the bird of paradis

now with these enorm price prevail is it ani wonder that the
egret and heron ar be relentlessli pursu to the uttermost end
of the earth i think that ani man who realli know the habit of egret
and heron and the total imposs of ani quantiti of their shed
feather be pick up in a market state must know in hi heart
that if the london and continent feather market keep open a few year
longer everi speci that furnish short select plume will be
utterli extermin from off the face of the earth
let the english peopl make no mistak about thi nor be fool by ani
fairi tale of the feather trade about venezuelan garcero and vast
quantiti of valuabl plume pick off the bush and out of the mud
those carefulli concoct egretfarm stori make love read but
the reader who examin the evid will soon decid the extent of
their truth i think that thei contain not even ten per cent of
truth and i shall not rest until the stori of leon laglaiz and
mayeul grisol have been put to the test in the region where thei
origin
a few plume mai be pick out of the jungl ye but as for ani
commerci quantiti it is at present beyond belief besid we have
direct eyewit testimoni to the contrari
it must not be infer that the friend of bird in england have been
idl or silent in the presenc of the london feather trade on the
contrari the royal societi for the protect of wild bird and mr
jame buckland have so strongli attack the feather industri that the
london chamber of commerc ha felt call upon to come to it rescu
mr buckland on hi own individu account ha done yeoman servic to
the caus and hi devot to the bird and hi tireless energi ar
both almost beyond the reach of prais in word at the last moment
befor go to press i learn that the birdsplumag bill ha achiev
the triumph of a first read in parliament which look as if
success is at last in sight the power pamphlet that he ha written
publish and circul at hi own expens entitl pro and con of
the plumag bill is a splendid effort what a piti it is that more
individu ar not similarli inspir to make independ effort in the
protect caus but strang to sai few inde ar the men who have
either the nerv or the abil to go it alon
on the introduct in parliament of the bill to save the bird from the
feather trade it wa oppos through the effort of the chamber of
commerc on the ground that if ani bill against the sale of plume
should pass and plume could not be sold the london busi in
wildbird skin and feather would immedi be transfer to the
contin
in the face of that devast and altogeth horribl prospect and
becaus the london feather dealer need the monei the bill wa at
first defeatedto the great joi of the chamber of commerc and mr
downham but the caus of bird will win in the end becaus it is
right
the feather dealer have been shrewdli activ in the defens of their
trade and the method thei have emploi for influenc public opinion
have quit outshon those put forth by their brethren in america i have
befor me a copi of a booklet bear the name of mr cf downham as
the author and the london chamber of commerc ha loan it good name
as publish altogeth it is a veri shrewd piec of work even though
it argument in justif of bird slaughter for the feather market
ar too absurd and weak for seriou consider
the chief burden of the defend of bird slaughter for millineri
purpos is on account of the destruct of egret and heron but
particularli the former to offset as far as possibl the absolut
true charg that egret bear their best plume in their breed season
when the helpless young ar in the nest and the parent bird must be
kill to obtain the plume the feather trade ha obtain from three
frenchmenleon laglaiz mayeul grisol and f geaya beauti and
plausibl stori to the effect that in venezuela the enorm output of
egret plume ha been obtain by pick up off the bush and out of
the water and mud the shed feather of those bird accord to the
stori venezuela is full of egret farm call garceroswher the
bird breed and moult under strict supervis and kindli drop their
feather in such place that it is possibl to find them and to pick
them up in a high state of preserv and we ar ask to believ
that it is these veri venezuelan pickedup feather that command in
london the high price of 44 per ounc

mr laglaiz is especi exploit by mr downham as a french
travel of high stand and well known in the zoolog museum of
franc but sad to sai when prof henri fairfield osborn cabl to the
museum of natur histori in pari inquir about mr laglaiz the
cabl flash back the on sad word inconnu unknown
i think it entir possibl that enough shed feather have been pick
up in the reek swamp of venezuela on the upper tributari of the
orinoco to afford an excus for the beauti stori of mr laglaiz
ani shrewd individu with monei and the influenc that monei secur
could put up just such a plant as i firmli believ ha been put up
by some on in venezuela i will guarante that i could accomplish such
a job in venezuela or brazil in four month time at an expens not
exceed on thousand dollar
that the great suppli of immacul perfect egret plume that annual
come out of venezuela could by ani possibl be pick up in the
swamp where thei were shed and drop by the egret is entir
preposter and incred the whole proport is denounc by
sever men of stand and experi none of whom ar inconnu

frenchmen quot by mr downham as absolut and thoroughli mislead
falsehood then there is no such thing in thi world as evid i
suggest a perus of the statement of the three frenchmen who ar
quot with such confid by mr downham and publish by the hon
chamber of commerc at london and then a care read of the
follow letter
averi island la june 17 1912
dear mr hornadai
i have befor me your letter of june 8th ask for inform as
to whether or no egret shed their plume at their nest place in
suffici quantiti to enabl them to be gather commerci i
most emphat wish to state that it is imposs to gather at
the nest place of these bird ani quantiti of their plume i
have nest within 50 yard of where i am now sit dictat
thi letter not less than 20000 pair of the variou speci of
heron and egret and there ar fulli 2500 pair of snowi heron
nest within my preserv
dure the nest season which cover the month of april mai and
june i am through thi heronri in a small cano almost everi dai
and often twice a dai i have had these heron under my close
inspect for the past 17 year and i have not in ani on season
pick up or seen more than half a dozen discard plume such
plume as i have pick up i have kept on my desk and given to the
peopl who were interest i rememb that last year i pick up
four plume of the snowi heron that were in on bunch i think these
must have been pluck out by the bird fight
thi year i have found onli on plume so far i enclos it herewith
you will notic that it is on of the shorter plume and is badli
worn at the end as have been all the plume which i have pick up
in my heronri
i am posit that it is not possibl for natur shed plume to be
gather commerci i have a number of time talk with plume
hunter from venezuela and other south american countri and i
have never heard of ani egret feather be gather by their be
pick up after the bird have shed them
i have heard of a number of heronri in south america that ar
protect by the land owner for the purpos of gather a yearli
crop of egret plume but thi crop is gather alwai by shoot a
certain percentag of the bird thi shoot is done by expert
with 22calibr rifl and doe not materi disturb the nest
coloni i have known of two men who have been engag in kill the
bird on larg estat in south america who were paid regular
salari for their servic as egret hunter
veri truli your
ea mcilhenni
i am more than will to set the abov against the fairi tale of mr
laglaiz
here is the testimoni of ah meyer an explumehunt who for nine
year work in venezuela hi sworn testimoni wa laid befor the
legislatur of the state of new york in 1911 when the new york
millin associ wa frantic endeavor to secur the repeal
of the splendid dutcher law thi wit wa produc by the nation
associ of audubon societi
my attent ha been call to the fact that certain commerci
interest in thi citi ar circul stori in the newspap and
elsewher to the effect that the aigrett us in the millineri trade
come chiefli from venezuela where thei ar gather from the ground in
the larg garcero or breedingcoloni of white heron
i wish to state that i have person engag in the work of
collect the plume of these bird in venezuela thi wa my busi
for the year 1896 to 1905 inclus i am thoroughli convers with
the method emploi in gather egret and snowi heron plume in
venezuela and i wish to give the follow statement regard the
practic emploi in procur these feather
the bird gather in larg coloni to rear their young thei have the
plume onli dure the mate and nest season after the period when
thei ar emploi in care for their young it is found that the plume
ar virtual of no commerci valu becaus of the worn and frai
condit to which thei have been reduc it is the custom in venezuela
to shoot the bird while the young ar in the nest a few feather of
the larg white heron american egret known as the garza blanca can
be pick up of a morn about their breed place but these ar of
small valu and ar known as dead feather thei ar worth local not
over three dollar an ounc while the feather taken from the bird
known as live feather ar worth fifteen dollar an ounc
my work led me into everi part of venezuela and colombia where these
bird ar to be found and i have never yet found or heard of ani
garcero that were guard for the purpos of simpli gather the
feather from the ground no such condit exist in venezuela the
stori is absolut without foundat in my opinion and ha simpli
been put forward for commerci purpos
the nativ of the countri who do virtual all of the hunt for
feather ar not provid in their natur and their practic ar of
a most cruel and brutal natur i have seen them frequent pull the
plume from wound bird leav the crippl bird to die of
starvat unabl to respond to the cri of their young in the nest
abov which were call for food i have known these peopl to tie
and prop up wound egret on the marsh where thei would attract the
attent of other bird fly by these decoi thei keep in thi
posit until thei die of their wound or from the attack of insect
i have seen the terribl red ant of that countri actual eat out
the ey of these wound helpless bird that were ti up by the
plumehunt i could write you mani page of the horror practic in
gather aigrett feather in venezuela by the nativ for the
millineri trade of pari and new york
to illustr the compar small number of dead feather which
ar collect i will mention that in on year i and my associ
ship to new york eighti pound of the plume of the larg heron and
twelv pound of the littl recurv plume of the snowi heron in thi
whole lot there were not over five pound of plume that had been
gather from the groundand these were of littl valu the
plumebird have been nearli extermin in the unit state and
mexico and the same condit of affair will soon exist in tropic
america thi extermin will come about becaus of the fact that the
young ar left to starv in the nest when the old bird ar kill ani
other statement made by interest parti to the contrari
notwithstand
i am so incens at the ridicul absurd and mislead stori that
ar be publish on thi question that i want to give you thi
letter and befor deliv it to you shall take oath to it
truth
here is the testimoni of mr caspar whitnei of new york formerli
editor of out magazin and outdoor america

which is the greatest slaughter of white heron for their plumag or
more specif for the marit plume which ar carri onli in the
mate and breed season and ar known in the millineri trade as
aigrett
there is liter no room for question the snowi heron ar kill
exactli as i describ it is the custom of all those who hunt for the
millineri trade and is recogn by the nativ as the usual method
here is the testimoni of mr julian a dimock of peekamos ny the
famou outdoor photograph and illustr of florida enchant
i know a goodli number of the plumehunt of florida i have camp
with them and talk to them i have heard their tale and even full
account of the shootingup of an egret rookeri never ha a man in
florida suggest to me that plume could be obtain without kill
the bird i have known the warden and have visit rookeri after
thei had been shotup and the evid all point to the everlast
us of the gun it is certainli not true that the plume can be
obtain without kill the bird bear them
nineteen year ago i visit the cuthbert rookeri with on of the men
who discov the bird nest in that lake he and hi partner had
sold the plume gather there for more than a thousand dollar he
show me how thei hid in the bush and shot the bird he even gave me
a chanc to watch him kill two or three bird
i know person the man chiefli respons for the slaughter of the
bird at allig bai he laugh at the idea of get plume
without kill the bird i well know the man who shot the bird up
roger river and even saw some of the empti shell left on the ground
by him
illustr young egret unabl to fly starv
the parent bird had been kill by plume hunter
illustr snowi egret dead on her nest
wound in the feedingground and came home to die photograph in a

societi
i have camp with seminol white black outlaw and those within
the pale connect with plumehunt and all tell the same stori
the bird ar shot to get the plume the evid of my own ey and
the action of the bird themselv convinc me that there is not a
shadow of doubt concern thi point
thi sworn testimoni from mr tj ash of kei west florida is veri
direct and to the point
i have seen mani moult and drop feather from wild plume bird i
have never seen a moult or drop feather that wa fit for anyth
it is the except when a plume bird drop feather of ani valu while
in flight whatev feather ar so drop ar those that ar frai
worn out and forc out by the process of moult the moult season
is not dure the hatch season but is after the hatch season the
shed or moult take place onc a year and dure thi moult
season the feather after have the hard usag of the year from wind
rain and other caus when drop ar of absolut no commerci
valu
mr arthur t wayn of mount pleasant sc relat in sworn testimoni
hi experi in attempt to secur egret plume without kill the
bird
it is utterli imposs to get fifti egret plume from ani coloni of
breed bird without shoot the bird last spring i went twice a
week to a breed coloni of american and snowi egret from earli in
april until june 8 despit the fact that i cover mile of territori
in a boat i pick up but two american egret plume which i now have
but not a singl snowi egret plume did i see nor did my companion who
accompani me on everi trip
i saw an american egret plume on the water and left it purpos to
see whether it would sink or not upon visit the place a few dai
afterward the plume wa not in evid undoubtedli have sunk the
plume ar chiefli shed in the air while the bird ar go to or
come from their breed ground if that millineri plume law is
repeal the fate of the american and snowi egret is seal for the
few bird that remain will be shot to the veri last on
ani man who ever ha been in an egret rookeri and i have know that
the abov testimoni is true the french stori of the beauti and
smoothlyrun egret farm in venezuela is preposter save for a
mere shadow of truth i do not sai that no egret plume could be
pick up but i do assert that the total quantiti obtain in on
year in that wai would be utterli trivial
no the osprei of the british feather market come from slaughter
egret and heron kill in the breed season let the british
public and the british parliament make no mistak about that if thei
wish the trade to continu let it be base on the impregn ground
that the merchant want the monei and not on a fantast dream that is
too silli to deceiv even a child that know bird
the us or disus of wild bird plumag as millineri ornament is
anoth of those wildlif subject regard which there is no room for
argument to assert that the featherdeal want the busi for the
monei it bring them is not argument we have seen mani a steam roller
go over truth and right and justic by main strength and redhot
power but truth and right refus to stai flat down there is on thi
earth not on wildanim speciesmamm bird or reptilethat can
long withstand exploit for commerci purpos even the whale of
the deep sea the walru of the arctic region the condor of the and
and allig of the everglad morass ar no except to the
univers rule
in mr downham book there is much fallaci reason and mani
conclus that ar not born out by the fact for exampl he sai
that no speci of bird of paradis ha been diminish in number by
slaughter for the feather trade that florida still contain a suppli of
egret that the decreas in bird life should be charg to the spread
of citi town and farm and not to the trade that the trade wa in
no wai respons for the slaughter of three hundr thousand gull
and albatross on laysan island
i have space to notic on other import erron conclus that mr
downham publish in hi book on page 105 he sai
the destruct of bird in foreign countri is someth that no
trade can direct or control
thi is an amaz declar and absolut contrari to experi
let me prove what i sai by a fresh and incontest illustr
prior to april 1911 when governor dix sign the bayn law against the
sale of wild nativ game in the state of new york currituck counti
nc wa a vast slaughterpen for wild fowl no power or persuas had
avail to induc the peopl of north carolina to check or regul or
in ani manner mitig that slaughter of gees duck and swan it wa
estim that two hundr thousand wild fowl were annual slaughter
there
we who advoc the bayn law said close the new york market against
currituck bird and you will stop a great deal of the slaughter
we clean our augean stabl the greatest game market in america wa
absolut close
last winter 1911 the annual kill of wild fowl wa fulli fifti per
cent less than dure previou year in on small town twenti
profession duck shooter went entir out of businessbecaus thei
couldnt sell their duck the dealer refus to bui them the result
wa exactli what we predict it would be and thi year it is report
over and over that duck ar more plenti in new england than thei
have been in twenti year previous the result is wonder becaus
so quick
beyond all question the feather merchant of london pari and berlin
absolut control the birdkil of venezuela china new guinea
mexico and south america let the word go forth that the trade is no
longer permit to bui and sell egret and heron plume skin of bird
of paradis and condor feather and presto the kill industri fall
dead the next moment
illustr miscellan bird skin 8 cent each
purchas by the new york zoolog societi from the quarterli sale in
london august 1912
ye inde member of the british parliament it is easili within
your power to wipe out at a singl stroke fulli onehalf of the bird
slaughter for fanci feather it can be done just as we wipe out
onehalf the annual duck slaughter in wickedlywast north carolina
the feather trade absolut doe control the kill situat now
will the peopl of england clean hous by control the feather trade
if a hundr speci of the most beauti bird of the world must be
extermin for the feather trade let the odium rest elsewher than on
the peopl of england
the birdlov of america mai rest assur that the birdlov of
englanda mighti hostar neither careless nor indiffer regard
the wildbird plumag busi on the contrari sever bill have
been brought befor parliament intend to regul or prohibit the
traffic and a measur of vast import to the bird of the world is
now befor the hous of common it is back by mr perci alden mp
by the royal societi for the protect of bird by the selbourn
societi and by mr jame bucklanda host in himself for year past
that splendidlyequip and wellmanag royal societi ha wage
ceaseless warfar for the bird it activ ha been tremend and
it membership list contain mani of the finest name in england the
address of the honorari secretari frank e lemon esq is 23 queen
ann gate london sw
natur these influenc ar oppos by the textil trade section of
the london chamber of commerc and their onli argument consist of the
plea that if london doesnt get the monei out of the feather trade the
contin will get it a reason logic magnific and convinc
excus for wholesal bird slaughter truli
mr buckland ha been inform from the contin that the peopl of
franc germani the netherland and belgium ar wait and watch to

chapter xv
unfair firearm and shoot ethic
for consider more than a centuri the state of the american union
have enact gameprotect law base on the principl that the wild
game belong to the peopl and the peopl senat repres
and legisl gener mai therefor enact law for it protect
prescrib the manner in which it mai and mai not be taken and
possess the sound of thi principl ha been fulli confirm by
the suprem court of the unit state in the case of geer vs
connecticut on march 2 1896
the tendenc of predatori man to kill and captur wild game of all kind
by wholesal method is as old as the human race the dai of the club
the stone ax the bow and arrow and the flintlock gun were
contemporan with the dai of great abund of game now that the
advent of breechload repeat automat and fix ammunit ha
render game scarc in all local save a veri few the thought
man is driven to consid measur for the check of destruct and
the suppress of wholesal slaughter
first of all the deadli float batteri and sailboat were
prohibit todai a punt gun is justli regard as a relic of
barbar and ani man who us on place himself beyond the pale of
decent sportsmanship or even of modern pothunt strang to sai
although the unwritten code of ethic of english sportsmen is veri
strict the english to thi dai permit wildfowl hunt with gun of
huge calibr some of which ar more like shotcannon than shotgun
and thei sai well there ar still wild duck on our coast
beyond question it is now high time for the english peopl to take up
the shotgun question and consid what todai is fair and unfair in
the kill of waterfowl the suppli of british duck and gees can not
forev withstand the market gunner and their shotcannon ha not the
british wildfowl suppli greatli decreas dure the past fifteen
year i strongli suspect that a care investig would reveal the
fact that it ha diminish the societi for the preserv of the
fauna of the empir should look into the matter and obtain a seri of
report on the condit of the waterfowl todai as compar with what
it wa twenti year ago
in the unit state we have elimin the swivel gun the punt gun
and the verybigbor gun among the real sportsmen the tendenc is
steadili toward shotgun of small calibr especi under 12gaug
but outsid the rank of sportsmen we ar now face to face with two
automat and five pump shotgun of deadli effici of these more
than on hundr thousand ar be made and sold annual by the five

the ethic of shoot and shotgunsar the american peopl will
that their wild bird shall be shot by machineri
in the ethic of sportsmanship the angler of america ar mile ahead
of the men who handl the rifl and shotgun in the hunt field will
the hunter ever catch up
the angler have steadili diminish the weight of the rod and the size
of the line and thei have prohibit the us of gang hook and net in
thi respect the initi of the tuna club of santa catalina is worthi
of the highest admir even though the leap tuna the jewfish and
the swordfish ar big and power the club ha elect to rais the
standard of sportsmanship by make captur more difficult than ever
befor a higher degre of skill and nerv and judgment is requir in
the angler who would make good on a big fish and incident the
fish ha about doubl the show that it had fifteen year ago
that is sportsmanship
but how is it with the men who handl the shotgun
by them the tuna club highclass principl ha been exactli revers
in the make of fishingrod commerci plai small part but in
about forti case out of everi fifti the make of gun is sole a
matter of dollar and profit
except the condemn of automat and pump gun i think that few
club of sportsmen have laid down law design to make shoot more
difficult and to give the game more of a show to escap thousand of
gentlemen sportsmen have their own separ unwritten code of honor
but so far as i know few of them have been written out and adopt as
bind rule of action i know that among expert wing shot it is an
unwritten law that quail and grous must not be shot on the ground nor
duck on the water but among the three million gunner who annual
shoot in the unit state how mani think you ar there who in actual
practic observ ani sentiment principl when in the presenc of
killabl game i should sai about on man and boi out of everi five
hundr
up to thi time the great mass of men who handl gun have left it to
the gunmak to make their code of ethic and hand them out with the
load cartridg all readi for us
for fifti year the maker of shotgun and rifl have tax their
ingenu and resourc to make kill easier especi for amateur
sportsmenand take still greater advantag of the game look at

the output of 1911at a recent hear befor a committe of the
hous of repres at washington a repres of the
gunmak industri report that in the year 1911 ten american
manufactur concern turn out the follow
391875 shotgun
666643 rifl and
580042 revolv
there ar 66 factori produc firearm and ammunit emploi
39377000 of invest capit and 15000 employe
the sole and domin thought of mani gunmak is to make the veri
deadliest gun that human skill can invent sell them as fast as
possibl and declar dividend on their stock the remington
winchest marlin steven and union compani ar engag in a mad
race to see who can turn out the deadliest gun and the most of them
on the market todai there ar five pumpgun that fire six shot each
in about six second without remov from the shoulder by the quick
slide of a sleev under the barrel that eject the empti shell and
insert a load on there ar two automat that fire five shot each
in five second or less by five pull on the trigger the
autoload gun is reload and cock again wholli by it own recoil
now if these ar not machin gun what ar thei
in view of the great scarciti of feather game and the number of
deadli machin gun alreadi on the market the product of the last
and deadliest automat gun by the winchest arm compani alreadi
in great demand is a crime against wild life no less
everi human action is a matter of tast and individu honor
it is natur for the duckbutch of currituck to love the automat
shotgun as thei do becaus thei kill the most duck per flock with
two of them in hi boat hold ten shot on expert duckkil
canand sometim actual doe so it is saidget everi duck out
of a flock up to seven or eight
it is natur for an awkward and blunder wingshot to love the
deadliest gun in order that he mai make as good a bag as an expert shot
can make with a doublebarrel gun it is natur for the hunter who
doe not care a rap about the extermin of speci to love the gun
that will enabl him to kill up to the bag limit everi time he take
the field it is natur for men who dont think or who think in
circl to sai so long as i observ the law bag limit what
differ doe it make what kind of a gun i us
it is natur for the remington and winchest and marlin gunmak
to sai as thei do enforc the law shorten the open season reduc
the bag limit and then it wont matter what gun ar us butdont
touch autoload gun dont hamper invent geniu
is it not high time for american sportsmen to ceas take their moral
principl and their code of ethic from the gunmak
here is a question that i would like to put befor everi hunter of game
in america
in view of the alarm scarciti of game in view of the impend
extermin of speci by legal hunt can ani highmind
sportsman can ani good citizen either sell a machin shotgun or
us on in hunt
a gentleman is incap of take an unfair advantag of ani wild
creatur therefor a gentleman cannot us punt gun for duck dynamit
for game fish or automat or pump gun in birdshoot the machin
gun and silenc ar grossli unfair and like ganghook net and
dynamit for trout and bass their us in hunt must everywher be
prohibit by law time have chang and the line for protect must
be more tightli drawn
illustr the champion game slaughter case
on hour slaughter 218 gees with two automat shotgun
the suprem court of pennsylvania judg orladi ha decid that the
pennsylvania law against the us of automat gun in hunt is
entir constitut becaus everi state ha a right to sai how it
game mai and mai not be kill
it is up to the american peopl to sai now whether their wild life
shall be slaughter by machineri or not
if thei ar will that it should be then let us be consist and
sayawai with all conserv the game conserv can endur a
gameless and birdless contin quit as well as the averag citizen
can
how thei workther ar a few apologist for the automat and pump
gun who cheerfulli sai so long as the bag limit is observ what
differ doe it make how the bird ar kill
it is strang that a conscienti man should ask such a question when
the answer is appar
we repli the differ is that an automat or pump gun will kill
fulli twice as mani waterfowl as a doublebarrel if not more and it
is highli undesir that everi gunner should get the bag limit of
bird or ani number near it the bird can not stand it moreov
the best state for duck and gees have no bag limit on those bird
todai on currituck sound for exampl the market hunter ar kill
all the waterfowl thei can sell on marsh island louisiana on man ha
kill 369 duck in on dai and anoth market gunner kill 430 in on
dai
the automat and the pump shotgun ar the favorit weapon of the
gamehog who make a specialti of gees and duck it is no uncommon
thing for a gunner who shoot a machin gun to get with on gun as
high as eight bird out of on flock a man who ha himself done thi
ha told me so

pleas notic the automat shotgun
februari 5th i and a friend were at on of the glenn counti club

commenc on arriv at the scene we notic hole which had been dug
in the ground just larg enough for a man to crawl into these hole
were us for hide place and were deep enough so the sportsmen would
be entir out of sight of the game the bird ar so wild that to move
a finger will frighten them
the decoi ar wild gees which had been crippl and tame for thi
purpos thei ar place insid of silk net fenc which ar locat on
each side of the hole dug for hide place these net ar the color
of the ground and it is imposs for the wild gees fly overhead to
detect the differ
after we had investig everyth the expert caller and owner of the
outfit exclaim into your hole
we notic in the distanc a flock of gees come our caller in a few
second had their attent and thei head toward our decoi soon
thei were directli over us but out of easi rang of our gun we were
anxiou to shoot but in obedi to our boss had to keep still and
soon notic that the bird were soar around and in a short time were
within fifteen or twenti feet of us at that moment we heard the
command punch em and the bombard that follow wa beyond
imagin we had fire five shot apiec and found we had bag ten
gees from thi on flock
at the end of on hour shoot we had 218 bird to our credit and
were out of ammunit
on find that no more shell were in our pit we took our dead gees
to the camp and return with a new suppli of ammunit we remain in
the pit dure the entir dai when the sun had gone behind the
mountain we sum up our kill and it amount to 450 gees

sail in over my decoi i rose to the occas and the leader
upend and tumbl in among the decoi the other bird unabl to stop
quick enough came directli over me he close hi wing and struck the
ground in the rear of the blind
more and more follow sometim thei came singli and then in two

possibl whenev there wa a lull in the flight i went out in the boat
and pick up the dead leav the wound to take chanc with ani
gunner lucki enough to catch them in open and smooth water a bird handi

round up the crippl we found we had twentyon gees i have heard
of bigger kill out in thi countri but never posit knew of

so then those two gunner averag 1012 wild gees per pump gun out
of on flock and yet there ar wise and reflect sportsmen who sai
what differ doe the kind of gun make so long as you live up to the
law
i think that the pump and automat gun make about 75 percent of
differ against the game that is all
the number of shotgun now in us in the unit state is almost beyond
belief about six year ago a gentleman interest in the manufactur of
such weapon inform me and hi statement ha never been disput

dear sir
regard the us of the automat shotgun would sai that i am a
member of two southern duck club where these gun ar us veri
extens i have seen a flock of duck come into a blind where
on two or even three of these gun were in us and have seen as
mani as eleven shot pour into a singl flock
we have consider poach on on of these club the territori
be so extens that it is imposs to prevent it we own
60000 acr and these poacher i am told nearli all us the
automat gun thei frequent kill six or eight duck out of on
flockfirst take a rake shot on the water and then get in
the balanc of the magazin befor the flock is out of rang in
fact some of them carri two gun and ar abl to discharg a part
of the second magazin into the same flock
as i told you the other even i am not so much against the gun
when in the hand of gentlemen and real sportsmen but on account
of it terribl possibl for market hunter i believ that the
onli safe wai is to abolish it entir and that the better class
should be will to give up thi weapon as be the onli mean of
put a stop to thi will game slaughter

the english 3barrel scatter rifl for ducksal gunner who find

invent and manufactur a 3barrel rifl special intend to kill
duck that ar beyond the reach of a chokebor shotgun the weapon
discharg all three barrel simultan in the london field of

hi ident under a nomdeplum after a trial of 48 shot the writer
declar that the 3barrel is a realli practic weapon and that
with it on could bag wildfowl that were quit out of reach of ani
shotgun just why a gatl gun or a maxim should not be emploi for
the same purpos the writer fail to state the us of either would be
quit as sportsmanlik and as fair to the game there ar great
possibl in duck mortar also
the sundai guna new weapon of peculiar form and great deadli
to song bird ha recent come into us becaus of the manner of it
us it is known as the sundai gun it is special adapt to
conceal on the person a man could go through a recept with on
of these deadli weapon absolut conceal under hi dress coat it is
a weapon with two barrel rifl and shot and it enabl the user to
kill anyth from a hummingbird up to a deer what the shotbarrel can
not kill the rifl will it is not a gun that ani sportsman would own
save as a curios or for target us
the state ornithologist of massachusett mr eh forbush inform me
that alreadi the sundai gun ha becom a scourg to the bird life of
that state thousand of them ar us by men and boi who live in

the sundai gun is on sale everywher and it is said to be in us both
by american and italian killer of songbird it weigh onli two

thi weapon on songbird swallow woodpeck nuthatch rabbit
and squirrel and like other crimin hide both weapon and loot in
their cloth so long as thi gun is in circul no small bird is
safe at ani season near ani citi or town
now what ar the peopl go to do about it

the penalti for hunt with ani gun special adapt to conceal
should be not less than 50 fine or two month imprison at hard

the present and futur of north american big game
the subject of thi chapter open up a vast field of fact and

without attempt to prove our statement by the product of detail
evid
to sai that all over the world the larg land mammal ar be
destroi more rapidli than thei ar breed would not be liter
true for the reason that there ar yet mani area that ar almost
untouch by the destroi hand of civil man it is true howev
that all the unspoil area rapidli ar grow fewer and smaller it
is also true that in all the region of the earth that ar easili
penetr by civil man the wild life is be kill faster than
it breed and of necess it is disappear thi is why the british
ar now so urgent bestir themselv to creat game preserv in
all the countri that thei own
it is on of the inexor law of natur to which i know of not on
except that larg hoof anim which live on open plain on open
mountain or in region that ar thinli forest alwai ar easili
found and easili extermin all such anim have a weak hold on
life thi is becaus it is so difficult for them to hide and so veri
easi for man to creep up within the kill rang of modern highpow
longrang rifl is it not piti to think of anim like the
carib moos white sheep and bear try to surviv on the nake
ridg and bald mountain of yukon territori and alaska with a modern
rifl the greatest duffer on earth can creep up within kill distanc
of ani of the big game of the north
the grai wolf is practic the onli larg anim that is abl to hide
successfulli and surviv in the treeless region of the north but hi
room is alwai prefer to hi compani becaus he too is a
destroy of big game
i am tempt to try to map out roughli what ar todai the unopen and
undestroi wild haunt of big game in north america in do thi
howev i warn the reader not to be deceiv into think that becaus
game still exist in those region those area therefor constitut a
perman preserv and safe breedingground for larg mammal that is
veri veri far from be the case the further open up of the
wilder area as i shall call them for conveni can and sure
will quickli wipe out their big game for throughout ninetenth of
those area it hold to life by veri slender thread
todai the unopen and undestroi wilder area of north america
wherein larg mammal still live in a normal wild state ar in gener
as follow
the arctic barren ground or arctic prairi north of the limit of
tree embrac the barren ground of northern canada the great arctic
archipelago ellesmer melvil and grant land and greenland thi

i have necessarili omit all those region of the unit state and
canada that still contain a remnant of big game but have been liter
shot to piec by gunner
in the unit state and southern canada there ar about fifteen
local which contain a suppli of big game suffici that a
conscienti sportsman might therein hunt and kill on head per year
with a clear conscienc all other should be close for five year
here is the list of avail and regard it there will be about as
mani opinion as there ar biggam sportsmen
hunt ground in and near the unit state and southern canada
wherein it is right to hunt big game
the main wood well stock with whitetail deer
new brunswick well stock with moos a few carib deer and black
bear
white mountain of new hampshir and vermont for deer
the adirondack new york well stock with whitetail deer onli
pennsylvania mountain contain mani deer and black bear and soon will
contain more
northern minnesota deer and moos
northern michigan and wisconsin whitetail deer
northwestern wyom thousand of elk in fall and winter a few deer
grizzli and black bear but no sheep that it would be right to kill
western and southwestern montana elk in season mule and whitetail

southern british columbia goat a few sheep and deer grizzli bear
moos carib and elk should not be kill
northern british columbia six fine speci of big game
northwestern alberta grizzli bear bighorn and mountain goat
under exist condit i regard the abovenam hunt ground as
nearli all in which it is right or fair for biggam hunt now to be
permit even on a strict basi nearli all other should immedi
be close for larg game for ten year
of cours such a proceed if carri into effect would provok loud
protest from sportsmen gunner gamehog pothunt and other but
i onli wish to high heaven that we had the power to carri such a program
as that into effect then we would see some game in ten year and our
grandchildren would thank us for some real biggam protect at a
critic period
except in the few local abovement i regard the biggam
situat in the unit state and southern canada as particularli
desper unless there is an immedi and complet revolut in thi
countri from an era of slaughter to an era of preserv as sure as
the sun rise on the morrow outsid of the hard and fast game
preserv and place like main and the adirondack thi gener of
american and nearamerican will live to see our countri swept clean
of big game
two year ago i did not believ thi but i do now it is imposs to
exagger the wide extent or the serious of thi situat in a
countri where ani and everi individu can rise and bluster
imjustasgoodasyouar and bellow for hi right as a
taxpay there is no stop the million who kill whenev there
is an open season and to mani american no right is dearer than the
right to kill the game which by even the commonest law of equiti
belong not to the shooter exclus but partli to two thousand
other person who dont shoot at all
unless we come to an about face in quick time all our big game
outsid the preserv is doom to sure and quick extermin thi is
not an individu opinion mere it is a fact and a hundr
thousand men know it to be such
last winter 191112 becaus the deer of montana were driven by cold
and hunger out of the mountain and far down into the ranchmen
vallei eleven thousand of them were ruthlessli slaughter state
game warden avar sai that often head of famili took out as mani
licens as there were person in the famili and the whole quota wa
kill such peopl deserv to go deerless into the futur but we can
not allow them to rob innoc peopl
our speci of big game
the pronghorn antelop uniqu and wonder will be on of the
first speci of north american big game to becom total extinct we
mai see thi come to pass within twenti year thei can not be bred in

caprici and easili upset thei die liter at the drop of a hat
thei ar quit subject to actinomycosi lumpyjaw which in wild

alreadi all the state that possess wild antelop except nevada have
pass law give that speci long close season which is highli
credit to the state that have done their duti nevada must get in

in 1908 dr ts palmer publish in hi annual report of progress in

a strike illustr of the decreas of the antelop is afford by
colorado in 1898 the state warden estim that there were 25000 in

diminish thi is inde seriou new the exist band alreadi
small ar steadili grow smaller the antelop ar kill lawlessli
and the crime of such slaughter ar in nearli everi instanc
successfulli conceal
previous we have base strong hope for the preserv of the
antelop speci on the herd in the yellowston park but those anim
ar vanish fearfulli fast in 1906 dr palmer report that about
fifteen hundr antelop came down to the feed ground near the
haystack in the vicin of gardin in 1908 the yellowston park
wa credit with two thousand head todai the number aliv by
actual count is onli five hundr head and thi after twentyf

here is a reliabl report june 29 1912 regard the pronghorn
antelop in lower california from ew nelson antelop formerli

gone from a larg part of their ancient rang and their steadili
decreas number indic their earli extinct throughout the

in captiv the antelop is exasperatingli delic and shortliv it
ha about as much stamina as a pet monkei as an exhibit anim in
zoolog garden and park it is a failur for it alwai look fade
spiritless and dead like a stuf anim readi to be thrown into the

even suspect that it is confin
two seriou attempt have been made to transplant and acclimat the
antelopein the wichita nation bison rang in oklahoma and in the
montana bison rang at raval in 1911 the boon and crockett club
provid a fund which defrai the expens of ship from the
yellowston park a small nucleu herd to each of those rang eight
were sent to the wichita rang of which five arriv aliv of the
seven sent to the montana rang four arriv aliv and were duli set
free while it seem a piti to take specimen from the yellowston park
herd the disagre fact is that there is no other sourc on which to
draw for breed stock
the provinc of alberta and saskatchewan in canada still permit the
hunt and kill of antelop which is wholli and entir wrong
the bighorn sheepof north american big game the bighorn of the

outsid of protect area in the unit state that event is fast

killabl sheep in our countri but the game is nearli alwai young ram
under five year of ag
that wyom montana idaho and washington still continu to permit
sheep slaughter is outrag their answer is that the sportsmen wont
stand for stop it altogeth i will addand the great mass of
peopl ar too crimin indiffer to take a hand in the matter and
do their duti regardless of the men of blood
the seed stock of bighorn sheep now aliv in the unit state
aggreg a pitifulli small number after twentyf year of unbroken
protect in colorado dillon wallac estim after an investig
on the ground that the state possess perhap thirtyf hundr
head he credit montana and wyom with five hundr eachwhich i
think is far too liber a number i do not believ that either of those
state contain more than on hundr unprotect sheep at the veri
utmost limit if there ar more where ar thei
in the yellowston park there ar 210 head safe and sound and slowli
increas i can not understand why thei have not increas more
rapidli than thei have in glacier park now under perman protect
three guid on lake mcdonald in 1910 estim the number of sheep at

mountain and elsewher a remnant of possibl two hundr sheep and
washington ha onli what chemist call a trace it ha recent been
discov that california still contain a few sheep and in

in utah the bighorn speci is probabl quit extinct in arizona
there ar a few veri small band veri wide scatter thei ar in the
santa catalina mountain the grand canyon countri the gila rang and
the quitovaquita mountain near sonoyta but who can protect from
slaughter those arizona sheep absolut no on thei ar too few and
too wide scatter for the game warden to keep in touch with them
the prospector have them entir at their merci and the world well
know what prospector merci to edibl big game look like on the
ground it lead straight to the fryingpan the coyot and the
vultur
the lower california peninsula contain about five hundr mountain
sheep without the slightest protect save low desert mountain heat
and thirst but that is no real protect whatev those sheep ar too
fine to be butcher the wai thei have been and now ar be
butcher in 1908 i strongli call the attent of the mexican
govern to the situat and the departmento de fomento secur the
issu of an execut order forbid the hunt of ani big game in
lower california without the written author of the govern i am
sure howev that ow to the polit and militari upheav it
never stop the slaughter of sheep in such easi mountain as those of
lower california it is a simpl matter to extermin quickli all the
mountain sheep that thei possess the time for presid madero and hi
cabinet to inaugur seriou protect measur ha fulli arriv
both british columbia and alberta have even yet fine herd of bighorn
and we can count three larg game preserv in which thei ar protect
thei ar goat mountain park east kootenai district between the elk and
bull river the rocki mountain park near banff and waterton lake
park in the southwestern corner of alberta
in view of the number of men who desir to hunt them the bag limit on
bighorn ram in british columbia and alberta still is too liber by
half on ram per year for on man is quit enough quit as much so
as on moos is the limit everywher todai a big old ram is
regard by sportsmen as a much more desir and credit trophi
than a moos becaus moosekil is easi and the bag of an old
mountain ram in real mountain requir five time as much effort and
skill
the splendid high and rug mountain of british columbia and alberta
form an ideal home for the bighorn and mountain goat and it would be
an intern calam for that region to be denud of it splendid
big game with resolut intent and judici treatment that region can
remain a rich and valuabl hunt ground for five hundr year to
come under fals liber law it can be shot into a state of
complet desol within ten year or even less

guid regard the flesh of the goat as almost unfit for us as food and
far inferior to that of the bighorn these reason taken togeth
render the goat much less persecut by the sportsmen ranchmen and

thi indiffer toward goat that in 1905 mr john m phillip and hi

in 1905 a herd of twenti of the socal dwarf elk of the san joaquin
vallei california were taken to the sequoia nation park and place
in a fenc rang that had been establish for it on the kaweah river
the extermin of the wapiti began with the settlement of the
american coloni natur the largest anim were the on most
eagerli sought by the meathungri pioneer and the elk and bison were
the first game speci to disappear the colonist believ in the
surviv of the fittest and we ar glad that thei did the on thing
that a hungri pioneer cannot withstand istemptationin a form that
embrac five hundr pound of succul flesh and let it not be
suppos that in the eastern state there were onli a few elk the
pennsylvania salt lick were crowd with them and the earli writer
describ them as exist in immens band and great number
of cours it is imposs for wild anim of great size to exist in
countri that ar cover with farm villag and peopl under such
condit the wild and the tame cannot harmon it is a fact
howev that elk could exist and thrive in everi nation forest and
nation park in our countri and also on uncount hundr of
thousand of rough wild timber hill and mountain such as exist in
probabl twentyf differ state there is no reason except man
shortsight greed and foolish why there ar not todai on

the troubl isth greedi habit could not be induc to kill
onli the threeyearoldmal in the fall and let the cow calv and
breed bull alon by sensibl manag the rocki mountain the
sierra nevada and the coast rang would support enough wild elk to feed
a million peopl but we american seem utterli incap of maintain
anywher from decad to decad a larg and realli valuabl suppli of

american elk exist onli in small bandsmer remnant and sampl of
the million we could and should have
if thei could be protect and the surplu present kill accord
to some ration work system then everi nation forest in the
unit state should be stock with elk in view of the aw cost of
beef todai 1012 cent per pound in chicago on the hoof it is
high time that we should consid the rais of game on the public
domain on such line that it would form a valuabl food suppli without
diminish the valu of the forest
just now 1912 the american peopl ar sore puzzl by a remark
elk problem that each winter is present for solut in the jackson
hole countri wyom driven southward by the deep snow of winter the
elk thousand that in summer graze and grow fat in the yellowston park
march down into jackson hole to find in those vallei less snow and
more food now it happen that the best and most of the former winter
graze ground of the elk ar cover by fenc ranch as a result
the elk that strive to winter there about fifteen thousand head ar
each winter threaten with starvat and dure three or four winter

in order to provid adequ winter graze ground for the
yellowstonewyom elk it seem imper that the nation
govern should expend between 30000 and 40000 in bui back from
ranchmen certain area in the jackson vallei particularli a tract known
as the swamp and other on the surround foothil where the herd
annual go to graze in winter a measur to render thi possibl wa
present to congress in the winter of 1912 and without opposit an
appropri of 45000 wa made
the splendid photograph of the elk herd that recent have been made
by sn leek of jackson hole clearli reveal the fact that the herd
now consist chiefli of cow calv yearl and young bull with
small antler in on photograph show about twentyf hundr elk
there ar not visibl even half a dozen pair of antler that belong to
adult bull there should be a hundr thi condit mean that the
best bull with the finest head ar constantli be select and
kill by sportsmen and other who want their head and the young
immatur bull ar left to do the breed that alon will sustain the
speci
illustr hungri elk in jackson hole wyom
part of a herd of about 2500 head be fed on hai in the winter of
191011 note the absenc of adult bull copyright 1911 by sn
leek
it is a wellknown principl in stockbreed that sire should be
fulli adult of maximum strength and in the prime of life no
stockbreed in hi sens ever think of breed from a youth
immatur sire the result would be weak offspr not up to the
standard
thi inexor law of inherit and transmiss is just as much a
law for the elk moos and deer of north america as it is for domest
cattl and hors if the present condit in the wyom elk herd
continu to prevail for sever gener as sure as time goe on we
shall see a mark deterior in the size and antler of the elk
if the foundat principl of stockbreed ar correct then it is
imposs to maintain ani largemamm speci at it zenith of size
strength and viril by continu breed of the young and immatur
male by some sportsmen it is believ that through longcontinu
kill of the finest and largest male the red deer of europ have
been grow smaller but on that point i am not prepar to offer
evid
in regard to the inbreed of the elk herd in larg open park and
preserv throughout north america there ar posit no ill effect
to fear wild anim that ar close confin gener after
gener ar bound to deterior physic but with healthi wild
anim live in larg open rang feed and breed natur the
inbreed that occur produc no deterior
in the twin certainti of overpopul and deterior from
excess kill of the good sire we have to face two new problem of
veri decid import noth short of veri radic measur will
provid a remedi for the immedi futur i can offer a solut
while it seem almost imposs deliber to kill femal i think
that the present is a veri except case and on that compel us to
appli the pain remedi that i now propos
premis
1there ar at present too mani breed cow in the yellowston
herd
2there ar far too few good breed bull
conclusionfor five year entir prohibit the kill of adult
male elk and kill onli femal and young male thi would gradual
diminish the number of calv born each year by about 2500 and by the
end of five year it would reduc the number and the annual birth of
femal to a figur suffici limit that the herd could be
maintain on exist rang
corollaryat the end of five year stop kill femal and kill
onli young male thi plan would permit a larg number of bull elk to
matur and then the largest and strongest anim would do the
breedingjust as natur alwai intend shall be done
south america
of all the biggam region of the earth south america is the poorest
of hoof game she possess onli a dozen speci that ar worth the
attent of sportsmen and like all other anim life in that land of
littl game thei ar desper hard to find in south america you
must work your heart out in order to get either game or specimen that

at present we need not worri about the marsh deer the pampa deer the
guemal or the venado nor the tapir jaguar ocelot and bear all
these speci ar abundantli abl to take care of themselv and to
find and kill ani on of them is a man task in patagonia the nativ
do wastefulli slaughter the guanaco and there ar time also when
great number of guanaco come down in winter to certain mountain lake

mexico
about ten year more will see the extinct of the mountain sheep of
lower californiain the wake of the recent extermin mexican
sheep of the santa maria lake region in 1908 i solemnli warn the
govern of presid diaz and at that time the mexican govern
express much concern
it is a great piti that just now polit condit ar complet
estop wildlif protect in mexico but it is true if the code of
propos law that i drew up by request in 1908 and submit to
minist molina were adopt it would have a good effect on the fauna
of mexico
in mexico there is littl hoof game to killdeer of the whitetail
group seven or eight speci the desert mule deer the brocket the
pronghorn antelop the mountain sheep and the peccari the deer will
not so easili be extermin but the antelop and sheep will be
utterli destroi thei will be the first to go and i think thei can
not by ani possibl last longer than ten year is it not too bad
that mexico should permit her finest speci of hoof and horn game
to be obliter befor she awaken to the desir of
conserv the mexican could protect their small stock of big game
if thei would but in lower california thei ar leas huge tract of
land to cattl compani and thei permit the lesse to kill all the
wild game thei pleas on their leas land even with the aid of dog
thi is a viciou and fatal system and contrari to all the law of

chapter xvii
present and futur of north american big game
conclud
the whitetail deerfiv hundr year henc when the greed and
rapac of civil man ha complet the loot and ruin of the
contin of north america the whitetail deer will be the last
speci of our big game to be extermin it mental trait it size
it color and it habit all combin to render it the most persist of
our larg anim and the best fit to surviv it neither bawl nor
bugl to attract it enemi it can not be call to a sportsman like
the moos and it stick to it timber with rare and commend
close when it see a strang live thing walk erect it doe
not stop to stare and catch softnos bullet but dash awai in quest
of solitud
the worst shoot that i ever did or saw done at game wa at run
whitetail deer in the montana river bottom
for the reason given the whitetail exist and persist in a hundr
unit state local from which all other big game save the black
bear have been extermin for exampl in our adirondack the moos
were extermin year and year ago but the belov wilder call
the north wood still is popul by about 20000 deer and about
8000 ar kill annual the deer of main ar suffici numer
that in 1909 a total of 15879 were kill with some assist from
the thin sprinkl of moos and carib the deer of main annual
draw into that state for perman dedic a huge sum of monei
various estim at from 1000000 to 2000000 in spite of heavi
slaughter and vigor attempt at extermin by overshoot the
deer of northern michigan obstin refus to be wipe out
there is howev a larg group of state in which thi speci ha
been extermin the state compris it ar ohio indiana illinoi
iowa and adjac portion of seven other state
as if to shame the peopl of iowa a curiou deer episod is record
in 1885 wb cuppi of avoca iowa purchas five deer and place
them in a paddock on hi 600acr farm by 1900 thei had increas to 32
head and then on night some on kindli open the gate of their
enclosur and gave them the freedom of the citi mr cuppi made no
effort to captur them possibl becaus thei decid to annex hi farm
as their habitat when a neighbor led them with a bait of corn to their
owner door he declin to impound them on the ground that it wa
unnecessari
by 1912 those deer had increas to 400 and the portion of thi stori
that no on will believ is thi thei spread all through the suburb
and hinterland farm of avoca and the peopl not onli fail to
assassin all of them and eat them but thei actual kill onli a
few protect the rest and made pet of mani queer peopl those men
and boi of avoca nearli everywher els in the world that i know that
histori would have been end differ here in the east 90 per cent
of our peopl ar like the avocan but the other 10 per cent think onli
of slai and eat san merci san decenc san law now the state
of iowa ha taken hold to captur some of those deer and set them free
in other portion of the state
elsewher i shall note the quick and thorough success with which the
whitetail deer ha been brought back in vermont massachusett
connecticut and southern new york
no state have wast land cover with brush or timber need be without
the ubiquit whitetail deer give them a semblanc of a fair show
and thei will live and breed with surpris fecund and persist
if you start a park herd with ten doe soon you will have more deer
than you will know how to dispos of unless you market them under a
bayn law duli tag by the state in close confin thi speci
fare rather poorli in larg preserv it doe well but dure the
rut season the buck ar to be dread and those that develop
aggress trait should be shot and market thi is the onli wai in
which the deer park of england ar kept safe for unarm peopl

becom extinct in north america outsid of the protect portion of it

stare at the hunter have been and to the end will be it undo
possibl there ar now two of these deer in the unit state and
british columbia for everi 98 that exist forti year ago but no more
it is a deer of the bad land and foothil and it curios is fatal
the number of sportsmen who have hunt and kill thi fine anim in
it own wild and picturesqu badland is inde quit small it ha
been fourfifth extermin by the resid hunter and ranchman and
todai is found in the rocki mountain region most sparingli ten year
ago it seem right to hunt the socal rocki mountain blacktail in
northwestern montana becaus so mani deer were there it did not seem to
spell extermin now condit have chang sinc last winter
great slaughter in northwestern montana of 11000 hungri deer the
speci ha been so reduc that it is no longer right to kill mule deer
anywher in our countri and a univers close season for five year is
the duti of everi state which contain that speci
the real blacktail deer of the pacif coast odocoileu
columbianu is to most sportsmen of the rocki mountain and the east
actual less known than the okapi not on out of everi hundr of them
can recogn a mount head of it at sight it is a small
delicatelyform delicatelyantl understudi of the big mule deer
and now painfulli limit in it distribut it is the deer of
california and western oregon and it ha been so ruthlessli slaughter
that todai it is go fast as condit stand todai and without a
radic chang on the part of the peopl of the pacif coast thi veri
interest speci is bound to disappear it will not be persist
like the whitetail deer but in the heavi forest it will last much
longer than the mule deer
my inform regard thi deer is like the stock of specimen of it
in museum collectionsmeag and unsatisfactori we need to know in
detail how that speci is fare todai and what it prospect ar for
the immedi futur in 1900 i saw great pile of skin from it in the
fur hous of seattl and the sight gave me much concern
the carib generallyi think it is not veri difficult to forecast
the futur of the genu rangif in north america from the logic of
the condit of todai thank to the splendid mass of inform
that ha been accumul regard thi group we ar abl to draw
certain conclus i think that the carib of the canadian barren
ground and northeastern alaska will surviv in great number for at
least anoth centuri that the carib herd of newfoundland will last
nearli as long and that in fifti year or less all the carib of the
great northwestern wilder will be swept awai
the reason for these conclus ar by no mean obscur or
farfetch
in the first place the barrenground carib ar todai enorm
numerousundoubtedli run up into million it can not be possibl
that thei ar be kill faster than thei ar breed and so thei
must be increas their food suppli is unlimit thei ar protect
by two redoubt championsjack frost and the mosquito their
countri never will contain a great human popul the nativ ar so
few in number and so lazi that even though thei should becom suppli
with modern firearm it is unlik that thei ever will make a seriou
impress on the carib million the onli thing to fear for the
barrenground carib throng is diseasea factor that is beyond human
predict
it is reason certain that the barren ground never will be net by
railwaysunless gold is discov over a wide area the fierc cold
and hunger and the billion of mosquito of the barren ground will
protect the carib from the wholesal slaughter that civil man
joyous would inflictif he had the chanc
the carib thousand of newfoundland ar fairli access to sportsmen
and pothunt but at the same time the coloni govern can
protect them from extermin if it will alreadi much ha been done
to check the reckless and wick slaughter that onc prevail a bag
limit of three bull carib per annum ha been fix which is enforc
as to nonresid and sportsmen but in a wai that is much too
american it is often ignor by resid in touch with the game for
instanc the guid of a new york gentleman whom i know admit to my
friend that each year he kill about 25 carib for himself and hi
famili of four other person he explain thu when the inspector
come around i show him two carib hang in my woodsh but back in
the wood i have a littl shack where i keep the other until i want
them
the real sportsmen of the world never will make the slightest
percept impress on the carib of newfoundland for on thing
the hunt is much too tame to be interest if the carib of that
island ever ar extermin it will be strictli by the peopl of
newfoundland themselv if the govern will tighten it grip on the
herd thei need never be extermin
the carib of new brunswick quebec and ontario ar few and wide
scatter unless carefulli conserv thei ar not like to last long
for their countri is annual penetr in everi direct by arm
men white and red there is no mean by which it can be proven but
from the number of arm men in those region i feel sure that the
typic woodland carib speci is be shot faster than it is
breed the sportsmen and naturalist of canada and new brunswick
would render good servic by make a close and care investig of
that question
the carib of the northwestern wilder ar in a situat peculiarli
their own thei inhabit a region of nake mountain and thin forest
wherein thei ar conspicu easili stalk and easili kill nowher
do thei exist in larg herd of thousand or even of mani hundr
thei live in small band of from ten to twenti head and even those ar
far apart the region in which thei live is certain to be thoroughli
open up by railwai and exploit fifti year from now we will find
everi portion of the nowwild northwest fairli access by rail the
build of the railwai will be to the caribouand to other big
gameth dai of doom in that wild rough region no power on
earthsav that which might be abl to depriv all the inhabit
and all visitor of firearmscan possibl save the game outsid of a
few preserv that ar dilig patrol
the big game of the northwest region in which i includ the interior of
alaska will go it is onli a question of time alreadi the build
of the citi of fairbank and the exploit of the mine district
surround it have led to such harass and slaughter of the
migrat carib that the great herd which formerli travers the
tanana countri onc a year ha complet chang it migrat rout
and now keep much farther north the cross of the yukon near eagl
citi ha been abandon a hundr year henc the northwestern
wilder will be dot with town and crisscross with railwai
but the big game of it will be gone except in the preserv that ar
yet to be made thi will particularli involv the carib moos and
mountain sheep of all speci which will be the first to go the
mountain goat and the forest bear will hold out longer than their more
expos neighbor of the treeless mountain
the moosein the unit state the moos is found in five
statesmain minnesota montana wyom and idaho there ar 550 in
the yellowston park in main and minnesota onli mai moos be hunt
and kill in the season of 1909 184 moos were kill in mainea

northern minnesota we now possess a great nation moos preserv of
909743 acr and in 1908 mr fullerton after a person inspect in
which he saw 189 moos in nine dai estim the total moos
popul of the present dai at 10000 head thi is a moos preserv
worth while
outsid of protect area the moos is the anim that is most easili
extermin it trail is easili follow and it habit ar
thoroughli known down to three decim place as a hunter reward it
is great strang to sai new brunswick ha found that the moos is an
anim that it is possibl and even easi to protect the death of a
moos is an event that is not easili conceal wherev it is
thoroughli understood that the moos law will be enforc the wouldb
poacher paus to consid the net result to him of a jail sentenc
in new brunswick we have seen two strang thing happen dure our own
time we have seen the moos migrat into and perman occupi an
extens area that previous wa destitut of that speci at the
same time we have seen a reason number of bull moos kill by
sportsmen without disturb in the least the gener equanim of the
gener moos popul and at thi moment the moos popul of
new brunswick is almost incred everi moos hunter who goe there
see from 20 to 40 moos and two of my friend last year saw in round
number about 100 up to date the size of adult antler seem to be
maintain a high standard
in summer the photograph of moos in the river lake and pond of
main and new brunswick amount to an industri i am uneasi about the
constant pick off of the largest and best breed bull of the
mirimachi countri lest it final reduc the size and antler of the
moos of that region but onli the futur can tell us just how that
prospect stand todai
in alaska our ever thought and forehand biolog survei of the
depart of agricultur ha by legal proclam at on stroke
convert the whole of the kenai peninsula into a magnific moos
preserv thi will save alc giga the giant moos of alaska from
extermin and new brunswick and the minnesota preserv will save
alc americanu but in the northwest we can posit depend upon
it that eventu wherev the moos mai legal be hunt and kill
by ani tom dick or harri who can afford a twentydollar rifl and a
licens the moos sure will disappear
the moos law of alaska ar stricttoward sportsmen onli the miner
prospector and indian mai kill as mani as thei pleas for food
purpos thi open the door to a great amount of unfair slaughter
ani coffeecool can put a pan and pick into hi hunt outfit go out
after moos and call himself a prospector
i grant that the real prospector who is look for or and miner
with an intellig ey and know what he is do should have special
privileg on game to keep him from starv the settl miner
howev is in a differ class no miner should ask the privileg of
live on wild game ani more than should the farmer the steamboat man
the railwai labor or the soldier in an armi post the indian should
have no game advantag whatev over a white man he doe not own the
game of a region ani more than he own it miner or it waterpow
he should obei the gener game law just the same as white men in
africa as far as possibl the white popul wise prohibit the
nativ from own or us firearm and a good idea it is too i am
glad there is on contin on which the imjustasgoodasyouar
nightmar doe not curs the whole land
the muskoxnow that the north pole ha been safe discov and
the south pole ha becom the stormcent of polar explor the
harri muskox herd of the farthest north ar have a rest i think
that most american sportsmen have learn that as a sport proposit
there is about as much fun and glori in harri a muskox herd with
dog and pick off the member of it at parad rest as there is in
shoot rang cattl in a roundup the habit of the anim posit
elimin the real essenc of sportdifficulti and danger when a
muskox band is chase by dog or by wolv the fullgrown member of
it bull and cow alik instantli form a close circl around the
calv face outward shoulder to shoulder and stand at bai without
the aid of a gunner and a rifl such a format is invinc mr
paul rainei move pictur tell a wonder stori of anim
intellig braveri and devot to the parent instinct
for some reason the muskox herd do not seem to have percept
increas sinc man first encount them the number aliv todai
appear to be no greater than it wa fifti year ago and thi lead to
the conclus that the present delic balanc could easili be
disturb the wrong wai fortun it seem reason certain that
the indian of the canadian barren ground the eskimo of the far north
and the strai explor all live outsid the haunt of the speci and
come in touch onli with the edg of the muskox popul as a whole
thi lead us to hope and believ that through the difficulti
involv in reach them the main bodi of muskox of both speci
ar safe from extermin
at the same time the time ha come for canada the unit state and
denmark to join in formul a stiff law for the prevent of
wholesal slaughter of muskox for sport it should be render
imposs for anoth sportsman to kill twentythre head in on dai
as onc occur give the sportsman a bag of three bull and no more
to thi no true sportsman will object and the object of gamehog
onli serv to confirm the justic of the thing thei oppos
the grizzli bearto mani person it mai seem strang that anyon
should feel dispos to accord protect to such fierc predatori
anim as grizzli bear lion and tiger but the spirit of fair plai
spring etern in some human breast the sportsmen of the world do not

i am quit sure that if the extermin of the tiger from the whole of

the sportsmen of india the answer would be a thunder no sai
major j stevensonhamilton in hi anim life in africa it is
imposs to contempl the us against the lion of ani other weapon
than the rifl
the real sportsmen and naturalist of america ar decidedli oppos to
the extermin of the grizzli bear thei feel that the wild of north
america ar wide enough for the accommod of mani grizzli without
crowd the proletariat a rocki mountain without a grizzli upon it or
at least a bear of some kind is onli half a mountaincommonplac and
tame put on twoyearold grizzli cub upon it and presto everi cubic
yard of it local atmospher reek with romant uncertainti and
fearsom thrill
a few person have done consider talk and write about the
damag to stock inflict by bear but i think there is littl
justif for such charg certainli there is not onetenth enough
real damag done by bear to justifi their extermin at the present
time we hear that the farmer of kadiak island alaska ar be
serious harass and damag by the big kadiak bearan anim so
rare and shy that it is veri difficult for a sportsman to kill on i
think the charg against the bearsif the kadiak island ever
realli have made anyne to be proven by the product of real
evid
in the unit state outsid of our game preserv i know of not on
local in which grizzli bear ar suffici numer to justifi a

repres by monarch in golden gate park is almost if not wholli
extinct in montana outsid of glacier park it is useless to appli for
wild grizzli in the bitter root mountain and clearwat mountain of
idaho there ar grizzli but thei hide so effectu under the
snowbent willow on the slide that it is almost imposs to get a
shot northwestern wyom still contain a few grizzli but there ar
so mani squar mile of mountain around each anim it is now almost
useless to go hunt for them british columbia western alberta and
the coast mountain at least as far as skaguai and yukon territori
gener all contain grizzli and the sportsman who goe out for
sheep carib and moos is reason certain to see half a dozen bear
and kill at least on or two in those countri the grizzli speci
will hold forth long after all killabl grizzli have vanish from the
unit state
i think that it is now time for california montana washington oregon
idaho and wyom to give grizzli bear protect of some sort
possibl the situat in those state call for a fiveyear close
season even british columbia should now place a bag limit on thi
speci thi ha seem clear to me ever sinc two of my friend kill
in the spring of 1912 six grizzli in on week but provinci game
warden a bryan william sai that at present it would be imposs to
impos a bag limit of on per year on the grizzli of british columbia

in alaska there is some dissatisfact over the protect accord the
big brown bear but those rule ar right as far as thei go a
governor of alaska onc said to me the preserv of the game of
alaska should be left to the peopl of alaska it is their game and
thei will preserv it all right
the answer not by a long shot
onli three thing were wrong with the exgovernor view
1the game of alaska doe not belong to the peopl who live in
alaskawith the intent to get out tomorrow it belong to the
93000000 peopl of the nation
2the preserv of the alaskan fauna on the public domain should
not be left unreservedli to the peopl of alaska becaus
3a sure as shoot thei will not preserv it
congress is right in appropri 15000 for game protect in
alaska it is veri necessari that the regul for conserv the
wild life should be fix by the secretari of agricultur with the
advic of the biolog survei
the black bear is an interest citizen he harm nobodi nor anyth
he afford good sport he object to be extermin and wherev in
north america he is threaten with extermin he should at onc be
given protect a black bear in the wild is harmless in captiv
pose as a household pet he is decidedli danger and had best be
given the middl of the road in big forest he is a grand stayer and
will not be extermin from the fauna of the unit state until
washington is wreck by anarchist
the american bisoni regard the american bison speci as now
reason secur against extermin thi is due to the fact that it
breed persist and successfulli in captiv and to the great
effort that have been put forth by the unit state govern the

the present and futur of african game
thank to the dilig with which sportsmen and field naturalist have
record their observ in the haunt of big game it is not at all
difficult to forecast the immedi futur of the big game of the world
we mai safe assum that all land well suit to agricultur mine

result to the wild mammal and bird at the same time the game of the

on the other hand the unconquer forest jungl of certain portion
of the tropic will hold their own and shelter their fourfoot
inhabit for centuri to come
on the open mountain of the world and on the graze land most big
game is now be kill much faster than it breed thi is due to the
attack of five time too mani hunter open season that ar too long
and bag limit that ar far too liber as an exampl consid africa

mr arthur jordan ha seen much of the big game of british east africa

from what ha befallen in south africa we can easili and correctli
forecast the futur of the big game of british east africa and uganda
less than fifti year ago cape coloni natal zululand and everi
countri up to the zambesi wa teem with herd of big wild anim
just as the northern provinc now ar as late as 1890 when rhodesia
wa taken over by the charter compani and the capit citi of
salisburi wa stake out an american boi in the pioneer corp now
honor william harvei brown of salisburi wrote thu of the gwibi
flat near salisburi
that even i beheld on those flat a sight which probabl will never
again be seen there to the end of the world the varieti deploi
befor me wa almost incred there within the rang of my vision
were group of roan sabl and tsessebi antelop burchel zebra now
total extinct eland reedbuck steinbuck and ostrich it wa
like africa in the dai of livingston as i sat on my hors view
with amaz thi wonder panorama of wild life i wa startl by a
herd that came gallop around a small hill just behind meon the
south african frontier p 114
that wa in 1890 and how is it todai
salisburi is a modern citi endors by two line of railwai the gwibi
flat ar farm there is some big game yet in rhodesia south of the
zambesi but to find it you must go at least a week journei from the
capit to the remot corner that have not yet been convert into
farm or mine settlement north of the zambesi rhodesia yet contain
plenti of big game the victoria fall station is a popular start
point for hunt expedit head northeast and northwest in the
northwest the game is yet quit in a state of natur unfortun the
barots nativ of that region can procur from the portugues trader
all the firearm and ammunit that thei can pai for and by treati
thei retain their hunt right the final result will
beextermin of the game
elsewher throughout rhodesia the nativ ar not permit to have gun
and gunpowdera veri wise regul in alaska our indian ar
privileg to kill game all the year round and thei have modern
firearm with which to do it
and how is it with the game of that dai
the true burchel zebra is now regard as extinct in cape coloni

thei ar make game preserv liter everywher

the two in british east africa ar of enorm size and ar well

the abov show of the pitifulli small number of the specimen that
constitut the remnant of the biggam of the cape suggest just on
thinga univers close season throughout cape coloni and no hunt
whatev for ten year and yet what do we see
the report from which the abov censu wa taken contain half a column
of solid matter in small type give a list of the open season all
over cape coloni dure which kill mai be done so it seem that the
spirit of slaughter is the same in africa that it is in
americakil as long as there is anyth aliv to kill
thi list is of startl interest becaus it show how close the
small remnant of big game ar now mark down in south africa
in view of the success with which englishmen protect their game when
onc thei have made up their mind to do so it is fair to expect that
the herd now under protect as list abov will save their
respect speci from extinct it is alarm howev to note the
wide territori cover by the deadli open season and to wonder when
the bar realli will be put up
todai mashonaland is a verymuchsettl coloni the cape to cairo
railwai and train de lux long ago attain the pall of the zambesi
and now the curat of the salisburi museum will have to search
dilig in far off nyassaland and beyond the zambesi river to find
enough specimen to fill hi case with repres of the vanish
rhodesian fauna onc 1892 the white rhinocero wa found in northern
rhodesia but never again in salisburi eland and zebra ar nearli as
great a curios as thei ar in st loui
but for the discoveri of white rhinoceros in the lado district on the
western bank of the nile below gondokoro we would now be sai that
rhinocero simu is within about ten specimen of total extinct
from south africa as far up as salisburi in central rhodesia at least
99 per cent of the big game ha disappear befor the white man
rifl let him who doubt thi scan the censu of wild anim still
live in cape coloni
from all the other region of africa that ar easili access to
gunner the anim life is vigor be shot out and no man in hi
sens will now sai that the big game is breed faster than it is
be kill the revers is painfulli true mr carl akelei in hi
quest for a realli larg male eleph for the american museum found and
look over a thousand male without find on that wa realli fine
and typic all the photograph of eleph herd that were taken by
kermit roosevelt and akelei show a strike absenc of adult male and
of femal with long tusk there ar onli young male and young
femal with small short tusk the answer isth white ivori hunter
have kill nearli all the eleph bear good ivori
the slaughter of big game is go on furious in british east africa
becaus the uganda railwai open up the entir territori to hunter
anyon man or woman who can rais 5000 in cash can go there and make
a huge bag of big game with a licens cost onli 250 he can kill
enough big game to sink a ship
the bag limit in british east africa is ruinous extravag if the
govern desir the extermin of the game such a bag limit
sure will promot that end it is aw to think that for a petti sum
ani man mai bui the right to kill 300 head of hoof and horn
anim of 44 speci not count the carnivor anim that also
mai be kill that bag limit should immedi be reduc 75 per
cent
as matter stand todai in british east africa the big game of the
countri outsid the three preserv is absolut certain to
disappear in about onefourth of the time that it took south africa to
accomplish the same result the reason ar obvioussuperior
access more deadli rifl expert profession guid and a
widespread craze for kill big game with care and economi british
east africa should furnish good hunt for two centuri but as
thing ar go on todai twenti year will see a tremend chang
for the wors and a disappear of game that will liter astonish
the nativ
german east africa and uganda will not extermin their quota of big
game quit so soon the absenc of railwai is a great factor in

chapter xix
the present and futur of the game of asia
after a success surviv of man influenc through two thousand
year at last the big game of india ha made a good start on the road
to vanish up to 1870 it had held it own with a tenac that wa
astonish in 1877 i found the gangesjumna dooab the animallai
hill the wynaad forest and ceylon liter teem with herd of
game the animallai in particular were a hunter paradis in each dai
of hunt larg game of some kind wa a certainti the nilgiri hill
had been quit well shot out but in view of the veri small area and
open golflink charact of the whole top of that wonder sky
plateau that wa no caus for wonder
in those dai no nativ shikare own and oper a gunor at the
most veri veri few of them did if a rogu eleph a maneat tiger
or a nasti leopard becam a public nuisanc it wa a case for a sahib
to come and doctor it with a 577 doublebarrel express rifl worth
150 or more and the sahib had shoot galor
i think that no such great wildlif sight as those of the plateau
region of africa ever were seen in southern asia condit there ar
differ and usual the game is wide scatter the sambar deer and
muntjac of the dens forest the axi of the bamboo glade the thameng
deer of the burmes jungl the sladang or gaur of the aw malai
tangl and the big cat and canin will last long and well the
ibex markhor tahr and all the wild sheep eventu will be shot
out by sportsmen who ar sheep crazi the sheep and goat of asia will
disappear soon after the plain anim of africa becaus no big game
that live in the open can much longer endur the modern inexpens
longrang rifl of deadli accuraci and limitless repetit of fire
eventu i fear that by some unlucki turn of fortun wheel all the
nativ hunter of asia will obtain rifl and when thei do we soon
will see the end of the big game
even todai we find that the primit condit of 1877 have been
greatli chang in the first place about everi nativ shikare
hunter own a rifl at a cost of about 25 and mani other nativ
possess gun and assum to hunt with them the logic conclus of
thi is more hunt and less game the develop of the countri ha
reduc the cover for game new road and railwai have made the game
district easili access and real sportsmen ar now three or four
time as numer as thei were in 1877
at toonacadavoo in the animallai hill where thirtyf year ago
there modestli nestl on the ridg besid the river onli forest ranger
theobold bungalow built of mud and cover with grass thatch and
bamboo rat there is now a regular hill station light by electr
a modern sanatorium high up on the bluff a club golf link and
other modern improv in my dai there were exactli four gun on the
animallai now there ar probabl on hundr and it is easi to guess
how much big game remain on the delect mountain in comparison with
the golden dai of 1877 i should sai that there is now onli on game
anim for everi twentyf that were there in my dai
i am told that it is like that all over india beyond question the
gunsel and gunus have been busi there as everywher els the
game of india is on the toboggan slide and the old dai of abund
have gone forev
the first fact that strike us in the face is the impend fate of the
great indian rhinocero an anim as wonder as the titanother or
the megatherium it is like a gift hand down to us straight out of the
pleistocen ag a million year back the british paleontologist
todai marvel at elepha ganesa and by great labor dig hi bone out
of the sewalik rock but what on of them all ha yet made a move to
save rhinocero indicu from the quick extermin that soon will be
hi portion unless he is accord perpetu and real protect from the
assault of man
let the mammalogist of the world face thi fact the avail cover of
the indian rhinocero is alarmingli decreas throughout assam and
bengal where the behemoth of the jungl ha a right to live it is
believ that the few remain rhino ar be shot much faster then
thei ar breed and what will be the effect of thi upon an anim
that requir fourteen year to reach full matur todai the most
wonder hoof mammal of all asia is book for extermin and
unless veri radic measur for it preserv ar at onc carri
into effect it is probabl that twenti year more will see the last
indian rhino go down to rise no more on remedi would be a good ampl
rhinocero preserv and anoth the most absolut and perman
protect for the speci all along the line halfwai measur will
not suffic it is time to ring in a gener alarm
dure the past eighteen year onli three specimen of that speci
have come out of india for the zoolog garden and park of the
world and i think there ar onli five in captiv all told
we ar told that in india now the nativ ar permit to have about
all the firearm thei can pai for natur in a countri contain
over 300000000 peopl thi is a deadli thing of cours there ar
shoot regul mani of them but their enforc is so
imperfect that it is said that the nativ ar attack the big game on
all side with deadli effect i fear it is utterli imposs for the
indian govern to put enough warden into the field to watch the
do of the grand armi of nativ poacher
fortun the indian nativeunlik the western frontiersmando
not contend that he own the big game or that all men ar born free
and equal at the same time he mean to have hi full share of it to
eat and to sell in variou form for cash even in india the
saleofgam dragon ha rear it head and is todai in need of be
scotch with an iron hand
when i receiv direct from a friend in the nativ state of kashmir a
long print circular set forth the hunt law and gameprotect
measur of that veri interest princip it gave me a shock it
wa disquiet to be thu assur that the big game of kashmir ha
disappear to such an extent that strong protect measur ar
necessari it wa as if the chief eskimo of etah had issu a strong
proclam for the save of the muskox
in kashmir the destruct of game ha becom so seriou that a game
preserv depart ha been creat with the offici staff that
such an organ requir the game law ar print annual and
ani variat from them mai be made onli by the author of the
maharajah himself up to date eight game preserv have been creat
have a total area of about thee hundr squar mile in addit to
these there ar twelv small preserv each have an area of from
twentyf to fifti squar mile by their locat these seem to
provid for all the speci of big game that ar found in kashmirth
ibex two form of markhor the tahr himalayan bighorn sheep burrhel
and goral
in our countri we have sever state that ar veri larg veri
diversifi in surfac and still inhabit by larg game ha ani on
of those state creat a seri of game preserv even half wai
compar with those of kashmir i think not montana ha made a
begin with two preservessnow creek and the pryor mountainsbut
besid the splendid seri of kashmir thei ar not worthi of seriou
mention
and then follow close in the wake of that document came a lengthi
articl in the proceed of the zoolog societi of london by
ec steb in which a correspond of the indian field clearli
set forth the fact that the big game of the himalaya now is menac by
a peril new to our consider but of a most deadli charact hear
him
in thi inventori of game destroy in india the gurkha soldier
doe not find a place for he belong to a class which he ampli fill by
himself with hi small but veri import person he deserv
separ notic from the bank of the sarda on the frontier of nepal
to the bank of the indu the battalion of these gallant littl men
ar scatter in canton all along the outer spur of the himalayan
rang in seven or eight of these locat there ar at least 14000 of
these disciplin warrior who in the absenc of opportun for
spill human blood legitim ar given a free hand for
slaughter wild anim along fivehundr mile of the best hunt
ground of upper india
now sinc those fact must be true as report do thei not in
themselv constitut a sever arraign of the indian govern why
should that state of game slaughter endur when a singl execut
order to the co of each post would effectu stop it
in the make of game preserv or sanctuari as thei ar call out
there the govern of india ha shown rare and commend dilig
the total number is too great for enumer here the nativ state of
mysor ha seven and the nilgiri hill have sanctuari aggreg
about 100000 acr in area in the wynaad forest my old
huntingground at mudumallai have been close to bison shoot
becaus of the alarm decreas of bison gaur through shoot and
diseas the kundah forest reserv ha been made a partial game
preserv but the door might as well have been left wide open as so
wide ajar
in eastern bengal and assam sever game preserv have been creat
on the whole by the dilig and thorough with which sanctuari
as thei ar term have been creat quit gener throughout india
it is quit evid that the govern and the sportsmen of india have
becom thoroughli alarm by the great decreas of the game and the
danger of the extermin of speci in the past india ha been the
finest and beststock huntingground of all asia quit beyond

the destruct of bird in the far eastg
by c william beeb
curat of bird new york zoolog park
footnot g the observ which furnish thi valuabl chapter were
made by mr beeb in 1911 while conduct an expedit in southern
asia borneo and java for the purpos of studi in life and natur all
the member of the pheasant famili inhabit that region the result
of these studi and collect will shortli appear in a veri complet
monograph of the phasianidaewth
in chapter xiii treat of the extermin of bird for women
hat dr hornadai ha dealt fulli with the feather and plumag traffic
after it enter the broker hand and ha prove conclus that the
plume of egret ar gather from the freshli kill bird we mai
trace the cours of the plume and feather backward through the
tightlypack bale and box in the hold of the vessel to the port
of the savag land whenc thei were ship then to the skil dark
hand of mexican peon venezuelan indian african negro or asiat
chinaman or malai who strip the skin from the flesh and final to
the jungl or mountain side or terai where the bird gave up it life to
blowpip crossbow blunderbuss or carefulli set snare
in variou trip to mexico venezuela and other countri in the tropic
of the new world i have seen mani such scene but not until i had
complet a seventeen month expedit in search of pheasant through
some twenti wild countri of asia and the east indi did i realiz
the havoc which is be wrought week by week everywher on the globe
while we were absent even these few month from the great center of
civil tremend advanc had been made in airship and the
thousand and on other modern phase of human develop but evolut
in the world of natur as we observ it wa onli destructivea
worldwid katabolisma retrogress often discern from month to
month we could scarc repeat the trip and make the same observ
upon pheasant so rapidli is thi group of bird approach
extinct
the caus of thi destruct of wild life ar mani and divers and
resembl on anoth onli in that thei all eman from mankind to the
casual travel the shoot and trap of bird for millineri
purpos at first seem to hold an insignific place among the caus
but thi is onli becaus in mani of the larger port the protect
law ar more or less oper and the occup of the plume hunter
is carri on in secret wai but it is as farreach and insidi
as ani and when we add to the actual number of bird slain the
compound interest of egg grown cold of young bird perish slowli
from hunger of the thousand upon thousand of bird which fall wound
or dead among the thick tropic jungl foliag and ar lost the total
is on of ghastli proport
not to weaken my argument with too mani gener statement let me take
at onc some concret case first that of the himalayan pheasant and
gamebird in a recent interest articl by ep stebbingh the
past present and hopedfor futur of game bird and anim in india is
review unfortun howev most of the finest creatur in asia
live beyond the border of the british sphere of influenc and though
within sight ar absolut beyond reach of civil law the heart of
the himalayasth haunt of some of the most beauti bird in the
world the tragopan the blood and impeyan pheasantsli within the
limit of nepal a littl countri which time and time again ha bade
defianc to british attack and still maintain it independ from
it northern border mt everest look down from it most exalt of all
earthli summit and see vallei after vallei deplet of first on bird
and then anoth i have seen and live with nepales shepherd who have
noth to do month after month but watch their flock in the lofti
solitud time hang heavi on their hand and with true orient
patienc thei weav loop after loop of yakhair snare and then set
them not in dozen or score but in hundr and thousand up and down
the vallei
footnot h game sanctuari and game protect in india
proc zool soc london 1912 pp 2335
in on local seven great vallei had been complet clear of
pheasant onli a singl pair of tragopan remain and from on of
these littl brown men i took two hundr noos which had been prepar
for these lone survivor in these case the bird were either cook
and eaten at onc or sold to some pass shepherd or lama for a few
anna but in other part of thi unknown land systemat collect of
skin goe on for bale after bale of impeyan and red argu tragopan
pheasant skin goe down to the calcutta wharv where it infam
content though known ar safe from seizur under the nepal raja
seal thu it is that the london feather sale still list these among
the most splendid of all live bird and shame upon shame when we
read of 80 impeyan skin dull or slightli defect we know that
these ar femal bird then if ever we realiz that the time of the
bird and the beast is pass the acm of evolut for these wonder
be is reach and at most we can preserv onli a small fragment of
them
to the millineri hunter what the egret is to america and the bird of
paradis to new guinea the impeyan pheasant is to indiath most
covet of all plumag there is a great tendenc to blame the nativ
hunter for the decreas of thi and other pheasant and from what i
have person seen in mani part of the himalaya there is no question
that the garwhales and nepales hillmen have wrought havoc among the
bird but these men ar by no mean the sole caus as long ago as 1879
we read that the great demand for the brilliant skin of the moonal
that ha exist for mani year ha led to their almost total
extermin in some part of the hill as the nativ shikari shoot
and snare for the pot as well as for skin and kill as mani femal as
male on the other hand though for nearli thirti year my friend mr
wilson ha yearli sent home from 1000 to 1500 skin of thi speci
and the tragopan there ar still in the wood whenc thei were obtain
as mani as if not more than when he first enter them simpli becaus
he ha rigidli preserv femal and nest and as amongst english
pheasant on cock suffic for sever hen
illustr pheasant snare
made of yak hair taken from a shepherd in nepal by mr beeb
ignor the uncertainti of the last statement it is rather absurd to
think of a singl man preserv femal and nest in the himalaya
from 1850 to 1880 when the british govern despit most effici
law and worthi effort is unabl to protect the bird of these wild
region todai the statement that after thirti to fortyf thousand
cock impeyan were shot or snare as mani or more than the origin
quota remain could onli eman from the mind of a profession
featherhunt and hume should not be blame for more than the mere
repetit of such figur let it be said to the credit of wilson the
slaughter of someth near fortyf thousand impeyan that he wa
a care observ of the bird habit and ha given us an excel
account somewhat colour by nativ but on the whole the best we
have had in the past but it is not pleasant to read of hi wait
until twenti or thirti have got up and alight in the surround
tree and have then walk up to the differ tree and fire at those
i wish to procur without alarm the rest onli those veri close to
the on fire at be disturb at each report
hume opinion that in 1879 there were score of place where on might
secur from ten to eighteen bird in a dai is certainli not true
todai inde as earli as 1858 we read that thi splendid bird onc
so abund on the western himalaya is now far from be so in
consequ of the number kill by sportsmen on account of it beauti
whole tract of mountain forest onc frequent by the moonal ar now
almost without a singl specimen the same author goe on naiv to
tell the reader that among the most pleasant reminisc of bygon
dai is a period of eleven dai spent by the author and a friend on the
choor mountain near simia when among other trophi were number
sixtyeight moonal pheasant etc

on their wai to the london feather market photograph by mr beeb
for some unaccount reason there is or wa for mani year a veri
preval idea that the enorm number of skin which have pour into
the london market were from bird bred in the vicin of calcutta when
we rememb the intens heat of that lowli citi and learn from the
record of the calcutta zoolog garden that impeyan and tragopan
ar even shorterliv than in europ the absurd of the idea is
appar in spite of numberless inquiri throughout india i fail to
learn of a singl captiv young bird ever hatch and rear even in the
high cool hillstat the commerci valu of an impeyan skin ha
vari from five dollar to twenti dollar accord to the number
receiv annual in 1876 an estim place the monthli averag of
impeyan receiv in london at from two to eight hundr
in such a case as nepal direct protect law ar of no avail all
human argument ar useless but if the market at the other end can
be close the slaughter will ceas instantli and automat

as a contrast to the millineri hunter of fifti year ago it is
refresh to find that at last sincer effort ar be made in
british possess to stop thi traffic i happen to be at rangoon
when six larg bale of pheasant skin were seiz by the custom
offici a chinaman had brought them from yunnan via bhamo and wa
prepar to ship them as duck feather two of the bale were open
for my inspect the first contain about five hundr ladi amherst
pheasant skin fall to piec and lack head and leg the second
held over four hundr silver pheasant in almost perfect condit
the chief collector had put the absolut prohibit fine of 200
pound on them and wa wait for the expir of the legal number
of dai befor burn the entir lot thei must have repres year
of work in decim the pheasant fauna of western china
far up in the wilder of northern burma and over the yunnan border
we often came upon some of the most ingeni exampl of nativ
trap a system which we found repeat in the malai state borneo
china and other part of the far east a low bamboo fenc is built
directli across a steep vallei or seri of vallei about half wai from
the summit to the lower end and about everi fifteen feet a narrow
open is left over which a heavi log is suspend ani creatur
attempt to make it wai through tread upon sever small stick and
by so do spring the trap and the deadfal claim a victim when a
countri is systemat strung with trap such as these sooner or
later all but a piti remnant of the smaller mammal bird and
reptil ar certain to be wipe out morn after morn i have
visit such a runwai and found dead along it path what must have been
all the walk run or crawl creatur which the night befor
had sought the water at the bottom pheasant cobra moused
rodent civet and member of mani other group in some countri
noos instead of deadfal guard the open but the result is
equal deadli
i have describ thi method of trap becaus of it futur
import in the destruct of wild life in the far east the chinaman
in all hi mani million is undergo a remark swift and radic
evolut both of charact and dress in mani wai if onli from the
viewpoint of the patient thrifti storekeep he is a most power
factor in the east and is becom more so in mani case he imit
the white nation by cut off hi queue and alter hi dress in
some mysteri correl wai hi diet seem simultan affect
and while for untold gener rice and fish ha satisfi all hi
gastronom desir a new crave that for meat ha come to him the
result is appar in mani part of the east the chinaman is will
and abl to pai for meat and the nativ find a new market for the
creatur about him again and again when i wish a few specimen of
some certain pheasant i had but to hail pass cano and bid a few
anna or cash or ringit higher than the prospect chines
purchas would give and the pheasant were mine
in the catalogu of the broker sale of feather we read of mani
thousand of the wonder ocel wing feather of the argu
pheasant but no less horribl is the sight of a cano cram with the
bedraggl bodi of these magnific bird on their wai to some
chines hamlet where thei will be sold for a pittanc the flesh eaten
to the last tendon and the feather given to the children and puppi to
plai with the newlyar appetit of the mongolian will soon be an
import factor in the extermin of anim and bird few speci
be exempt for the chinaman live up to hi reput and is not
squeamish as to the natur of hi meat
befor we leav the subject of chinamen let us consid anoth recent
factor in the destruct of wild life which is at present wide
oper in china itself thi is the cold storag warehous of which
six or eight enorm on have gone up in differ part of the east
to speak in detail onli of the on at hankow six hundr mile up the
yangtz we found it to be the largest structur in the citi surround
by a high wall with each entranc and exit guard by arm sikh it
seem like the feudal castl of some mediev baron why such secreci
is necessari i could not learn as there ar no law against it
busi but so carefulli guard is it premis that until a short
time ago even the british consulgener of hankow had not been allow
to enter he howev at last refus to sign the paper for ani more
outgo shipment until he should be allow to see what wa go on
within the warehous i hope to be abl to look over some of the frozen
pheasant for interest scientif materi but of cours wa not
allow to do so
although here in the heart of china outsid chang ar not felt so
strongli and the newlyacquir meat diet of the border and emigr
chines is hardli appar these warehous have open up a new sourc
of revenu which ha met with instant respons thousand and ten of
thousand of wild shot or trap pheasant and other bird ar now
brought to these establish by the nativ from far and near the
bird ar frozen and twice a year ship on special refriger p
and o steamship to england and the contin of europ where thei seem
to find a readi sale pig and chicken also figur in the shipment
now the pheasant have for centuri exist in enorm number in the
endless ricefield of china without do ani damag to the crop in
fact thei could not be present in such number without be an
import factor in keep down insect and other enemi of the grain
when their number ar decim as thei ar be at present there
must eventu result a seriou upset of the balanc of natur let
us hope that in some wai thi mai be avoid and that the present
famin death of thirti thousand or more in some provinc will not be
increas mani fold
when i start on thi search for pheasant i wa repeatedli told by old
explor in the east that my task would be veri differ from their
of thirti year ago that i would find steamer railroad and
automobil where formerli were onli cano and jungl i inde found
thi as report but while my task wa differ it wa made no easier
formerli to be sure on had from the start to paddl slowli or push
along the trail made by nativ or game anim but then the wild life
wa encount at onc while i found it alwai far from the end of the
steamer rout or the railroad termin and still to be reach onli
by the most primit mode of travel
i cite thi to give point to my next great caus of destruct the
burn and clear of vast stretch of countri for the plant of
rubber tree the east seem rubber mad and whether the enorm output
which will result from the million of tree set out month after month
will be profit i cannot sai i can think onli of the vanish of
the entir fauna and flora of mani district which i have seen as a
direct result of thi commerci activ on leav port swettenham on
the west coast of selangor and for the hour run to kuala lumpur see
hardli anyth but vast radiat line of spindl rubber tree all
underbrush clear all nativ growth vanish from kuala lumpur to
kuala kubu at the veri foot of the mountain backbon of the malai
peninsula the same hold true and where some area appear not under
cultiv the climb fern and a coars useless lalang grass
cover everi inch of ground on can hardli imagin a more complet
blot out of the nativ fauna and flora of ani on limit region
and everextend road for the increas motor car ar widen the
clear zone mile after mile to the north and south
in thi region as we push on over the mountain into the wilder
of pahang we saw littl of the actual destruct of the primev
nativ growth but elsewher it becam a common sight onc for mani
dai we studi the wonder life of a jungl which stretch up to our
veri camp troop of rollick wawa or gibbon frequent the forest
squirrel tupaia bird and insect in myriad were everywher dure
the dai great fruitbat fly lemur owl and other nocturn
creatur made the even and night full of interest
and then on dai without warn came the sound of an ax and anoth
and anoth from that moment the song cri chirp and roar of the
jungl were seldom heard from our camp everi dai saw new phalanx of
splendid primev tree fallen or half suspend in their rig of
liana the leav wither the flower petal fell and we heard no more
the crackl of bamboo in the wind then the piti survivor of the
destruct were brought to us now a babi fly lemur flung from it
hole by the fall of some tree young tupaia nestl bird a few
out of the thousand of creatur from insect to mammal which were
slain so that a chinaman or malai might ek a few dollar four or five
year henc from a grove of rubber tree i do not sai it is wrong man
ha won out and might is right as sinc the dawn of creation but to
the onlook to the lover of natur and the anim world it is a
terribl a hopeless thing
on cannot at present leav the tourist line of travel in the east
without at onc encount evid of the wholesal direct slaughter
of wild life or it no less certain extermin by the elimin of
the haunt and the food plant of the variou beast and bird
chapter xxi
the savag viewpoint of the gunner
the mental attitud of the men who shoot constitut a deadli factor in
the destruct of wild life and the extermin of speci fulli
ninetyf per cent of the sportsmen gunner and other men and boi
who kill game all over the world and in all nation regard game bird
and mammal onli as thing to be kill and eaten and not as
creatur worth preserv for their beauti or their interest to
mankind thi is precis the viewpoint of the caveman and the savag
and it ha come down from the manwithaclub to the manwithagun
absolut unchang save for on thing the latter sometim is
prompt to save todai in order to slaughter tomorrow
the abov statement of an exist fact mai seem harsh and some person
mai be startl by it but it is base on an acquaint with thousand
of men who shoot all kind of game all over the world my critic
sure will admit that my opportun to meet the sportsmen and
gunner of the world ar and for thirtyf year have been rather
favor as a matter of fact i think the effort of the hunter of my
person acquaint have cover about sevententh of the hunt
ground of the world if the estim that i have form of the averag
hunter viewpoint is wrong or even partial so i will be glad to
have it proven in order that i mai reform my judgment and apolog
in work with larg bodi of birdshoot sportsmen i have
steadilyand also painfullybeen impress by their intent on
kill and by the fact that thei seek to preserv game onli to kill
it who ever saw a birdshoot rise in a convent and advoc the
preserv of ani speci of game bird on account of it beauti or it
esthet interest aliv i never did and i have sat in mani
convent of sportsmen all the talk is of open season bag limit
and kill right the man who ha the hardihood to stand up and
propos a fiveyear close season ha a hard row to hoe men rise and
sai it all nonsens there plenti of quail shoot on long island
yet
throughout the length and breadth of america the rule passion is to
kill as long as anyth killabl remain the man who will openli
advoc the stop of quailshoot becaus the quail ar of such
great valu to the farmer or becaus thei ar so beauti and
companion to man receiv no sympathi from nineti per cent of the
birdkil sportsmen the remain ten per cent think serious about
the matter and favor long close season it is my impress that of
the men who shoot it is onli among the biggam hunter that we find
much genuin admir for game anim or ani feel remot
resembl regard for it
the moment that a major of american gunner conced the fact that
game bird ar worth preserv for their beauti and their valu as
live neighbor to man from that moment there is hope for the save
of the remnant that will inde be the begin of a new era of a
millennium in fact in the preserv of wild life it will then be
easi to enact law for tenyear close season on whole group of
speci think what it would mean for such a close season to be enact
for all the grous of the unit state all the shorebird of the
unit state or the wild turkei wherev found
todai the greatinde the onlyoppon of long close season
on game bird ar the gunner whenev and wherev you introduc a
bill to provid such a season you will find that thi is true the gun
club and the downtrodden hunter and angler protect associ
will be quick to go after their repres and oppos the bill
and state senat and assemblymen will think veri hard and with strong
courag befor thei deliber resolv to do their duti regardless of
the opposit of a larg bodi of sportsmenmen who have vote and
who know how to take reveng on lawmak who depriv them of their
right to kill the greatest speech ever made in the mexican congress
wa utter by the member who solemnli said i rise to sacrific
ambit to honor
unfortun the men who shoot have becom possess of the idea that
thei have certain inher godgiven right to kill game now as a
matter of fact a sportsman with a onehundreddollar fox gun in hi
hand a twohundreddollar dog at hi heel and five onehundreddollar
bill in hi pocket ha no more right to kill a covei of quail on long
island than my milkman ha to elect that it shall be let alon for the
pleasur of hi children the time ha come when the peopl who dont
shoot must do on of two thing
1 thei must demonstr the fact that thei have right in the wild
creatur and demand their recognit or
2 see the killabl game all swept off the contin by the armi of
destruct
realli it is to me veri strang that gunner never care to save game
bird on account of their beauti on live bob white on a fenc is
better than a score in a bloodi gamebag a live squirrel in a tree is
poetri in motion but on the tabl a squirrel is a rodent that tast as
a rat smell besid the ocean a flock of sandpip is need to
complet the beauti pictur but on the tabl a sandpip is beneath
contempt a live deer trot over a green meadow wave a triangular
white flag is a sight to thrill ani human ganglion but a deer ly
deadunless it ha an exception fine headi onli so much
butcher meat
on of the finest sight i ever saw in montana wa a big flock of sage
grous slowli stalk over a grassi flat thinli sprinkl with
sagebrush it wa far more inspir than ani pile of dead bird that i
ever saw i rememb score of beauti game bird that i have seen and
not kill but of all the game bird that i have eaten or tri to eat
in new york i rememb with sincer pleasur onli on some of the
ancient coldstorag candid i rememb for caus as the lawyer
sai
illustr on morn catch of trout near spokan

sportsmen and gunner for god sake elev your viewpoint of the
game of the world get out of the groov in which man ha run ever sinc
the dai of adam there is someth in a game bird over and abov it
pound of flesh you dont need the meat ani longer for you dont know
what hunger is save by read of it try the fieldglass and the
camera instead of the everlast gun ani fool can take a fivedollar
gun and kill a bird but it take a geniu to photograph on wild bird
and get a good on as hunter the camera men have the best of it
on good livebird photograph is more of a trophi and a triumph than a
bushel of dead bird the bird and mammal now ar liter dy for
your help in the make of long close season and in the real
stoppag of slaughter can you not hear the call of the wild remnant
it is time for the peopl who dont shoot to call a halt on those who
do and if thi be treason then let my enemi make the most of it
sinc the abov wa written i have read in the outdoor world for
april 1912 the view of a veteran sportsman and writer mr emerson
hough on the wildlif situat as it seem to him todai it is a
strong utter even though it reach a pessimist and gloomi

the truth is none the less the truth becaus it is unpleas to
face there is no well post sportsman in america no manufactur
of sport good in america no man well vers in american outdoor
matter who doe not know that we ar at the even of the dai of
open sport in america our old wai have fail all of them have

america would prove that if proof were ask our sportsmanship ha
fail our game law have fail and we know thei have fail our
game is almost gone and we know it is almost gone america ha
chang and we know that it ha chang although we have not
chang with it the old america is done and it is gone and we know
that to be the truth the old order passeth and we know that the
new order must come soon if it is to work ani salvat for our wild
game and our life in the open in pursuit of it
there ar mani reason for thi fact these fact perhap the
greatest li in the steadi advanc of civil into the

anoth great agenc is the rapid perfect of transport all

if even africa will soon be overrun if even africa soon will be
shot out what hope is there for the game of the wholli access

it is all too easi now for the slaughter to get to hi work all
too easi for him to transport the fruit of the slaughter at the

in a wholli greedi unscrupul and selfish fashion thi ha been
our polici as a nation if there is to be success for ani plan to
remedi thi it must come from a few largemind men abl to think
and plan and abl to do more than thatto follow their plan with

i have seen the whole stori of modern american sportsmanship so
call it ha been class legisl and organ
selfishnessthat is what it ha been and noth els i do not
blame countri legisl game dealer farmer for call the
sportsmen of america selfish and thoughtless i do not blame them
for sai that the socal protect measur advanc by
sportsmen have been selfish measur and look to destruct
rather than to protect at least that ha been their actual
result i have no more rever for a sportsman than for anyon
els and no rever for him at all becaus he is or call himself
a sportsman he ha got to be a man he ha got to be a citizen
i have seen million of acr of breed and feed ground pass
under the drain and under the plow in my own time so that the
pass whisper of the wild fowl wing ha been forgotten there now
for mani year i have seen a half dozen speci of fine game bird
becom extinct in my own time and lost forev to the american
peopl
and you and i have seen on protect societi after anoth
languidli organ pai in a languid dollar or so per capita
each year and so swiftli pass also to be forgotten we have
seen on code and the other of conflict and wholli selfish game
law pass and seen them mock at and forgotten seen them all
fail as we all know
we have seen even the nation powerund that ark of the coven
known as the interst commerc actfail to stop wholli the
lessen of our wild game so rapidli disappear for so mani
reason
we have seen both selfish and unselfish sportsmen journal attempt
to solv thi problem and fail to do so some of them were great and
broadmind journal their record ha not been on of disgrac
although it ha been on of defeat for some of them realli desir
success more than thei desir dividend these all of them bore
their share of a great experi an experi in a new land
under a new theori of govern a theori which sai a man should
be abl to restrain himself and to govern himself onli by
follow their theori through to the end of that experi could
thei know that it wa to fail in on of it most vital interest
and vital import phase
but now as we know all of these agenc selfish or unselfish
have fail to effect the salvat of american wild game not by
ani scheme devic or theori not by ani panacea can the old dai
of america be brought back to us
mr hough view ar entitl to respect consider but on on
vital point i do not follow him
i believ most sincerelyin fact i knowthat it is possibl to
make a few new law which in addit to the mani mani good protect
law we alreadi have will bring back the game just as fast and as far
as man settlement town railroad mine and scheme in gener
ever can permit it to come back
if the american peopl as a whole elect that our wild life shall be
save and to a reason extent brought back then by the etern it
will be save and brought back the road li straight befor us and
the go is easyif the mass make up it mind to act but on on

illustr a food suppli of whitetail deer
the kill of the doe wa wrong
to meet the legitim demand for the abat of unbear
wildanim nuisanc i recommend the enact of a law similar to
section 158 of the game law of new york which provid for the safe
and legitim abat of unbear wild creatur as follow
section 158 power to take bird and quadrup in the event that
ani speci of bird protect by the provis of section two
hundr and nineteen of thi articl or quadrup protect by
law shall at ani time in ani local becom destruct of
privat or public properti the commiss shall have power in it
discret to direct ani game protector or issu a permit to ani
citizen of the state to take such speci of bird or quadrup
and dispos of the same in such manner as the commiss mai
provid such permit shall expir within four month after the date
of issuanc
thi measur should be adopt by everi state that is troubl by too

i desir to point out that between bangor and san diego and from kei
west to bellingham our countri contain million of acr of wild
practic uninhabit forest rough foothil badland and
mountain that could produc two million deer each year without
deduct 50000 a year from the wealth of the countri i grant that in
the total number of deer that would be necessari to produc two million
deer per annum the farm situat on the edg of forest and actual
within the forest would suffer somewhat from the depred of those
deer as i will present show by documentari record everi on of
those individu damag that exce two dollar in valu could be
compens in cash and afterward leav on the credit side of the deer
account an enorm annual balanc
stop for a moment you enterpris and restless men and women who
travel all over the unit state and think of the illimit mile of
unbroken forest that you have look upon from your pullman window in
the east in the south in the west and in southern canada recal the
wood mountain of the appalachian system the white mountain region
the pine forest of the atlant coast and the gulf state the forest
of tennesse arkansa and southern missouri of northern minnesota and
everi state of the rocki mountain region then think of the silent and
untouch forest of the pacif coast and tell me whether you think
five million deer scatter through all those forest would make ani
visibl impress upon them that would be onli about twentyf time
as mani as ar there now i think the forest would not be over
popul and thei would produc two million killabl deer each year
last year 11000 deer were forc down out of their hide place in
the rocki mountain and were kill in montana even the nativ had
not dream there were so mani avail and thei were slaughter not
wise but too ill it is not right that six member of on famili
should hog twelv deer in on season at present no deer suppli can
stand such slaughter
assum that the peopl of the unit state could be educ into
the idea of so conserv deer that thei could draw two million head per
year from the gener stock what would it be worth
it is not veri difficult to estim the valu of a deer when the whole
anim can be util in variou portion of the unit state deer
vari in size but i shall take all thi into account and try to strike
a fair averag in some section where deer ar larg and heavi a
fullgrown buck is easili worth twentyf dollar let him who doubt
it try to replac those gener pound of flesh with purchas beef
and mutton and veal and see how far twentyf dollar will go toward
it everi man who is a household know full well how littl meat on
dollar will bui at thi time
i think that throughout the unit state as a whole everi fullgrown
deer male or femal contain on an averag ten dollar worth of good
meat i know of on larg preserv which annual sell it surplu of
deer at that price wholesal to dealer and in new york citi
doubtless in mani other citi also venison often ha sold in the
market at on dollar per pound
two million deer at 10 each mean 20000000 the licens for the
kill of two million deer should cost on million men on dollar each
and that would pai 1666 new game warden each fifti dollar per month
all the year round the damag that would need to be paid to farmer
on account of crop injur by deer would be so small that each counti
could take care of it own case from it own treasuri as is done in
the state of vermont
there ar certain essenti to the realiz of a dream of two
million deer per year that ar absolut requir thei ar neither
obscur nor imposs
each state and each counti propos to stock it vacant wood with deer
must resolut educ it own peopl in the necess of plai fair
about the kill of deer and give everi man and everi deer a squar
deal thi is not imposs not as a gener thing even though it
mai be so in some special lawless commun if the lead men of
the state and the counti will take thi matter serious in hand it can
be done in two year time the american peopl ar not insens to
appeal to reason when those appeal ar made by their own home
folk the governor senat assemblymen judg mayor and
justic of the peac could if thei would make a campaign of
educ and appeal that would result in the creation of an immens
volum of free wild food in everi state that possess wild land
when the shoe of necess pinch the peopl hard enough rememb the
possibl in deer
illustr whitetail deer
if honestli and intellig conserv thi speci could be made to
produc on our wild land two million deer per annum as a new food suppli
from the american natur histori
the best wild anim to furnish a seriou food suppli is the
whitetail deer thi is becaus of it persist and fertil the
elk is too larg for gener us an elk carcass can not be carri on a
hors it is imposs to get a sled or a wagon to where it li and
so fulli half of it usual is wast the mule deer is good for the
rocki mountain and can live where the whitetail can not but it is
too easi to shoot the columbian blacktail is the natur speci for
the forest of the pacif state but it is a trifl small in size
the exampl of vermontin order to show that all the abov is not
base on empti theoryregard the stock of forest with deer
their wonder power of increas and the practic handl of the
damag questionlet us take the experi and the fine exampl of
vermont
in april 1875 a few sportsmen of rutland of whom the late henri w
chenei wa on procur in the adirondack thirteen whitetail deer
six buck and seven doe these were liber in a forest six mile
from rutland and beyond be protect from slaughter thei were left
to shift for themselv thei increas slowli at first then rapidli
and by 1897 thei had becom so numer that it seem right to have a
short annual open season and kill a few from first to last mani of
those deer have been kill contrari to law in 19045 it wa known
that 294 head were destroi in that wai and undoubtedli there were
other that were not report

damag to crop by deerfor sever year past the variou counti
of vermont have been pai farmer for damag inflict upon their
crop by deer clearli it is more just that counti should settl
these damag than that thei should be paid from the state treasuri
becaus the counti pai damag have larg compens in the valu
of the deer kill each year the hunt appear to be open to all
person who hold licens from the state
in order that the public at larg mai know the cost of the vermont
system i offer the follow digest compil from the last biennial
report of the state fish and game commission
damag paid for deer depred in vermont dure

valu of whitetail deerhav note the fact that in two year
19089 the peopl of vermont paid out 4865 in compens for
damag inflict by deer it is of interest to determin whether that
monei wa wise expend in other word did it pai
we have seen that in the year 1908 and 9 the peopl of vermont kill
legal and illeg and convert to us 7186 deer thi doe not
includ the deer kill by dog and by accid
regard the valu of a fullgrown deer it must be rememb that
much depend upon the local of the carcass in new york or pittsburg
or chicago a whole deer is worth at wholesal at least twentyf
dollar in vermont where deer ar plenti thei ar worth a less
sum i think that fifteen dollar would be a fair figureat least low
enough
even when comput at fifteen dollar per carcass those deer were worth
to the peopl of vermont 107790 it would seem therefor that the
sound of vermont polici leav no room for argument and we hope
that other state and also privat individu will profit by
vermont veri success experi in bring back the deer to her
forest and in increas the food suppli of her peopl
kill femal deerto sai on word on thi subject which might by ani
possibl be constru as favor it is like juggl with a light
torch over a barrel of gunpowd alreadi in pennsylvania at least on
gentleman ha appear anxiou to repres me as favor the kill
of doe which in nine hundr and ninetynin case out of everi
thousand i distinctli and emphat do not the slaughter of femal
hoof game anim is necessarili destruct and reprehens and
not on man out of everi ten thousand in thi countri ever will see the
place and time wherein the opposit is true
at present there ar just two place in america and i think onli two
wherein there exist the slightest except on thi point the state of
vermont is becom overstock with deer and the femal have in
some counti not in all becom so tame and destruct in
orchard garden and farm crop as to constitut a great annoy for
thi reason the experi is be made of permit doe to be
kill under licens until their number is somewhat reduc
the first return from thi trial have now come in from the counti game
warden of vermont to the state game warden mr john w titcomb i will
quot the gist of the opinion of each
the state commission sai thi law should remain in forc at least
until there is some indic of a decreas in the number of deer
warden wh taft addison counti sai the kill of doe i believ
did awai with a good mani of these tame deer that caus most of the
damag to farmer crop harri chase bennington counti sai the
doekil law is a good law and i sincer trust it will not be
repeal warden hayward of rutland counti sai the major of the
farmer in thi counti ar in favor of repeal the doe law a great
mani doe and young deer almost fawn were kill in thi counti
dure the hunt season of 1909 rw wheeler of rutland counti
sai have the doe law repeal we dont need it hj parcher of
washington counti find that the doe did more damag to the crop than
the buck and he think the doe law is a just on rl frost of
windham counti judici conclud that the law allow doe to be
kill should remain in forc on or two season more cs parker of
orlean counti sai hi counti is not overstock with deer and he
favor a special act for hi counti to protect femal
a summari of the testimoni of the warden is easili made when deer ar
too plenti and the overtam doe becom a public nuisanc too great
to be endur the number should be reduc by regular shoot in the
open season but
as soon as the proper balanc of deer life ha been restor protect
the doe onc more
the pursuit of thi polici is safe and sane provid it can be wrought
out without the influenc of selfish and reckless disregard for the
right of the next gener on the whole it handl is like
plai with fire and i think there ar veri veri few state on thi
earth wherein it would be wise or safe to try it as a wise friend onc
remark to me give some men a hinch and theyll alwai try to take a
hell in vermont howev the situat is kept so well in hand we mai
be sure that at the right moment the law provid for the decreas of
the number of doe will be repeal
hippopotami and antelopeslast year a bill wa introduc in the lower
hous of congress propos to provid fund for the introduct into
certain southern state of variou anim from africa especi
hippopotami and african antelop the former were propos partli for
the purpos of rid navig of the water hyacinth that now ar
choke mani of the stream of louisiana and mississippi the antelop
were to be acclimat as a food suppli for the peopl at larg
thi measur well illustr the prevail disposit of the american
peopl todayto ignor and destroi their own valuabl natur stock
of wild bird and mammal and when thei have complet their war of
extermin reach out to foreign countri for foreign speci
instead of preserv the deer of the south the south reach out for
the utterli imposs antelop of africa and the preposter
hippopotamu the north joyous extermin her quail and ruf
grous and goe to europ for the hungarian partridg that partridg
is a failur here and i am heartili glad of it on the ground that
the extermin of our nativ speci do not deserv success in their
effort to displac our finest nativ speci with other from abroad
the hippoantelop proposit is a climax of absurd in propos
the replac of valuabl nativ game with imposs foreign speci
chapter xxv
law and sentiment as factor in preserv
there is grave danger that through ignor of the true charact of
about 80 per cent of the men and boi who shoot wild creatur a great
wrong will be done the latter let us not make a fatal mistak
after more than thirti year of observ among all kind of
sportsmen hunter and gunner i am convinc that it is utterli futil
and deadli danger to reli on human highclass sentiment to diminish
the slaughter of wild thing by gamehog and pothunt
in some respect the term gamehog is a rude rough word but it is
need in the english languag and it ha come to stai it is a
disagre term but it wa brought into us to appli to a class of
veri disagre person
a gamehog is a hunter of game who know no such thing as sentiment or
conscienc in the kill of game so long as he keep within the limit
of the law regardless of the scarciti of game or of it hard struggl
for exist he will kill right up to the bag limit everi dai that he
goe out provid it is possibl to do so he us the law as a salv
for the spot where hi conscienc should be he will shoot with ani
machin gun or gun of big calibr in everi wai that the law allow
and he know no such thing as give the game a squar deal he brag of
hi big bag of game and he love to be photograph with a wagonload
of dead bird as a background he believ in automat and pump gun
spring shoot longer open season and more game he is quit
content to shoot half tame duck in a club preserv as thei fly between
coop and pond whenev he secur an opportun he will gladli sell
hi game whenev he can do so without be found out and sometim
when he is
often a true sportsman drift without realiz it into some on wai of
the confirm gamehog but the moment he is made to realiz hi
posit he chang hi cours and hi stand the gamehog is
impervi to argument you can shame a hors awai from hi oat more
easili than you can shame him from do what the law allow
there ar hundr of thousand of gentlemen and gentlewomen who never
onc have come in touch with real clovenfoot gamehog who do not
understand the speci at all and do not recogn it earmark
thousand of such person will tell you in my opinion the best wai to
save the wild life is to educ the peopl i have heard that mani
mani time
for rightheart peopl a littl law is quit suffici and the best
peopl need none at all but the gamehog ar differ for them the
strict letter of the law back up by a strongarm squad is the onli
control influenc that thei recogn to them it is necessari to
sai you shall and you shall not
onli yesterdai the latest gamehog case wa relat to me by a
gameprotector from kansa into a certain counti of southern kansa
from which the prairiechicken had been total gone for a dozen year
or more a pair of those bird enter settl down and nest their
come wa to mani habit a joyou event now said the peopl we
will care for these bird and thei will multipli and present the
counti will be restock
but ahab came two men from anoth counti call themselv sportsmen
but not entitl to that name heard of those bird and resolv to
get them thei wait until the young were just leav the nest and
thei went down and camp near by on the first dai thei kill the two
parent bird and half the flock of young bird and the next dai thei
got all the rest
but there is a sequel to thi stori on of those men wa a dealer in
gun and ammunit and when hi custom heard what he had done
thei simpli put him out of busi by refus to trade with him ani
more he is now wash dirti dish in a restaur but at heart he
is a gamehog just the same
near bridgeport connecticut a gentleman of my acquaint own a fine
estat which is adorn with a trout stream and a superfin trout pond
onc he invit a busi man of bridgeport to be hi guest and fish
for trout in hi pond on that guest dure a visit of three dai all
the finest form of hospit were bestow
two week later my friend gamewarden caught that guest earli on a
sundai morn poach on the troutpond and spoil hi carefulli

in hi book saddl and camp in the rocki mr dillon wallac tell a
stori of a man from new york who in the mountain of colorado
deliber corrupt hi guid with monei or other influenc shot
mountain sheep in midsumm and got awai with it
in northern minnesota georg e wood ha been have a handtohand
fight with the worst commun of gamehog and alienborn poacher of
which i have heard there appear to be no game law that thei do not
systemat violat the killer seem determin to annihil the
last head of game in spite of fine and imprison the foreign
ar absolut uncontrol the latest featur of the war is the
discoveri of a tanneri in the wood where the hide of
illegallyslaught deer and moos ar dress appar the onli
kind of a law that will save the game of northern minnesota is on that
will total disarm the entir popul
in pennsylvania there exist an associ which wa form for the
express purpos of fight the state game commiss prevent the
enact of a hunter licens law and repeal the law against the
kill of femal deer and hornless fawn the continu exist of
that organ on that basi would be a stand disgrac to the fair
name of pennsylvania i think howev that that organ wa
found on secret selfish purpos and that er long the gener bodi
of member will awaken to a realiz sens of their posit and rang
themselv in support of the excel polici of the commiss
a pothunt is a man or boi who kill game as a busi for the monei
that can be deriv from it sale or other us such men have the same
feel as butcher from their point of view thei can see no reason
why all the game in the world should not be kill and market like
the featherdeal thei wish to get out of the wild life all the monei
there is in it that is all left to themselv with open market thei
would soon extermin the land fauna of the habit portion of the
globe
no on can educ such peopl for the gunner gamehog and
pothunt there is no check save specif law that sternli and
ampli safeguard the right of the wild creatur that can not make law
for themselv
nor can anyon educ the heartless woman of fashion who is determin
to wear aigrett as long as her monei can bui them the best women of
the world have alreadi been educ on the birdmillineri subject
and thei ar alreadi against the us of the gaudi badg of slaughter
and extermin but in the great citi of the world there ar
thousand of women who ar at heart as cruel as salom herself and
whose viciou tast can be curb onli by the strong hand of the law
sentiment for wild bird is not in them
becaus of the viciou and heartless element among men and women we
sai give us farreach ironbound law for the protect of wild
life and plenti of courag men to enforc them

the armi of the defens
it now seem that the friend of wild life who themselv ar not on the

armi of the defens and it strength and weak it is an interest
subject but the limit of space will not permit an extend
treatment
over the world at larg i think the activ destroy outnumb the
activ defend of wild life at least in the ratio of 500 to 1 and the
monei avail to the destroy is to the fund of the defend as
500 is to 1 the averag biggam sportsman cheerfulli expend from
500 to 1000 on a hunt trip but resent the suggest that he
should subscrib from 50 to 100 for wild life preserv if he put
down 10 he think he ha done a big thing wors than thi i am
forc to believ that at least 75 per cent of the biggam sportsmen of
the world never have contribut on dollar in monei or on hour of
effort to that caus but there ar except and i can name at least
fifti sportsmen who have subscrib 100 each to campaign fund and
some who have given as high as 1000
onc i sat down besid a financi rich slaughter of game and ask
him to subscrib a sum of real monei in behalf of a veri import
campaign i need fund veri much and i explain exhort and
besought i point out hi dutyto give back someth in return for

how to make a new game law
the line of actionin the face of a calam the save of life and
properti and the check of fire and flood depend upon good judgment and
quick action at the critic moment in emerg the slow and
academ method will not serv it is the run the jump the short cut
and the violent method that save life if a woman is drown the
sensibl man doe not wait for an introduct to her nor doe he run
to an acquaint to borrow hi boat or stop to put on a collar and
neckti he seiz the first boat that he can find and break it lock
and chain if necessari or fail that he plung in without on
when he reach the imperil parti he doesnt sai will you kindli
let me save you he seiz her by the hair and tri to keep her head
abov water without ceremoni
that is todai the condit and the treatment necessari regard our
remnant of wild life we ar compel to act quickli directli and
even violent at time if we save anyth worth while
there is no time to depend upon the academ educ of the public
by the seduct illustr lectur on bird or the articl about the
habit of mammal those method ar all well enough in their place
but we must not depend upon them in emerg like the present for
thei do not pass law or arrest lawbreak give the public all of that
materi that you can suppli and the more the better but for heaven
sake do not depend upon the spread of birdlor educ to stop
the work of the gamehog if you do all the wild life will be
destroi while the educ work is go on
often you can educ a gunner and make him a protectionist but you
never can do it by show him pictur of bird he need strong
reason and exhort not birdlor todai it is necessari to
emploi the most direct forc and at time even rude method where
slaughter cannot be stop by moral suasion it must be stop with
a hickori club the thing to do is to get result and get them
quickli befor it is too late
if the busi section of a town is burn down no on goe into the
suburb to lectur on architectur or exhibit pictur of fire
apparatu the rush is for water fireengin redblood men and
dynamit when the bird all around you ar be shot to death by
poacher who fear not god nor regard man and you need help to stop it
on the instant run to your neighbor hous and ring hi bell if he
fail to hear the bell pound on hi door until you jar the whole hous
when he come down halfdress blink and rub hi ey shout
at him
come out your bird ar all be shot to piec
ar thei he will sai but what can i do about it i cant help it
im no game warden
put on your cloth get your shotgun and come out and drive off the
kill gang
but what good will that do thei will come back again
not if we do our duti we must have them arrest and appear against
them in court
but sai the sleepi citizen that wont do much good the law ar
not strict enough and besid thei ar not well enforc even as thei
ar
then let make it our busi to see that the present law ar
enforc and go to our member of the legislatur and have them pass
some stronger law
and thi bring me to a veri import subject
how to pass a new law
we ventur to sai that the averag citizen littl realiz how possibl
it is to secur the passag of a law that is clearli necessari for the
better protect of wild life and forest becaus of thi and of the
necess for exact knowledg i shall here set down specif
instruct on thi subject
the person equationon determin man can secur the passag of a
good law provid he is reason intellig and suffici
determin the man who start a movement must make up hi mind to
follow it up direct it fortun stai with it when the storm of
opposit beat upon it and never give up until it is sign by the
governor he must be will to sacrific hi person conveni mani
of hi pleasur and work when hi friend ar asleep or pleasur
in work for the protect of wild life there is on mighti and
unfail sourc of consol it is thi
your caus alwai gain in strength and the caus of the destroy
alwai lose strength
the choic of a causeb broadmind do not rush to the legislatur
with a demand for a law to permit the take of bullhead with
junebug in the creek of your township or to give your counti a
special earli open season on quail in order that your boi mai try hi
new gun befor he goe back to colleg dont propos ani local
legisl for in progress state local game legisl is
come strongli into disfavorjust as it should legisl for your
whole state and noth less
do not bother your legislatur with a trivial bill choos a caus that
is worth while to grown men and it shall be well with you it take no
more time to pass a larg bill than a small on and big men prefer to
be identifi with big measur
befor you have a bill drawn advis with men whose opinion ar worth
have if the end you have in mind is a great and good on go ahead
whether you secur support in advanc or not if the need of the hour
clearli demand the measur go ahead even though you start absolut
alon a good measur never goe far without attract compani
draft a billa a rule the member of a legisl bodi do not
have time to draft bill on subject that ar new or strang to them a
short bill is easili prepar by your own repres but a lengthi
bill cover a seriou reform is a differ matter hire a lawyer to
draft the bill for you a realli good lawyer will not charg much for
draft a bill that is to benefit the public and grind no privat ax
but if the bill is long and requir long studi even the good citizen
must charg someth
your bill must fulli recogn exist law it must be either
prohibitori or permiss which mean that it can sai what shall not be
done or els that which mai be done accord to law all other act
be forbidden your lawyer must decid which form is best for my
part i greatli prefer the prohibit form as be the stronger and
more impress of the two i think it is the provinc of the law to
forbid the destruct of wild life and forest under penalti
penaltieseveri law should provid a penalti for it infring but
the penalti should not be out of all proport to the offens it is
just as unwis to impos a fine of on dollar for kill songbird for
food as it is to provid for a fine of three hundr dollar a fine
that is too small fail to impress the prison and it beget contempt
for the law and the court a fine that is altogeth too high is apt to
be set asid by the court as excess in my opinion the best fine
for wild life slaughter would be as follow
shoot net or trap songbird and other nongam
bird each bird 5 to 25
kill game bird out of season each bird 10 to 50
sell game contrari to law each offens 100 to 200
dynamit fish 100 to 200
sein or net game fish 50 to 200
shoot bird with unfair weapon 10 to 100
kill an egret carolina parakeet or whoop crane 100 to 200
kill a mountain sheep or antelop anywher in the us 500
kill an elk contrari to law 50
kill a femal deer or fawn without horn each offens 50
trap a grizzli bear for it skin 100
for kill a man by mistak the fine should be 500 payabl in five
annual instal to the court for the famili of the victim
whenev fine ar not paid the convict parti should be sentenc to
imprison at hard labor at the rate of onehalf dai for each dollar
of the fine impos and a sentenc at hard labor should be the first
option of the court mani a rich and reckless poacher snap hi finger
at fine but a sentenc to hard labor would strike terror to the heart
of the most brazen of them to all such men labor is the twin terror
to death

chapter xxviii
new law need a rollcal of the state
the principl of wildlif protect and encourag ar now so
firmli establish as to leav littl room for argument regard their
valu when thei ar set forth befor the peopl of ani given state the
onli question is of willing to do the right thing of duti or a
defianc of duti of good citizenship or the reign of selfish men
who do not wish to do their duti purpos befog great issu by noisi
talk and tiresom academ discuss of trivial detail and such men
ar the curs and scourg of reform movement
there ar a veri few person who foolishli assert that there ar too
mani game law it is entir wrong for ani person to make such a
statement for it tend to promot harm error the fact that our law
ar too lenient or ar not fulli enforc is no excus for
denounc their purpos we have all along been too timid too self
indulg and too much afraid of hurt the feel of the gamehog
give me the power to make the game law of ani state or provinc and i
will guarante to save the nonmigratori wild life of that region i
will not onli make adequ law but i will also provid mean men and
penalti by which thei will be enforc it is easi and simpl for
men who ar not afraid
i have been at consider pain to analyz the game law of each
state ascertain their shortcom and give a list of the fault that
need correct by new legisl it ha requir no profound wisdom
to do thi becaus the principl involv ar so plain that ani
intellig schoolboi fifteen year old can master them in on hour i
have perform thi task hopefulli in the belief that in mani state
the real issu have not been plainli put befor the peopl hereaft
no state shall destroi it wild life through ignor of the law that
would preserv it
let no man sai that it is too late to save the wild life for
except the deadandgon speci that is not true let no man sai
that we can not save the wild life by law for that is not true
either as long as law ar lax even lawabid peopl will take
advantag of them
there ar million of men who think it is right to kill all the game
that the law allow there ar thousand of women who think it is right
to wear aigrett as long as the law permit their sale and yet if we
ar resolut and dilig there is plenti of hope for the futur dure
the past three year to go no farther back we have seen the whole
state of new york swept clean of the traffic in nativ wild game by the
bayn law and of the traffic in wild bird plumag on women hat
through the dutcher law todai in thi state we find ninetynin
women out of everi on hundr wear flower and lace and plush and
satin on their hat instead of the head bodi and feather of wild
bird that were the regular thing until three year ago the chang ha
been a power commentari on the valu of good law for the protect
of wild life the dutcher law ha caus the plumag of wild bird
almost wholli to disappear from the state of new york
we shall here point out the plain duti of each state and then it will
be up to them individu to decid whether thei can stand the
bloodtest or not
a state or a nation can be ungentlemanli unfair or mean just the same
as an individu no state ha a right to maintain shambl for the
slaughter of migratori game or song bird that belong in part to sister
state everi state hold it migratori bird life in trust for the
benefit of the peopl of the nation at larg a state is just as
respons for it treatment of wild life as ani individu and it is
time to open book of account
it is robberi as well as murder for ani southern state to slaughter
the robin of the northern state where no robin mai be kill no
southern gentleman can permit such do after the crime ha been
point out to him in the north the men who ar caught shoot
robin ar instantli hale to court and fine or imprison if we of
the north should kill for food the mockingbird that visit us the
peopl of the south instantli would brand us as monster of greed and
mean and thei would be perfectli justifi in so do
let us at least be honest in agre upon a state of fact as the
lawyer sai whether we act sensibl and mercifulli or not just so long
as there remain in thi land of our a fauna of game bird and the
gunner of onehalf the state ar allow to dictat the law for the
slaughter of it just so long will our present protect remain utterli
absurd and crimin inadequ look at these absurd
new york new jersei and mani other northern state rigidli prohibit the
late winter and spring shoot of waterfowl and shore bird and limit
the bag north carolina south carolina florida and other southern
state not onli slaughter wild fowl and shore bird all winter and
spring without limit but sever of them kill certain nongam bird
besid
all the northern state protect the robin for the good that it doe
but in north carolina tennesse mississippi louisiana and some other
southern state thousand of robin ar shot for food minnesota ha
stop spring shoot but her sister state on the south iowa
obstin refus to do so
the unit state at largether ar two great measur that should be
carri into effect by the govern bodi of the unit state on is
the enact of a law provid feder protect for all migratori
bird and canada and mexico should be induc to join with the unit
state in an intern treati to that effect
the other necessari measur is the passag of a joint resolut of
congress declar everi nation forest and forest reserv also a game
preserv and gener sanctuari for wild life in which there shall be
no hunt or kill of wild creatur of ani kind save predatori
anim
the tendenc of the timesand the univers slaughter of wild life on
thi continentpoint straight as an arrow fli in that direct
soon or late we have got to come to it if congress doe not take the
initiatori step the peopl will such a consumm is necessari
it is justifi by common sens and the inexor logic of the
situat and when done it will be right
the time wa when the friend of wild life did not dare speak of thi
subject in washington save in whisper that wa in the dai when the
appalachian park bill could not be pass and when there were angri
mutter and even curs level against gifford pinchot and the
forestri bureau becaus so mani nation forest were be set asid
that wa in the dai when a few western sheepmen thought that thei
own the whole rocki mountain without have bought them todai the
american peopl have grown accustom to the idea of have the
resourc of the public domain save and conserv for the benefit of
the million rather than lavish upon a favor few todai it is
perfectli safe to talk about make everi nation forest a first class
wildlif sanctuari and it is up to the peopl to request congress to
take that action at onc
the week bill the anthoni bill and the mclean bill now befor
congress to provid feder protect for migratori bird ar
practic ident all three ar good bill and it matter not
which on final becom a law whichev is put forward final for
passag should provid feder protect for all migratori bird that
ever enter the unit state alaska or porto rico why favor the duck
and leav the robin to it fate or vice versa it will be just as easi
to do thi task by whole as by halv the time to hesit to feel
timid or to be afraid of the other fellow ha gone by todai the
million of honest and seriousmind american ar readi to back the
most thorough and most drastic polici becaus that ha becom the most
necessari and the best polici furthermor it is the onli polici worthi
of seriou consider
some of our state have done rather well in wildlif
protectionconsid the absurd of our nation polici as a
whole other have done indiffer and some have been and still ar
veri remiss here is where we intend to hew to the line and without
fear or favor set forth the stand of each state accord to it
merit or it lack of merit in a lifeordeath matter such as now
confront us regard the wild life of our countri it is time to speak
plainli
in the follow call of the state the glare defici in state
game law will be set forth in detail in order that the sore spot mai
be expos to the view of the doctor condit will be repres
as thei exist at the end of the summer of 1912 and it is to be hope
that these fault soon mai be correct
a rollcal of the state
alabama
it is a satisfact to be abl to open thi list with the name of a
state that is entitl to a medal of honor for game protect in thi
particular field of progress and enlighten the state of alabama is
the pioneer state of the south new york now occupi a similar posit
in the north but new york is an older state and stronger in her
gener love of natur the attain of advanc protect in ani
southern state is a veri differ matter from what it is in the north
five year ago alabama set her hous in order the slaughter of song and
insectivor bird ha been so far stop as ani southern state can
stop it unaid by the feder govern and those bird ar
recogn and treat as the farmer best friend the absurd system
of attempt protect through counti law ha been abandon the sale
of game ha been stop and sinc that stoppag quail have increas
the trap and export of game have ceas and wild turkei and
woodcock ar now increas it is unlaw to kill or captur nongam
bird bag limit have been impos but the bag limit law ar all too
liber and should be reduc a hunter licens law is in forc and
the depart of game and fish is selfsupport night hunt is
prohibit and femal deer mai not be kill a comprehens warden
system ha been provid as yet howev alabama
permit the shoot of waterfowl to march 15 which is too late by
on and onehalf month
the us of automat and pump gun in hunt should be suppress
there should be a limit of two deer per year and kill should be
restrict to deer with horn not less than three inch long
the stori of game protect in alabama began in 1907 prior to that
time the slaughter of wild life wa veri great it is known that
enorm number of quail were annual kill by negro farm hand who
hunt at least three dai each week regardless of work to be done the
slaughter of quail wild duck woodcock dove robin and snipe wa
describ as nauseat
the chang that ha been wrought sinc 1907 is chiefli due to the
effort of on man alabama ow her stand todai to the admir
qualiti of john h wallac jr her game and fish commission
author of the state polici in wildlif conserv hi
broadminded hi judgment and hi success make him a live object
lesson of the power of on determin man in the conserv of wild
life
commission wallac is an ardent support of the week and anthoni
bill for feder protect and as a lawyer of the south he believ
there is no constitut inhibit against feder legisl for
the protect of bird of passag
alaska
the sale of game must be absolut prohibit forev
the slaughter of big game by indian miner and prospector should
now be limit and strictli regul by law on ration line
the slaughter of walru for ivori and hide both in the alaskan and
russian water of bere sea should be total prohibit for ten
year
the gamewarden servic should be quadrupl in number of warden
and in gener effect
the gamewarden servic should be suppli with two seago
vessel independ for patrol work
the bag limit on hoof game is 50 per cent too larg
to accomplish these end congress should annual appropri
50000 for the protect of wild life in alaska the present
amount 15000 is veri inadequ and the great wildlif
interest at stake ampli justifi the larger amount
it is now time for alaska to make substanti advanc in the protect
of her wild life it is no longer right nor just for indian miner and
prospector to be permit by law to kill all the big game thei pleas
whenev thei pleas the indol and often extortion indian of
alaskawho now demand big monei for everi servic thei performar
not so valuabl as citizen that thei should be permit to feed
riotous upon moos and cow moos at that until that speci is
extermin miner and prospector ar valuabl citizen but that is
no reason why thei should forev be allow to live upon wild game ani
more than that hungri prospector in our rocki mountain should be
allow to kill cattl
alaska and it resourc do not belong to the veri few peopl from the
state who have gone there to make their fortun and get out again as
quickli as possibl the quicker the public mind north of wrangel is
disabus of that idea the better it game belong to the peopl of
thi nation of ninetyodd million and it is a safe predict that the
nineti million will not continu to be will that the miner
prospector and indian shall continu to live on moos meat and carib
tongu in order to save bacon and beef
mr frank e kleinschmidt said to me that at sand point alaska he saw
eightytwo carib tongu brought in by an indian and sold at fifti
cent each while accord to all account most of the bodi of the
slaughter anim becam a loss
governor clark ha recommend in hi annual report for 1911 that the
protect now enjoi by the giant brown bear ursu middendorffi on
kadiak island be remov for the benefit of settler and their stock
it goe without sai that no on propos that predatori wild anim
shall be permit to retard the develop of ani wild countri that is
requir by civil man all we ask in thi matter is that as in the
case of the oncepropos slaughter of sealion on the pacif coast
the necess of the propos slaughter shall be fulli and adequ
proven befor the kill begin it is fair to insist that the
sealion episod shall not be repeat on kadiak island
the big game of alaska can not long endur against a limit of two
moos three mountain sheep three carib and six deer per year per
man at that rate the moos and sheep soon will disappear the limit
should be on moos two sheep two carib and four deerunless we
ar will to dedic the alaskan big game to commerci no
sportsman need a larger bag than the revis schedul and
commercialist should not be allow to kill big game anywher at ani
time
let us bear in mind the fact that alaska is be throughli open up
to the man with a gun here is the latest evid from the new
circular of an outfitt
i will have plenti of good hors and good compet and courteou
guid also other camp attend if desir my intent is to
establish perman at that point as i believ it is the gatewai to
the finest and about the last of the great game countri of north
america
the road is open the packtrain is readi the guid ar wait go on

awak arkansa consid the peril that threaten your fauna the sunk

colorado
the state of colorado should instantli stop the sale of nativ wild
game to be us as food
it should stop all late winter and spring shoot of nativ wild
bird
it should give the sage grous pinnat grous and all shore bird
a ten year close season remov the dove from the list of game
bird and give it a perman close season
it should remov the crane and the swan from the list of game bird
in twentyf short year we have seen in colorado a wast of wild life
and the destruct of a live inherit that ha few parallel in
histori possibl the peopl of colorado ar satisfi with the
residuum but some outsid regard all rocki mountain shambl with a
feel of horror
a brief quartercenturi ago colorado wa a zoolog park of grand
sceneri and big game the sceneri remain but of the great wild herd
onli sampl ar left and of some speci not even that
the last bison of colorado were extermin in lost park by scoundrel
call themselv taxidermist in 1897 of the 200000 mule deer
that inhabit routt counti and other portion of colorado not enough
now remain to make deer hunt interest a perpetu close season
wa put on mountain sheep just in time to save a dozen small flock as
seed stock those flock have been permit to live and thei have bred
until now there ar perhap 3500 sheep in the state of elk onli a
remnant is left now protect for fifteen year
the grizzli bear is so thoroughli gone that on is seen onli by a rare
accid but black bear and puma ar suffici numer to afford
fair sport provid the hunter ha a fine outfit of dog hors and
guid of pronghorn antelop sever band remain but it is
report that thei ar steadili diminish the herd and herder of
domest sheep ar blame for the decreas and i have no doubt thei
deserv it the sheep and their champion ar the implac enemi of
all wild game and befor them the game vanish everywher
the lawmak of colorado have tri hard to provid adequ statut
for the protect of the wild life of the state in fact i think that
no state ha put forth greater or more elabor effort in that
direct for exampl in 1899 under the leadership of judg dc
beaman of denver colorado initi the more game movement by
enact a veri elabor law provid for the establish of privat
game preserv and farm for the breed of game under state licens
and the tag and sale of preservebr game under state supervis
illustr bandtail pigeon
often mistaken for the passeng pigeon the rapid slaughter
of thi speci ha alarm the ornithologist of california
who now fear it extinct
the histori of game destruct in colorado is a repetit of the old
old storyplenti of law but a hundr time too mani hunter
kill the game both accord to law and contrari to it and do it
five time as fast as the game could breed that combin can safe
be warrant to wipe out the wild life of ani countri in the world and
accomplish it right swiftli
as a biggam countri colorado is distinctli out of the run her
peopl ar too lawless and her frontiersmen ar in the main far too
selfish to look upon plenteou game without go after it some of
these dai a new call of the wild will aris in colorado demand an
open season on mountain sheep those who demand it will sai what harm
will it do to kill a few surplu buck it will improv the breed and
make the herd increas faster
by all mean have an open season on the colorado bighorn and the
british columbia elk it will do them good the excit of ram
slaughter will be good for the femal will it not of cours thei
will breed faster after thatwith all the big ram dead ani surplu
wild life is a public nuisanc and should promptli be shot to piec
in colorado there is some desir that est park should be acquir as a
nation park and maintain by the govern but the strong reason
for thi have not yet appear as yet we have not heard ani reason why
the state of colorado should not herself take it and make of it a state
park and game preserv if done it could be offer as a partial
aton for her wast in throw awai her inherit of grand
game
colorado ha work to do in the preserv of her remnant of bird life
in sever respect she is behind the time the present is no time to
hesit or to ask the gunner what thei wish to have done about new
law for the save of the remnant of game the dictat of common sens
ar plain and inexor let the lawmak do their whole duti by the
remnant of wild life whether the game killer like it or not
the curs of domest sheep upon game and cattlemuch ha been said
in print and out of print regard the extent to which domest sheep
have destroi the cattl rang and incident mani game rang of
the west but the half hath not been told the american peopl as a
whole do not realiz that the domest sheep ha driven the domest

the state of delawar is nearli twenti year behind the time can it be
possibl that her governor and her peopl ar realli satisfi with that
posit we think not i dare sai thei ar afflict with apathi and
gamehog the latter can easili back up gener apathi to an extent
that spell no game law in on act and at on bold stroke delawar

and take a place in the front rank will she do it we hope so for her
present statu is unworthi of ani rightmind redblood state thi
side of the philippin
district of columbia
the sale of all nativ wild game regardless of it sourc should
be stop immedi by the enact of a complet bayn law
if gameshoot within the district is continu on the marsh of
the eastern branch and on the potomac river common decenc demand
the enact of baglimit law and long closeseason law of the
most modern pattern
just why it is that gross abus against wild life have so long been
toler in the territori center of the american nation remain to
be ascertain but whatev the reason the situat is absurd and
intoler and congress should termin it immedi as late as
1897 and i think for two or three year thereaft thousand of
robin were sold everi year in the public market of washington as
food as a spectacl for god and men behold todai the sale of quail
ruf grous wild turkei and other american game half wai between
the capitol and the white hous look at center market as a nation
fenc for the sale of game stolen by market gunner from maryland
virginia the carolina and pennsylvania
it is time for congress to bring the district of columbia sharpli into
line for washington must be made to toe the mark besid new york the
reput of the nation capit demand it whether the god of the

florida
shoot shore bird and waterfowl in late winter and spring should

the sale of all nativ wild game should be prohibit
a state game commission whose term of offic should be not less
than four year and a forc of salari game warden should be
appoint
a gener resid licens should be requir for hunt
the kill of doe and fawn should be stop and no deer should
be kill save buck with horn at least three inch long
the bag limit of five deer per year should be two deer of twenti
quail and two turkei per dai should be ten quail and on turkei
the open season on all game bird should end on februari 1 for
domest reason
protect should be accord dove and robin should be remov
from the game list
in the destruct of wild life i think the backwood popul of
florida is the most lawless and defiant that can be found anywher in
the unit state the plumehunt have practic extermin the
plumebear egret wholli annihil the roseat spoonbil the
flamingo and also the carolina parrakeet on juli 8 1905 on of them
kill an audubon associ warden gui m bradlei whose busi it
wa to enforc the state law protect the egret rookeri the peopl
realli to blame for the shoot of gui bradlei and the extermin
of the egret by lawless and danger men ar the vain and merciless
women who wear the white badg of cruelti as long as thei can be
purchas thei have much to answer for
origin florida wa aliv with bird life for number of speci
abund of individu and gener dispers throughout the whole
state i think no other state in america except possibl california ever
possess a bird fauna quit compar with it onc it bird life wa
on of the wonder of america but the gunner began earli to shoot and
shoot and shoot dure the fifteen year preced 1898 the gener
bird life of florida decreas in volum 77 per cent in 1900 it wa at
a veri low point and it ha steadili continu to decreas the
rapidlygrow settlement and cultiv of the state ha of cours
had much to do with the disappear of wild life gener and the
drain and exploit of the everglad will about finish the bird
of southern florida
the brown pelican breedingplac on pelican island in indian river
ha been taken in hand by the nation govern as a bird refug and
it marvel spectacl of pelican life is now protect nine other
island on the coast of florida have been taken as nation bird
refug and will render poster good servic
the great privat game and bird preserv of dr rai v pierc at
apalachicola known as st vincent island contain twenti squar
mile of wonder wood and water is perform an import function
for the state and the nation
the florida bag limit on quail is entir too liber i know on man
who never onc exceed the limit of twenti bird per dai but in the
season of 19089 he kill 865 quail can the quail of ani state long
endur such drain as that
from a zoolog point of view florida is in bad shape a great mani
of her peopl who shoot ar desper lawless and uncontrol and
the state is not financi abl to support a forc of warden
suffici strong to enforc the law even as thei ar it look as
if the slaughter would go on until noth of bird life remain at
present i can see no hope whatev for save even a good remnant of the
wild life of the state
the present statu of wildlif protect law in florida wa made the
subject of an articl in forest and stream of august 10 1912 by john
h wallac jr game commission of the state of alabama in an
articl entitl the florida situat in view of hi record no on
will question either the valu or the honest sincer of mr wallac
opinion the follow paragraph ar from that articl
the enact of a model and modern game law for the state of
florida is absolut imper in order to save mani of the most
valuabl speci of bird and game of that state from certain
deplet and threaten extinct the question of the protect
of the bird and game in florida is not a local on but is nation
in it scope bird know no state line and while practic all
the state ly to the north of florida protect migratori bird and
waterfowl yet these ar recklessli slaughter in that state to
such an extent as to be appal to all sportsmen and bird lover
so alarm ha becom the decreas of the bird and game of florida
that unless a halt is call on the campaign of reckless
annihil that ha been ceaselessli wage in that state the
sport and recreat enjoi by primev nimrod will linger onli in
histori and tradit
it is the sincerest hope of all lover of wild life of the american
contin that a strong and invinc sentiment rel to the
imper necess of real conserv legisl be
crystal in the mind of the member elect of the florida
legislatur to the end that the next legislatur will spread upon
the statut book of the state of florida a model and modern law for

the clamor of her shoot popul main ha actual been studi
the need of her game and provid for those need if all other
state were do equal well the task of write a book of admonit
would have been unnecessari the proof of main alert is to be
found in the number of her extra short or entir close season on

peopl who have not learn the fact habitu think of main as a

main ha wise chosen to regard her huntingground and her deer as a

state is to be a good citizen and a protector of game from illeg
slaughter no nonresid mai hunt without a licens guid the
licens for the thousand of deer kill in main each year and the
expens of the visit sportsmen who hunt them annual bring into
the state and leav there a huge sum of monei various estim at
from 2000000 to 3000000 on can onli guess at the amount from the
number of nonresid licens issu but certainli the total can not

although mr lt carleton is no longer chairman of the commiss of

at the last session of the maryland legislatur the law prevent the

michigan
on the whole the game law of michigan ar in excel shape and
leav littl to be desir in the line of better except to be
simplifi all the game protect by the law of the state is debar
from sale squirrel pinnat grous dove and wild turkei enjoi long

two or three state game preserv for deer each at least four
mile squar should be establish without delai
minnesota
thi state should at onc enact a baglimit law that will do some
good instead of the statutori farc now on the book make it
fifteen bird per dai of waterfowl all speci combin and no
grous or quail
there should be fiveyear close season enact for quail grous
plover woodcock snipe and all other shore bird
a law should be enact prohibit the us of firearm by
unnatur alien and a 20 licens for all natur alien
provis should be made for a larg state game refug in southern
minnesota
the state should prohibit the us of machin gun in hunt
todai direct and reliabl advic show that the game situat in
minnesota is far from encourag sever speci ar threaten with
extinct at an earli date in northern minnesota it is report that
much game is surreptiti trap and slaughter the bob white is
report as threaten with total extinct at an earli date but i
think the prairi chicken will be the first bird speci to go moos
will soon be extinct everywher in minnesota except in the game
preserv appar there is now about on duck in minnesota for everi
ten duck that were there onli ten year ago
now what is minnesota go to do about all thi is she will
through apathi to becom a gameless state her peopl need to arous
themselv now and pass sever strong law her bag limit of
fortyf bird per dai of quail grous woodcock and plover and
fifti per dai of the waterbird is a joke and noth more but it
is no laugh matter it spell extermin
mississippi
the legal slaughter of robin cedar bird grosbeak and dove
should ceas immedi on the basi of economi of resourc and a
squar deal to all the state ly northward of mississippi
the shoot of all waterfowl should ceas on januari 1
a reason limit should be establish on deer
a hunt licens law should be pass at onc fix the fee at 1
and devot the revenu to the pai of a corp of nonpolit game
warden select on a basi of abil and fit
the administr of the game law should be place in charg of a
salari game commission
it is serious to the discredit of mississippi that her law actual
classifi robin cedarbird grosbeak and dove as game and make
them killabl as such from sept 1 to march 1 i should think that if
no econom consider carri weight in mississippi state pride
alon would be suffici to promot a correct of the evil if we of
the north were to slaughter mockingbird for food when thei come north
to visit us the men of the south would call us greedi barbarian and
thei would be quit right
missouri
the missouri bag limit that permit the kill or possess of
fifti bird per dai ar absurd and fatal liber the utmost
should be twentyf and even that is too high
dove should be taken off the list of game bird and protect
throughout the year and so should all tree squirrel
spring shoot of shore bird and waterfowl should be prohibit
without delai
a law against automat and pump gun should be enact at the next
legisl session as a public lesson on the rais of the
standard of ethic in shoot
the state of missouri is realli strong in her posit as a
gameprotect state she perpetu protect such vanish speci
as the ruf grous prairi chicken pinnat grous woodcock and
all her shore bird save snipe and plover she prohibit the sale of
nativ game and the kill of femal deer but she wise permit the
sale of preservebr elk and deer under the tag of the state game
commiss for nearli all the wild game that is access her market
ar tightli close
we heartili congratul missouri on her advanc posit on the sale
of game and we hope that the peopl of iowa will even yet profit by her
good exampl
montana
like colorado and wyom montana is wast a valuabl heritag of
wild game while she struggl to maintain the theori that she still is
in the list of state that furnish biggam hunt it is a fact that
ten year ago most sportsmen began to regard montana as a hasbeen for
big game and began to seek better huntingground elsewher british
columbia alberta and alaska have done much for the game of montana by
draw sportsmen awai from it mr henri avar the state game warden
is optimist regard even the big game and believ that it is
hold it own thi is partial true of whitetail deer or it wa
up to the time of great slaughter it is said that in 1911 11000 deer
were kill in montana all in the western part of the state seventi
per cent of which were whitetail the deep snow and extrem cold of a
long and unusu sever winter drove the hungri deer down out of the
mountain into the settlement where the ranchmen joyous slaughter
them the destruct around kalispel wa describ by harri p
stanford as sicken
mr avar estim the pronghorn antelop in montana at three
thousand head of which about six hundr ar under the quasiprotect
of four ranch
the antelop need three or four small rang such as the snow creek
antelop rang where the bad land ar too rough for ranchmen but
quit right for antelop and other big game
all the grous and ptarmigan of montana need a fiveyear close
season the splendid sage grous is now extinct in mani part of it
previou rang fiftyeight thousand licens gunner ar too mani
for them
the few mountain sheep and mountain goat that surviv should have a
fiveyear close season at onc
the kill of femal hoof anim should be prohibit by law
montana ha not yet adopt the model law for the protect of
nongam bird onli seven state have fail in that respect
the us of automat and pump shotgun and silenc should
immedi be prohibit
montana baglimit ar not wholli bad but the grizzli bear ha almost
been extermin save in the yellowston park some of these dai if
thing go on as thei ar now go the peopl of montana will be rude
awaken to the fact that thei have 50000 licens hunter but no
longer ani killabl game and then we will hear enthusiast talk about
restock
nebraska
no other state ha bestow close season upon as mani extinct speci
of game as nebraska behold how she ha resolut lock the door of
her empti cage after all these speci have flown elk antelop wild
turkei passeng pigeon whoop crane sage grous ptarmigan and
curlew in a short time the pinnat grous can be ad to the list of
hasbeen
there is littl to sai regard the futur of the game of nebraska for

new jersei
new jersei enjoi the distinct of be the second state to break
the stranglehold of the gunmak of hartford and ilion and cast out
the odiou automat and pump gun it wa a pitch battlethat of
1912 inaugur by ernest napier presid of the state game and fish

thi contest arous the whole state to the imper necess of
provid more thorough protect for the remnant of new jersei game
and it wa chiefli respons for the enact of four other excel
new protect law
new jersei alwai ha been sincer in her desir to protect her wild
life and alwai ha gone as far as the killer of game would permit
her to go but the peopl have made on great mistakecommon to
nearli everi stateof permit the gamekil to dictat the game
law alwai and everywher thi is a grievou mistak and fatal to
the game for exampl in 1866 new jersei enact a fiveyear
closeseason law on the prairi fowl pinnat grous but it wa too
late to save it now that speci is as dead to new jersei as is the
mastodon the moral is will the peopl appli thi lesson to the ruf
grous quail and the shore bird gener befor thei too ar too
far gone to be brought back if it is done it must be done against the
will of the gunner for thei prefer to shootand shoot thei will if
thei can dictat the law until the last game bird is dead
in 1912 new jersei is spend 30000 in try to restock her

new mexico
all thing consid the game law of new mexico ar surprisingli up
to date and the state is to be congratul on it advanc posit
for exampl there ar long close season on antelop elk now
extinct mountain sheep bob white quail pinnat grous wild pigeon
and ptarmiganan admir list truli it is clear that new mexico is
wide awak to the danger of the wildlif situat on two count her
law ar not quit perfect there is no law prohibit spring shoot
and there is no model law protect the nongam bird the sale of
game will not troubl new mexico becaus the present law prevent the
sale of all protect game except plover curlew and snipeal of them
speci by no mean common in the arid region of the southwest
a law prohibit spring shoot of shore bird and waterfowl
should be pass at the next session of the legislatur
the enact of the model law should be accomplish without
delai to put new mexico abreast of the neighbor state of
colorado oklahoma and texa
the term of the state warden should be extend to four year
new york
in the year of grace 1912 i think we mai justli regard new york as the
banner state of all america in the protect of game and wild life in
gener thi proud posit ha been achiev partli through the
influenc of a great conserv governor john a dix and the state
conserv commiss propos and creat by hi effort in these
dai of game destruct when our countri from nome to kei west is
reek with the blood of slaughter wild creatur it is a privileg
and a pleasur to be a citizen of a state which ha thoroughli clean
hous and done well nigh the utmost that ani state can do to clear her
bad record and give all her wild creatur a fair chanc to surviv
the peopl of the empir state liter can point with pride to the
list of thing accomplish in the discharg of goodcitizenship toward
the remnant of wild life and toward the futur gener of new
yorker that we of todai have born our share of the burden of
bring about the condit of 1912 will be a sourc of satisfact
especi when the sword and shield hang useless upon the wall of old
ag
new york began to protect her deer in 1705 and her heath hen in 1708
in 1912 she stop the kill of femal deer and of buck have
horn less than three inch in length spring shoot wa stop in
1903 a comprehens law protect nongam bird wa enact in 1862
new york first law against the sale of certain game dure close
season wa enact in 1837
in 1911 new york enact with onli on advers vote a law prohibit
the sale of all nativ wild game throughout the state no matter where
kill and provid liber for the encourag of gamebreed
and the sale of preservebr game
in 1912 a new codif of the state game law went into effect
through the initi of governor dix and conserv commission
van kennen moor and fleme assist as special counsel by marshal
mclean georg a lawyer and john b burnham thi code contain mani
import new provis on of the most valuabl of which is a claus
give the conserv commiss power at it discret to shorten
or to close ani open season on ani speci of game in ani local
wherein that speci seem to be threaten with extermin thi
veri valuabl principl should be enact into law in everi state
in 1910 william dutcher and t gilbert pearson and the nation
associ of audubon societi won after a struggl last five
year the passag of the shea plumag bill prohibit the sale of
aigrett or other plumag of wild bird belong to the same famili
as the bird of new york chap 256 thi law should be duplic in
everi state
two thing remain to be done in the state of new york
all the shore bird quail and grai squirrel of the state should be
given fiveyear close season by the action of the state
conserv commiss
for the good name of the state and the ethic stand of it
sportsmen as an exampl to other state and the last remain
duti toward our wild life the odiou automat and pump shotgun
should be bar from us in hunt unless their capac is
reduc to two shot without reload
chapter xxxi
new law need in the state
conclud
north carolina
the game law of north carolina form a droll crazyquilt of local and
state measur effect and ineffect in 1909 a total of 77 local
game law were enact and onli two of statewid applic dure
the ten year end in 1910 a total of 316 game law were enact she
sedul endeavor to protect her quail which do not migrat but in
currituck counti she persist maintain the bloodiest slaughterpen
for waterfowl that exist anywher on the atlant coast there is no
bag limit on waterfowl and unlimit spring shoot so far as
waterfowl ar concern condit could hardli be wors except by the
us of punt gun dove lark and robin ar shot and eaten as
game from novemb 1 to march 1 twentyon counti have local
restrict on the sale of game but the state at larg ha onli
oneon quail
the market gunner of currituck sound ar a scourg and a pest to the
wildfowl life of the atlant coast for their own monei profit thei
slaughter by wholesal the bird that annual fly through twentytwo
state it is quit useless to suggest anyth to north carolina in
modern game law as long as a killabl bird remain she will not stop
the slaughter her stand repli is it bring a lot of monei into
currituck counti and the peopl want the monei even the member of
the sportsmen club can shoot wild fowl in currituck counti quit
without limit and i am told that the privileg often is abus quit
recent i heard of a member of on of the club who shot 164 duck and
gees in two dai
appar ani suggest made to north carolina would not be treat
serious especi if thei would tend realli to elev the sport of
game shoot or better protect the game there is howev a
melancholi interest attach to the frame of good game law whether
thei ever ar like to be adopt or not here is the duti of north
carolina
stop the kill of robin dove and lark for food absolut and
forev thi measur is necessari to agricultur and to the good
name of the state
stop the shoot of ani game for sale prohibit the possess of
game for sale and the sale of wild nativ game
establish bag limit on all waterfowl and on all other game bird
and mammal
prepar to protect at an earli date the wild turkei and quail
for soon thei will need it moreov enact a law prohibit the
us of automat and pump gun in hunt cover the entir
state
provid a residentlicens system and therebi make the game
depart selfsustain and render it possibl to emploi a
salari state game commission
it is quit wrong for the peopl of north carolina to hold grudg
against northern member of the duck club of currituck for the
passag of the bayn law thei had noth whatev to do with it and i
can sai thi becaus i wa in a posit which enabl me to know
north dakota
in 1911 thi sovereign state enact a law prohibit the us of
automobil in hunt wildfowl also rifl north dakota wa the
first state to recogn offici the fact that the us of automobil
in hunt is a seriou menac to some form of wild life beyond all
question the machin do inde bring an extra number of bird within
reach of the gun thei increas the annual slaughter and it is right
and necessari to prohibit by law their us in hunt game of ani kind
in putman counti new york i have seen them in action a load of three
or four gunner is whirl up to a like mountainsid for ruf
grous and present the bang begin after an hour or so spent in
comb out the bird the hunter jump in whirl awai in a dustcloud
to anoth spot two mile awai and bangbangbang again after that
a third local and so on cover six or eight time the territori
that a man in a buggi or on foot could possibl shoot over in the same
time
north dakota ha done well in the passag of that act on certain other
matter she is not so sound
for instanc
the kill of pinnat grous should be stop for ten year and
it should be done immedi
the kill of crane as game should stop instantli and forev
it is barbar
fifti dead bird in possess at on time is fulli thirti too mani
the game cannot stand such slaughter
all shore bird order limicola should have at least a fiveyear
close season befor thei ar extermin
the us of machin gun in hunt should be stop forev
it is to the credit of the state that antelop ar absolut protect
until 1920 and an unlimit close season ha been accord the quail
dove and swan
ohio
i think that ohio come the nearest of all the state to be gameless
with but slight except her law ar about as correct as those of
most other state but the desir to kill is so strong and the
major of her gunner ar so thoroughli selfish about their right
that the game ha ruthlessli been swept awai accord to law ohio
is a strike exampl of the deplor result of legal
slaughter the spirit of ohio is like that of north carolina her
sportsmen will not have an automat gun law oh no limit the bag
shorten the season and the gun wont matter
todai the visibl game suppli of ohio doe not amount to anyth and
when the last game bird of that state fall befor the greediest
shooter we shall sai a gameless state is just what you deserv
it is useless to make ani suggest to ohio her shoot shylock
want the last pound of flesh from wild life and i think thei will get
it veri soon ohio is in the area of barren state the seed stock ha
been too thoroughli destroi to be recuper i think that ohio
last noteworthi exploit in lawmak for the preserv of her
game wa in 1904 when she put all her shore bird into the list of
killabl game and brave prohibit the shoot of dove on the
ground great is ohio in game conserv
oklahoma
for a state so young the wildlif law of oklahoma ar in admir
shape but it is reason certain that there as elsewher the game
is be kill much faster than it is breed the new commonwealth
must arous and screw up the brake much tighter
recent an observ friend told me that on a trip of 250 mile
westward from lawton and back again watch sharpli for game all the
wai he saw onli five pinnat grous and thi in a good season for
prairi chicken
oklahoma must stop all spring shoot
the prairi chicken must have a tenyear close season immedi
next time her legislatur will pass the automat gun bill that
fail last year onli becaus the session close too soon for it
consider
oklahoma is wise in give long protect to her quail and wild
pigeon and such protect should be made equal effect in the
case of the dove she is wise in rigidli enforc her law against the
export of game
the wichita nation bison herd near cach now contain forti head of
bison all in good condit the nucleu herd consist of fifteen head
present by the new york zoolog societi in 1907
oregon
the result of the effort that have been made by oregon to provid
special law for each individu shooter ar pain to contempl
like north carolina oregon ha attempt the imposs task of
pleas everybodi and at the same time protect her wild life the
two proposit can be blend togeth about as easili as asphalt and
water the individu shooter desir law that will permit him to
shootwhen he pleas where he pleas and what he pleas if
you meet those condit all over a great state then it is time to bid
farewel to the game for it sure is doom
no decidedli no do not attempt to pass game law that will pleas
everybodi the more the gamehog ar displeas the better for the
game the gamehog form a veri small and veri insignific minor of
the whole peopl why pleas on man at the expens of ninetynin
other the game of a state belong to the peopl as a whole not to the
gunner alon the great patientand sometim sleepymajor ha
vest right in it and it is for it to sai how it shall and shall not
be kill heretofor the gun minor ha been dictat the game
law of america and the result isprogress extermin
first of all oregon should buri the pernici idea of individu
and local law
she should enact a concis clearli cut and thoroughli effect
code of wild life law just as new york did last winter
her game season should be uniform in applic all over the
state
everi speci of bird mammal or fish that is threaten with
extermin should be given a close season of from five to ten
year
it is now time to protect the white goos and brant squirrel
bandtail pigeon and dove should be perpetu protect
the state game commiss should have power to close the shoot
season on ani speci of game in ani local whenev a speci
is threaten with extinct
the sale of nativ wild game from all sourc should be
perman stop by a bayn law
the us of automat autoload and pump shot gun in hunt
should be perpetu bar
pennsylvania
as a game protect state pennsylvania is a close second to new york
and massachusett she protect all nativ game from sale she ha the
courag to prohibit alien from own gun she bar out automat
shotgun in hunt she make refug for deer and feed her quail
in winter and she permit the kill of no femal deer or fawn with
horn less than three inch in length her splendid state game
commiss is fight hard for a hunter licens law and will win the
fight for it at the next session of the legislatur 1913
but there ar certain thing that pennsylvania should do
she should stop all spring shoot she must stop kill dove
blackbird wild turkei sandpip and all the squirrel save the
red squirrel
she should give all her shore bird a rest of at least five year
for recuper
she should enact a comprehens dutcher plumag law stop the
sale of aigrett
she should provid a resid licens to furnish her game commiss
with adequ fund to carri on it work and extermin
gamekil vermin
rhode island
littl rhodi need some good small bag limit for now 1912 she
ha none
she should enact a bayn law a pennsylvania law against alien
and a new jersei law against the automat and pump gun
she should stop kill the beauti woodduck and grai squirrel
she should stop all spring shoot of waterfowl
south carolina
she should save her game while she still ha some to save
first of all stop spring shoot secondli enact a bayn law
in the name of mysteri who is there in south carolina who desir
to kill grackl and why
and where is the gentleman sportsman who ha come down to kill
foolish and tame littl dove for sport stop it at onc for the
credit of the state
enact a dollar resid licens law and thu provid adequ fund
for game protect
south carolina bag limit ar all 50 per cent too high and thei
should be reduc
it is strang to see on of the oldest of the state lag in game
protect far behind such new state as new mexico and oklahoma but
south carolina doe lag it is time for her to consid her posit
and reform
south dakota
south dakota should stop all spring shoot
her gamebag limit ar realli no limit at all thei should be
reduc about 66 per cent without a moment unnecessari delai
the two year term of the state warden is too short for effect
work it should be extend to four year
unless south dakota wish to repeat the folli of such state as
indiana iowa illinoi missouri and ohio she need to be up and
do if her peopl want a gameless state except for migratori
waterfowl all thei need do is to slumber on and thei sure will have
it why wait until greedi sportsmen have kill the last game bird of
the state befor serious take the matter in hand in on act all
the shortcom of the present law can be correct
south dakota need no bayn law becaus she prohibit at all time the
sale or export of all wild game
tennesse
in wild life protect tennesse ha much to do she made her start
late in life and what she need to do is to draft with care and enact
with cheer alacr certain necessari amend
we notic that there ar open season for blackbird robin dove and
squirrel it seem incred but it is true
behold the blackbird as a game bird with a law open season from
septemb 1 to januari 1 consid it state carriag it rapid

texa
i rememb well when the great battl wa fought in texa by the gallant
men and women of the state audubon societi to compel the peopl of
texa to learn the econom valu to agricultur and cotton of the
insectivor bird the name of the splendid brigadiergener who led
the armi of the defens wa capt mb davi that wa in 1903
sinc that great fight wa won texa ha been a partli reform state
at time quit jealou of her bird life but still she toler spring
shoot and ha not made adequ close season for her waterfowl
which is wrong todai the peopl of texa do not need to be told that
fortythre speci of bird feed on the cotton boll weevil for thei
know it
on the whole and for a southern state the wildlif law of texa ar
in fairli good shape on account of the absenc of gamescourg market
a bayn law is not so imper necessari there as in certain other
state all the game of the state is protect from sale
we do assert howev that if robin ar slaughter as fl crow the
former atlantan assert all robin shoot should be forev stop
that the pinnat grous should be given a sevenyear close season and
that dove should be taken off the list of game bird and perpetu
protect both for econom and sentiment reason and also becaus
the too weak and confid dove is not a game bird for redblood
men
texa should enact without delai a law provid close season for
duck gees and other waterfowl
a law prohibit spring shoot and
a provis reduc the limit on deer to two buck a season
utah
the law of utah ar far from be up to the requir of the
present hour on strang thing ha happen in utah

abat a portion of the disgrac by pass a baglimit law 1897
and then came natur punish upon utah for that duck slaughter the

diseas intestin coccidiosi which swept off thousand and stop
the us of utah duck as food it wa a duck plagu no less it ha

said to be terribl
todai utah is so nearli destitut of big game that the subject is
hardli worthi of mention of her upland game bird onli a fraction

vermont
in view of all condit it must be state that the game law of
vermont ar with but slight except in good condit it is a
pleasur to see that there is no spring shoot that there is no
open season of slaughter for the moos carib woodduck swan
upland plover dove or rail that no buck deer with antler less than
three inch long mai be kill and that there is a law under which

virginia
virginia is far below the posit that she should occupi in wildlif

washington
the state of washington still flatter herself that she ha all kind of
big game to killmoos antelop goat sheep carib and deer
evid thi is on the theori that so long as a speci is not

enact in 1875 against spring shoot ha been repeal and so ha
the resid hunt licens law 1911
in view of the imposs of imagin a good reason for the repeal
of a good law we recommend
that the law against spring shoot be reenact
that the resid hunter licens law be reenact and the
proce specif devot to the preserv and increas of
game
that a forc of regular salari warden be provid to enforc the
law
that the bag limit on quail should be 10 per dai or 40 per season
instead of 12 and 96 and on ruf grous it should be 3 per dai
as in new york or 12 per season on wild turkei per dai or three
per season is quit enough for on man the visibl suppli will not
justifi the exist limit of two and six

thi moment wisconsin ha a good seri of game law but the hour for
a reform of idea and principl ha struck we heard it first in
april 1911 the wild life of america must not be extermin accord
to law contrari to law or in the absenc of law wisconsin must take
a fresh grip on her game situat or it will get awai from her after
all
not anoth prairi chicken or woodcock should be kill in

scarc that the bag limit need to be cut down to five as it now is
for the abov in wisconsin it is time to stop for ten year befor

in the protect of her mountain game wyom ha had a hard task in
the yellowston park between 1889 and 1894 the poacher for the
taxidermist of livingston and elsewher slaughter 270 bison out of

need for a feder migratori bird law nosaleofgam law and other
we ar assum that the american peopl sincer desir the adequ
protect and increas of bird life for reason that ar both
sentiment and commerci sure everi good citizen dislik to see
million of dollar worth of nation wealth foolishli wast and he
dislik to pai ani unnecessari increas cost of live there must be
sever million of american who feel that wai and who ar dispos to
demand a complet revolut in bird protect
there ar four need of wild bird life that ar fundament and that
can not be ignor ani more than a builder can ignor the four
cornerston of hi build list in the order of their import
thei ar as follow
1the feder protect of all migratori bird
2the total suppress of the sale of nativ wild game
3the total suppress of spring shoot and of shoot in the
breed season and
4long close season for all speci that ar about to be shot
out
if the gunner of america wish to have a gameless contin all thei
need do to secur it is to oppos these principl prevent their
translat into law and maintain the statu quo if thei do thi then
all our best bird ar doom to swift destruct let no man make a
mistak on that point the open season and bag limit of the unit
state todai ar just as deadli as the 5000000 sport gun now in
us and the 700000000 annual cartridg it is onli the ignor or
the viciou who will serious disput thi statement
the feder protect of migratori birdsth bill now befor congress
for the protect of all migratori bird by the nation govern is
the most import measur ever place befor that bodi in behalf of
wild life a stranger to thi proposit will need to paus for thought
in order to grasp it full mean and appreci the magnitud of it
influenc
the urgent necess for a law of thi natur is due to the utter
inadequaci of the law that prevail throughout some portion of the
unit state concern the slaughter and preserv of bird ani
law that is not enforc is a poor law there is not on state in the
union nor a singl provinc in canada in which the game bird and
other bird crimin shot as game ar not be kill far faster
than thei ar breed and therebi be extermin
sever state ar financi unabl to emploi a forc of salari game
warden and wherev that is true the door to univers slaughter is
wide open let him who question thi take virginia as a case in point
a loyal virginian told me onli thi year that in hi state the warden
system is an ineffect farc and the game is not protect becaus
the warden can not afford to patrol the state for noth
thi condit prevail in a number of state north and south
especi south it is my belief that throughout ninetenth of the
south the negro and poor white ar slaughter bird exactli as
thei pleas it is the perman resid of the haunt of bird and
game that ar extermin the wild life
the valu of the bird as destroy of noxiou insect ha been set
forth in chapter xxiii their total valu is enormousor it would be
if the bird were aliv and here in their normal number todai there
ar about onetenth as mani bird as were aliv and work thirti year
ago dure the past thirti year the destruct of our game bird ha
been enorm and the insectivor bird have greatli decreas
the damag annual inflict upon the farm orchard and garden crop
of thi countri ar veri great when a citi is destroi by earthquak
or fire and 100000000 worth of properti is swept awai we ar rack
with horror and piti and the citi of america pour out monei like
water to reliev the result distress we ar shock becaus we can
see the flame the smoke and the ruin
and yet we annual endur with perfect equanim becaus we can not
see it a loss of nearli 400000000 worth of valu that is destroi
by insect the damag is inflict silent insidi without ani
scare head or wooden type in the newspap and so we pai the price
without protest we knowwhen we stop to think of itthat not all thi
loss fall upon the produc we know that everi consum of bread
cereal veget and fruit pai hi share of thi loss todai
million of peopl ar groan under the increas cost of live
the bill for the feder protect of all migratori bird is directli
intend to decreas the cost of live by prevent outrag wast
but of all the person to whom the need of that bill ar present how
mani will take the time to promot it quick passag by direct appeal
to their member of congress we shall see
the good that would be accomplish annual by the enact of a law
for the feder protect of all migratori bird is beyond comput
but it is my belief that within a veri few year the increas in bird
life would prevent what is now an annual loss of 250000000 it is
beyond the power of man to protect hi crop and fruit and tree as the
bird million would protect themif thei were here as thei were in
1870 the migratori bird bill is of vast import becaus it would
throw the strong arm of feder protect around 610 speci of bird
the power of uncl sam is respect and fear in mani place where the
power of the state is ignor
the list of migratori bird includ most of the perch bird all the
shore bird great destroy of bad insect all the swift and
swallow the goatsuck whippoorwil and nighthawk some of the
woodpeck most of the rail pigeon and dove mani of the hawk
some of the crane and heron and all the gees duck and swan
a movement for the feder protect of migratori game bird wa
propos to congress by georg shira 3rd who as a member of the hous
in the 58th congress introduc a bill to secur that end an excel
brief on that subject by mr shira appear in the print hear on

ow it to himself to write at onc to hi member of congress and ask
him 1 to urg the speedi consider of the bill for the feder
protect of all migratori bird 2 to vote for it and 3 to work
for it until it is pass it matter not which on of the three bill
describ final becom a law will the american peopl act ration
about thi matter and protect their own interest
suppress the sale of all nativ wild gameth deadli effect of the
commerci slaughter of game and it sale for food is now becom well
understood by the american peopl on by on the variou state
legislatur have been put up the bar against the export or
sale of ani game protect by the state the us depart of
agricultur sai through henri oldi that free market of wild game
lead swiftli to extermin and it is liter true
up to march 1911 it appear that sever state prohibit the sale of
game sixteen state permit the sale of all unprotect game and in
eight more there wa partial prohibit unfortun howev mani
of these state permit the sale of import game now sinc it
happen to be a fact that the vast major of the state prohibit the
export of their game as well as the sale of it a veri larg quantiti
of such game as quail ruf grous snipe woodcock and shore bird
wa illeg shot for the market export in defianc both of state
law and the feder lacei act and sold to the detriment of the state
that produc it in other word in the law of each state that mere
sought to protect their own game regardless of the game of
neighbor state there wa not mere a loophol but there wa a
gap wide enough to drive through with a coach and four the ruf
grous of massachusett and connecticut often were butcher to make
gotham holidai in joyou contempt of the law at both end of the line
as a natur result the game of the atlant coast wa disappear at a
fright rate
illustr eighteen state entir prohibit the sale of game why do
the other lag behind
in 1911 the nosaleofgam law of new york wa born out of sheer
desper the armi of destruct went up to albani wellorgan
well provid with monei and attornei with three senat in the
senat and two assemblymen in the lower hous to wage merciless warfar
on the whole wildlif caus the market gunner and game dealer not
onli propos to repeal the law against spring shoot but also to
defeat all legisl that might be attempt to restrict the sale of
game or impos bag limit on wild fowl the millin associ
propos to wipe off the book the dutcher law against the us of the
plumag of wild bird in millineri and an assemblyman wa commit to
that caus as it special champion
then it wa that all the friend of wild life in the empir state
resolv upon a death grappl with the destroy and a fight to an
absolut finish the bayn bill entir prohibit the sale of all
nativ wild game throughout the state of new york wa draft and
thrown into the ring and the struggl began at first the
nosaleofgam bill look like sheer mad but no sooner wa it
fairli launch than support came flock in from everi side all
the organ of sportsmen and friend of wild life combin in on
mighti armi the strength of which wa irresist the real sportsmen
of the state quickli realiz that the nosal bill wa directli in the
interest of legitim sport the great mass of peopl who love wild
life and never kill were quick to comprehend the farreach
import of the measur and thei support it with monei and
enthusiasm
the member of the legislatur receiv thousand of letter from their
constitu ask them to support the bayneblauvelt bill thei did
so on it passag through the two hous onli on vote wa record
against it incident everi move attempt by the armi of
destruct wa defeat and in the final sum up the defeat amount
to an utter rout
in 1912 after a tremend struggl the legislatur of massachusett
pass a counterpart of the bayn law and took her place in the front
rank of state that wa a great fight the marketgunn of cape cod
the game dealer and other interest enter the struggl with men in
the lower hous of the legislatur special elect to look after their
interest just as in new york in 1911 thei propos to repeal the
exist law against spring shoot and throw the market wide open to
the sale of game from first to last through three long and stormi
month the destroy fought with a degre of determin and
persist worthi of a better caus thei contest with the defend
everi inch of ground in new york the destroy were overwhelm by
the tidal wave of defend but in massachusett it wa a prolong
handtohand fight on the rampart five time wa a bill to repeal
the springshoot law introduc and defeat
even after the bill had pass both hous by good major the
governor declar that he could not sign it and then there pour into
the execut offic such a flood of caller letter telegram and
telephon call that he becam convinc that the peopl desir the
law so he sign the bill in defer to the wish of the major
the principl that the sale of game is wrong and fatal to the exist
of a suppli of game is as fix and unassail as the rocki
mountain it univers accept is onli a question of intellig
and common honesti the open state ow it to themselv and each other
to enact both the spirit and the letter of the bayn law and do it
quickli befor it is too late to profit by it let them rememb the
heath henampli protect when entir too late to save it from
extinct
it is fairli beyond question that the kill of wild game for the
market and it sale in the open season and out of it is
respons for the disappear of at least fifti per cent of our
stock of american feather game it is the marketgunn the gamehog
who shoot for sport and sell hi game and the game dealer who have
swept awai the wild duck the ruf grous the quail and the prairi
chicken that thirti year ago were abund on their natur rang

chicago and the east to slaughter their own legitim game by the

all our feather game is rapidli slip awai from us ar we go
to save anyth from the wreck will we so weakli manag the game
situat that later on there will be no legitim birdshoot for
our younger son and our grandson
all law that permit the kill of game for the market and the sale of
it afterward ar class legisl of the worst sort thei permit a
hundr men selfishli to slaughter for their own pocket the game that
rightfulli belong to a hundr thousand men and boi who shoot for the
legitim recreat that such field sport afford will ani of the
sportsmen of america stand for thi until the game is all gone
the peopl who pai big price for game in the hotel and restaur of
our big citi ar not men who need that game as food far from it
thei can obtain score of fine meat dish without destroi the wild
flock in civil countri wild game is no longer necessari as
food to satisfi hunger and ward off starvat in the unit state
the dai of the hungri indianfight pioneer ha gone by and there is
an abund of food everywher
the time to tempor and feel timid over the game situat ha gone
by the situat is desper and noth but strong and vigor
measur will avail anyth worth while the sale of all wild game
should be stop everywher and at all season throughout all north
america and throughout the world todai thi particular curs is be
felt even in india
it is the duti of everi true sportsman everi farmer who own a gun and
everi lover of wild life to enter into the campaign for the passag of
bill absolut prohibit all traffic in wild game no matter what it
origin of cours the market hunter the gamehog and the game dealer
will bitterli oppos them and hire a lobbi to attempt to defeat them
but the fight for nosaleofgam is now on and it must not stop short
of complet victori
reason why the sale of wild game should ceas everywher
1becaus fulli 95 per cent of our legitim stock of feather
game ha alreadi been destroi
2becaus if marketgun and the sale of game continu ten
year longer all our feather game will be swept awai
3becaus when the sale of game wa permit on dealer wa abl
to sell 1000000 game bird per year in new york citi so he
himself said
4becaus it is a fix fact that everi wild speci of mammal
bird or reptil that is pursu for moneymak purpos eventu
is wipe out of exist even the whale of the sea ar no
except
5becaus at least 50 per cent of the decreas in our feather
game is due to marketgun and the sale of game look at the
prairi chicken of the mississippi vallei and the ruf grous of
new england
6becaus the law that permit the commerci slaughter of wild
bird for the benefit of less than five per cent of the inhabit
of ani state ar directli against the interest of the 95 per cent of
other peopl to whom that game partli belong
7becaus game kill for sale is not intend to satisfi
hunger the peopl who eat game in larg citi do not know what
hunger is save by hearsai purchas game is us chiefli in
overfeed and as a rule it doe far more harm than good
8becaus the greatest valu to be deriv from ani game bird is
in see it and photograph it and enjoi it live compani
in it nativ haunt who will love the forest when thei becom
destitut of wild life and desol
9becaus stop the sale of game will help bring back the game
bird to us in a few year
10becaus the pace that new york and massachusett have set in
thi matter will render it easier to procur the passag of bayn
law in other state
11becaus those who legitim desir game for their tabl can
be suppli from the game farm and preserv that now ar come
into exist
when new york farreach bayn bill becam a law the follow dead
bird lai in cold storag in new york citi

thei repres the last slaughter of american game for new york
todai the remain plaguespot ar chicago philadelphia san
francisco baltimor washington and new orlean but in new orlean the
brake have at last 1912 been appli and the market slaughter that
formerli prevail in that state ha at least been check
as an instanc of persist market shoot on the greatest duck
water of the eastern unit state i offer thi report from a
trustworthi agent sent to currituck sound north carolina in march
1911
i beg to submit the follow inform rel to the number of
wild duck and gees ship from thi market and kill in the
water of back bai and the upper or north end of currituck sound
from octob 20th to march 1st inclus
approxim there were kill and ship in the territori abov
name 130000 to 135000 wild duck and between 1400 and 1500 wild
gees from currituck sound and it tributari there were ship
approxim 200000 wild duck
you will see from the abov figur that each year the market
shooter exact a tremend toll from the wild water fowl in these
water and it is onli a question of a short time when the wild duck
will be extermin unless we can stop the ruthless slaughter the
last few year i have note a great decreas in the number of wild
duck some of the speci ar practic extinct i have secur
the abov inform from a most reliabl sourc and the figur
given approxim cannot be question
the effect of the passag of the bayn law close the greatest
american market against the sale of game wa an immedi decreas of
fulli fifti per cent in the number of duck and gees slaughter on
currituck sound the dealer refus to bui the bird and onehalf the
killer were compel to hang up their gun and go to work the
duckslaughter felt veri much enrag by the passag of the law and
at first were inclin to blame the northern member of currituck
duck club for the passag of the measur but as a matter of fact
not on of the person blame took ani part whatev in the campaign for
the new law
the unfair of spring shootingth shoot of game bird in late
winter and spring is to be mention onli to be condemn it is grossli
unfair to the bird outrag in principl and most unsportsmanlik
no matter whether the law permit it or not why it is that ani state
like iowa for exampl can go on kill game in spring is more than i
can understand i have endeavor to find a reason for it in iowa but
the onli real reason isth boi want the bird
i think we have at last reach the point where it mai truthfulli be
said that now no gentleman shoot bird in spring if the plea is made
that if we dont shoot duck in the spring we cant shoot them at all
then the answer isif you cant shoot game like highmind
redblood sportsman dont shoot it at all a gentleman can not
afford to barter hi stand and hi own selfrespect for a few duck
shot in the spring when the bird ar go north to lai their egg and
the man who insist on shoot in spring mai just as well go right on
and do variou other thing that ar beyond the pale such as shoot
quail on the ground shoot doe and fawn and fish for trout with gang
hook
there ar no longer two side to what onc wa the spring shoot
question even among savag the breed period of the wild creatur
is under taboo then if ever mai the beast and bird cry king
excus it ha been posit state in print that highclass fox
hound have been known to refus to chase a pregnant fox even when in
full view
chapter xxxiii
bring back the vanish bird and game
the most charm trait of wildlif charact is the alacr and
confid with which wild bird and mammal respond to the friendli
advanc of human friend those who ar not veri familiar with the
mental trait of our wild neighbor mai at first find it difficult to
comprehend the marvel celer with which both bird and mammal
recogn friendli overtur from man and respond to them
at the present junctur thi state of the wildanim mind becom a
factor of great import in determin what we can do to prevent the
extermin of speci and to promot the increas and return of wild
life
i think that there is not a singl wild mammal or bird speci now
live that can not or doe not quickli recogn protect and
take advantag of it the most conspicu of all familiar exampl ar
the wild anim of the yellowston park thei embrac the elk mountain
sheep antelop mule deer the black bear and even the grizzli no on
can sai precis how long those sever speci were in ascertain
that it wa safe to trust themselv within easi rifleshot of man but
i think it wa about five year bird recogn protect far more
quickli than mammal in a compar short time the natur wild
and wari big game of the yellowston park becam about as tame as rang
cattl it wa at least fifteen year ago that the mule deer began to
frequent the parad ground at the mammoth hot spring militari post and
receiv there their ration of hai
whenev you see a beauti photograph of a larg band of bighorn
sheep or mule deer taken at short rang amid rocki mountain sceneri you
ar safe in label it as have come from the yellowston park the
pronghorn antelop herd is so tame that it is difficult to keep it
out of the street of gardin on the montana side of the line
but the bear who ha not heard the stori of the bear of the
yellowston parkhow black bear and grizzli stalk out of the wood
everi dai to the garbag dumpingground how black bear actual have
come into the hotel for food without break the truce and how the
grizzli boldli raid the grubwagon and cooktent of camper take
just what thei pleas becaus thei know that no man dare to shoot
them inde those raid bear long ago becam a public nuisanc and
mani of them have been caught in steel boxtrap and ship to
zoolog garden in order to get them out of the wai and yet
outsid the park boundari everywher the bear ar as wari and wild

tame wild bird is a new field in natur studi and on never can

while in other case it ha taken from fifteen minut to a whole dai
chip sparrow that frequent my doorwai i have tame in two dai a
nuthatch requir three hour befor it would fly to my hand although
it took food from my stick the first time it wa offer when you find
a bird on her nest it is of cours much easier to tame that individu
than if you had to follow it about in the open and wait for it to come
within reach of a stick by exercis extrem caution and approach
inch by inch i have climb a tree to the nest of a yellowthro
vireo and at the first attempt hand the bird a mealworm with my

their nest last spring and have just finish rear nine fine
healthi young bird whenev you see a woodduck rise and fly in our

a year ago a covei of eleven quail appear in the park and have
persist remain ever sinc last fall and winter thei came at

for them
when we first occupi the zoolog park ground in 1899 there wa
not on wild rabbit in the whole 264 acr present the speci

an object lesson in protectiona remark object lesson in the

page of recreat magazin in june 1903 when that public wa
edit by go shield the articl wa entitl a haven of refug
and the place describ well deserv the name it is imposs for me
to impress upon the reader of thi volum with suffici forc and
clear the splendid success that is easili attain in encourag

well told by mr charl c townsend in the public refer to

on mile north of the littl villag of mosca colorado in san lui
vallei live the famili of jc grai on the grai ranch there is an
artesian well which empti into a small pond about 100 feet squar
thi pond is never entir frozen over and the water empti
therein is warm even dure the coldest winter
some five year ago mr grai secur a few wildduck egg and
hatch them under a hen the littl duck were rear and fed on
the littl pond the follow spring thei left the place to return
in the fall bring with them brood of young also bring other
duck to the home where protect wa afford them and plenti of
good feed wa provid each year sinc the duck have scatter in
the spring to mate and rear their famili return again with
greatli increas number in the fall and again bring stranger
to the haven of refug
i drove out to the ranch novemb 24 1902 and found the littl
pond almost black with the bird and wa fortun enough to secur
a pictur of a part of the pond while the duck were thickli
gather thereon ic had form around the edg and thi ic wa
cover with duck the water wa also aliv with other which paid
not the least attent to the parti of stranger on the shore
from mr grai i learn that there were some 600 duck of variou
kind on the pond at that time though it wa then earli for them to
seek winter quarter later in the year he assur me there would
be between 2000 and 3000 teal mallard canvasback redhead
and other varieti all perfectli at home and fearless of danger
the famili have habitu approach the pond from the hous which
stand on the south side and should ani person appear on the north
side of the pond the duck immedi take fright and flight wheat
wa strewn on the ground and in the water and the duck waddl
around us within a few inch of our feet to feed pai not the
least attent to us or to the old housedog which walk near
six mile east of the ranch is san lui lake to which these duck
travel almost daili while the lake is open when thei ar at the
lake it is imposs to approach within gunshot of the then timid
bird some unsympathet boi and men have learn the habit of the
bird and place themselv in hide along the cours of flight to

account accompani by mani beauti photograph of egret breed in
sanctuari on of which appear on page 27
in some recent public i have seen statement to the effect
that you believ the egret were near extinct ow to the
persecut of plume hunter so i know that you will be interest
in the enclos photograph which were taken in my heron rookeri
situat within 100 yard of my factori where i am now sit
dictat thi letter
thi rookeri wa start by me in 1896 becaus i saw at that time
that the heron of louisiana were be rapidli extermin by
plume hunter my thought wa that the wai to preserv them would be
to start an artifici rookeri of them where thei could be
thoroughli protect with thi end in view i built a small pond
take in a wet space that contain a few willow and other shrub
which grow in wet place
in a larg cage in thi pond i rais some snowi heron after
keep the bird in confin for someth over six month i
turn them loos hope that thei would come back the next season
as thei were perfectli tame and were us to see peopl i wa
reward the next season by four of the bird return and nest
in the willow in the pond thi wa the start of a rookeri that now
cover 35 acr and contain more than twenti thousand pair of
nest bird embrac not onli the egret but all the speci of
heron found in louisiana besid mani other water bird
with a view to carri on the preserv of our bird on a larger
scale mr cha w ward and i have recent donat to the state of
louisiana 13000 acr of what i consid to be the finest wild fowl
feed ground on the louisiana coast as it contain the onli
gravel beach for 50 mile and all of the gees within that space
come daili to thi beach for gravel thi territori also produc a
great amount of natur food for gees and duck
save the gull and ternsbut for the vigor and longcontinu
effort of the audubon societi i think our coast would by thi time
have been swept clean of the gull and tern that now adorn it twenti
year ago the millin were determin to have them all the fight for
them wa long and hotli contest but the audubon societi won it
wa a great victori and ha yield result of great valu to the
countri at larg and yet it wa onli a small number of person who
furnish the monei and made the fight which inur to the benefit of
the million of american peopl hereaft whenev you see an american
gull or tern remind yourself that it wa save to the nation by the
audubon peopl
in time of grave emerg such as fire war and scarciti of food the
wild creatur forget their fear of man and mani time actual
surrend themselv to hi merci and protect at such time hard is
the heart and low is the code of manli honor that doe not respond in a
manner becom a superior speci
the most pathet wildanim situat ever seen in the unit state
on a larg scale is that which for six winter in success forc
sever thousand starv elk into the settlement of jackson hole
wyom in quest of food at the hand of their natur enemi the elk
lost all fear partli becaus thei were not attack and thei
surround the logenclos haystack barn and hous mute beg
for food previou to the winter of 1911 thousand of weak calv and
cow perish around the haystack mr sn leek wonder pictur
tell a thrill but veri sad stori
to the everlast honor of the peopl of jackson hole be it record
that thei rose like men to the occas that confront them in 1909
thei gave to the elk herd all the hai that their domest stock could
spare not paus to ascertain whether thei ever would be reimburs
for it thei just hand it out the famish anim liter mob
the haywagon todai the nation govern ha the situat in

in time of peac and plenti the peopl of jackson hole take their toll
of the elk herd but their exampl dure starvat period is to be
commend to all men
a slaughter of restor gameth case of the chamoi in switzerland
teach the world a valuabl lesson in how not to slaughter game that
ha come back to it haunt through protect breed
a few year ago on of the provinc of switzerland took note of the
fact that it onceabund stock of chamoi wa almost extinct and
enact a law by which the remnant wa absolut protect for a long
period dure those year of protect the anim bred and
multipli until final the origin number wa almost restor
thena alwai in such casesther aros a strong demand for an open
season and eventu the govern yield to the pressur of the
hunter and fix a date whereon an open season should begin
illustr gull and tern of our coast save from destruct
these bird have been save and brought back to us by the splendid effort
of the audubon societi and other birdlov but for the antiplumag
law not on gull or tern would now remain on our atlant coast
from the american natur histori
dure the period preced that fatal date the live chamoi grown
half tame by year of immun from the gun were all carefulli locat
and mark down by those who intend to hunt them at daybreak on the
fatal dai the onset began gun and hunter were everywher and the
mountain resound with the fusillad hundr of chamoi were slain
by hundr of hunter and by the close of that fatal open season the
speci wa more nearli extermin throughout that region than ever
befor onc more those mountain were nice and barren of game
let that bloodi and disgrac episod serv as a warn to american
who ar tempt to demand an open season on game that ha bred back from
the verg of extinct particularli do we commend it to the notic of
the peopl of colorado who even now ar demand an open season on
the preserv mountain sheep of that state the grant of such an open
season would be a brutal outrag those sheep ar now so tame and
unsuspici that the kill of them would be coldblood murder
the logic conclusionwithin reason limit ani partlydestroi
wild speci can be increas and brought back by give absolut
protect from harass and slaughter when a speci is struggl
to recuper it deserv to be left entir unmolest until it is
onc more on safe ground
everi breed wild anim crave seclus and entir immun from
excit and all form of molest natur simpli demand thi as
her unassail right it is my firm belief that ani wild speci will
breed in captiv whenev it member ar given a degre of seclus
that thei deem satisfactori
with speci that have not been shot down to a point entir too low
adequ protect gener long in durat will bring back their
number if the peopl of the unit state so will it we could have
wild whitetail deer in everi state and in everi counti save citi
counti between the atlant and the rocki mountain we could easili
have on thousand bob white quail for everi on now live we could
have squirrel in everi grove and songbird by the millionmer by
protect them from slaughter and molest from ohio to the great
plain the pinnat grous could be made far more common than crow and
blackbird
inasmuch as all thi is trueand no on with inform will disput
it for a momenti it not folli to seek to supplant our own splendid
nativ speci of game bird that we never yet have decent
protect with foreign speci let the american peopl answer thi
question with ye or no
the method by which our nongam bird can be encourag and brought
back ar veri simpl protect them put up shelter for them give them
nestbox in abund protect them from cat dog and all other
form of destruct and feed those that need to be fed i should think
that everi boi live in the countri would find keen pleasur in make
and erect nestbox for martin wren and squirrel in put up
straw teepe in winter for the quail in feed the quail and in
nail to the tree chunk of suet and fat pork everi winter for the
woodpeck nuthatch and other winter resid
will ani person now on thi earth live long enough to see the present
allpervad and devilish spirit of slaughter so replac by the love
of wild creatur and the true spirit of conserv that it will be as
rare as it now is common
but let no on think for a moment that ani vanish speci can at ani
time be brought back for that would be a grave error the point is
alwai reach by everi such speci that the survivor ar too few to
cope with circumst and recoveri is imposs the heath hen could
not be brought back neither could the passeng pigeon the whoop
crane the sage grous the trumpet swan the wild turkei and the
upland plover never will come back to us and noth that we can do
ever will bring them back circumst ar against those speciesand
i fear against mani other also thank to the fact that the american
bison breed well in captiv we have save that speci from complet
extinct but our antelop seem to be doom
it is becaus of the alarm condit of our best wild life that quick
action and strong action is vital necessari we ar sleep on our
possibl

introduc speci that have been benefici
man ha made numer experi in the transplant of wild speci
of mammal and bird from on countri or contin to anoth about
onehalf these effort have been benefici and the other half have
result disastr
the transplant of ani wildanim speci is a leap in the dark on
gener principl it is danger to meddl with the law of natur
and attempt to improv upon the code of the wilder our best wisdom
in such matter mai easili prove to be shortsight folli the troubl
li in the fact that concern transplant it is imposs for
us to know beforehand all the condit that will affect it or that it
will effect and how it will work out in it own home a speci mai
seem not onli harmless but actual benefici to man we do not
know and we can not know all the influenc that keep it in check
and that mould it charact we do not know and we can not know
without a trial how new environ will affect it and what new trait
of charact it will develop under radic differ condit the
gentl dove of europ mai becom the tyrant dove of cathai the
repress rabbit of the old world becom in australia the
uncontrol rabbit a devast and a pest of pest
no wild speci should be transplant and set free in a wild state to
stock new region without consult men of wisdom and follow their
advic it is now against the law of the unit state to introduc and
acclimat in a wild state anywher in the unit state ani
wildbird speci without the approv of the depart of agricultur
the law is a wise on furthermor the same principl should appli to
bird that it is propos to transplant from on portion of the unit
state into anoth especi when the two ar wide separ
on thi point i onc learn a valuabl lesson which mai well point my
present moral incident also it wa a narrow escap for me
a gentlemen of my acquaint who admir the european magpi and is
well awar of it accept resid in variou countri in europ
onc request my cooper in secur and acclimat at hi
countri estat a number of bird of that speci as in duti bound i
laid the matter befor our depart of agricultur and ask for an
opinion the depart repli in effect why import a foreign magpi
when we have in the west a speci of our own quit as handsom and
which could more easili be transplant
the point seem well taken now i had seen much of the american
magpi in it wild hometh rocki mountain and the western border
of the great plainsand i thought i wa acquaint with it i knew
that a few complaint against it had been made but thei had seem to
me veri trivial to me our magpi seem to have a gener
unobjection record
fortun for me i wrote to mr hershei assist curat of
ornitholog in the colorado state museum for assist in procur
fifti bird for transplant to the state of new york mr hershei
repli that if i realli wish the bird for acclimat he would
gladli procur them for me but he said that in the thicklysettl
farm commun of colorado the magpi is now regard as a pest
it devour the egg and nestl of other wild bird and not onli
that it destroi so mani egg of domest poultri that mani farmer ar
compel to keep their egglai hen shut up in wire enclosur
now thi condit happen to be entir unknown to me becaus i
never had seen the american magpi in action in a farm commun
of cours the propos experi wa promptli abandon but it is
embarrass to think how near i came to make a mistak even if the
magpi had been transplant and had becom a nuisanc in thi state
thei could easili have been extermin by shoot but the memori of
the error would have been humili to the parti of the first part
the old world pheasant in americain 1881 the first chines
ringneck pheasant were introduc into the unit state twelv
mile below portland oregon twelv male and three femal the next
year oregon gave pheasant a fiveyear close season a littl later
the golden and silver pheasant of china were introduc and all three
speci throve mightili on the pacif coast in oregon washington and
western british columbia in 1900 the sportsmen of portland and
vancouv were shoot cock golden pheasant accord to law
the success of chines and japanes pheasant on the pacif coast soon
led to experi in the more progress state at state expens
state pheasant hatcheri have been establish in massachusett
connecticut new york new jersei ohio illinoi missouri iowa and
california
in mani local the oldworld pheasant have come to stai the rise
and progress of the ringneck in western new york ha alreadi been
note it came about mere through protect that protect wa
protect in fact not the fals protect that shoot on the sly
it is the ironi of fate that full protect should be accord a
foreign bird in order that it mai multipli and possess the land while
the same kind of protect is refus the nativ bob white and it is
now almost a dead speci so far as thi state is concern
in look about for grievanc against the ringneck and english
pheasant some person have claim that in winter these bird ar
budder which mean that thei harmfulli strip tree and bush of the
bud that those bush will sure need in their spring open on
that point dr joseph kalbfu secretari of the pennsylvania game
commiss sent out a circular letter of inquiri in respons to which
he receiv mani statement with but on except all the testimoni
receiv wa to the effect that pheasant ar not budeat and that

the introduct of oldworld pheasant and the attempt introduct
of the hungarian partridg ar effort design first of all to furnish
sportsmen someth to shoot and incident to provid a new food
suppli for the tabl the peopl of thi countri ar not starv nor
ar thei even veri hungri for the meat of strang bird but as a
foodproduc the pheasant is all right
it disgust me to the core howev to see state that wantonli and
wickedli through sheer apathi and lack of busi enterpris have
allow the quail the heath hen the pinnat grous and the ruf
grous to becom almost extermin by extravag and foolish
shooter now put forth wonderfulli dilig effort and spend
monei without end in introduc foreign speci mani men actual
take the ground that our game cant live in it own countri ani
longer but onli the ignor and the unthink will sai so give our
game bird decent sensibl actual protect stop their be
slaughter far faster than thei breed and thei will live anywher in
their own nativ haunt but where is there on speci of upland
game bird in america that ha been sensibl and adequ protect
from portland main to portland oregon there is not onenot a
singl local in which protect from shoot ha been sensibl or
just or adequ
we have univers given our american upland game bird an unfair deal
and now we ar ad insult to slaughter by bring in foreign game
bird to replac thembecaus our bird cant live befor five
million shotgun
our american game bird can live anywher in the haunt where natur
place them that ar not todai actual occupi by citi and town
give me the make of the law and i will make the prairi chicken and
quail as numer throughout the northern state east of the great
plain as domest chicken ar outsid the regular poultri farm there
is onli on reason why there ar not ten million quail in the state of
new york todayon for each human inhabitantand that reason is the
infern greed and selfish of the men who have almost extermin
our quail by overshoot dont talk to me about the hard winter
kill off our quail it is the hard cheek of the men who shoot them
when thei ought to let them alon
the state of iowa could support 500000 prairi chicken and never miss
the wast grain that thei would glean in the field but now the prairi
chicken is practic extinct in iowa onli a few scatter specimen
remain as last survivor in some of the northern counti the
migrat of those bird that unexpectedli came down from the north last
winter wa like the fall of a meteoronli the bird promptli fade
awai again why should new york new jersei and massachusett
extermin the heath hen and coddl the ringneck pheasant and the
hungarian partridg
the introduct of the oldworld pheasant interest me veri littl
everi on that i see is a pain remind of our slaughter quail and
grouseth bird that never have had a squar deal from the american
peopl thu far the introduct of the hungarian partridg ha not
been success anywher connecticut missouri new jersei and i think
other state have tri thi and fail the failur of that speci
bring no sorrow to me i prefer our own game bird and if the american
peopl will not conserv those properli and decent thei deserv to
have no game bird
the european red deer in new zealandoccasion a gameless land
make a tenstrik by introduc a foreign game anim that doe no
harm and becom of great valu the greatest success ever made in the
transplant of game anim ha been in new zealand
origin new zealand possess no larg anim and no biggam
when natur pass around the deer antelop sheep goat wild cattl

in 1864 the princ consort of england caus seven head of european red
deer to be taken from the royal park at windsor and sent to
christchurch new zealand onli three of the anim surviv the long
voyag a buck and two doe for sever week the two were kept in a
barn in christchurch where thei serv no good purpos and were not
like to live long or be happi final some on said let set them
free in the mountain
the idea wa adopt the three anim were haul an uncertain number
of mile into the interior mountain and set free
thei promptli settl down in their new home thei began to breed and
now on the north island there ar probabl five thousand european red
deer everi on of which ha descend directli from the famou three
and here is the strangest part of the stori
the red deer of the north island repres the greatest case of

of new zealand ar todai physic larger and more robust anim
with longer and heavier antler and longer hair than ani of the red

red deer have been introduc practic all over new zealand and the
total number now in the island must be somewher near forti thousand
the sportsmen of that countri have grand sport and take mani splendid

littl game in sight the vast major belong in the next chapter we
will ventur to mention the bob white quail that were introduc into
utah in 1871 into idaho in 1875 and the california vallei quail in
washington in 1857 wherev these effort have succeed the result
have been benefici to man
in 1879 a wellorgan effort wa made to introduc european quail
into sever of the new england and middl statesto take the place of
the bob white we mai supposeth bird that cant stand the winter
about three thousand bird were distribut and set freeand went down
and out just as might have been expect dure the past twenti year
it is safe to sai that not less than 500000 have been expend in the
northern state and particularli in the northeastern state in
import live quail from kansa the indian territori oklahoma texa
the carolina and other southern state for restock area from which
the northern bob white had been extermin by foolish overshoot i
think that fulli ninetenth of these effort have end in total
failur the quail could not surviv in their strang environ i
cannot recal a singl instanc in which restock northern cover
with southern quail ha been a success
there is no royal road to the restor of an extermin bird
speci where the nativ seed still exist by long labor and travail
thorough protect and a mighti long close season it can be encourag
to breed back and return but it is an evolut that can not be
hurri in the least protect natur and leav the rest to her

in the transplant of fish condit ar wide differ and
mani notabl success have been achiev
on of the greatest hit ever made by the unit state bureau of
fisheri in the plant of fish in new local wa the
introduct of the stripe bass or rockfish roccu lineatu of
our atlant coast into the coast water of california in 1879
135 live fish were deposit in karquin strait at martinez and
in 1882 300 more were plant in suisun bai near the first
local chosen
twelv year after the first plant in san francisco bai the
market of san francisco handl 149997 pound of stripe bass at
that time the averag weight for a whole year wa eleven pound and
the averag price wa ten cent per pound fish weigh as high as
fortynin pound have been taken and there ar reason for the
belief that eventu the fish of california will attain as great
weight as those of the atlant and the gulf
the san francisco market now sell annual about on and on half
million pound of stripe bass thi fish ha taken it place among
angler as on of the game fish of the california coast and
afford fine sport strang to sai howev it ha not yet spread
beyond the shore of california
regard thi speci the record of the unit state bureau of
fisheri ar of interest in 1897 the california market handl
2949642 pound worth 225527american natur histori
nowher els in the world we ventur to sai were such extens
costli and persist effort put forth in the transplant of ani
wild foreign speci as the old us fish commiss under prof
spencer f baird put forth in the introduct of the german carp into
the fresh water pond lake and river of the unit state it wa
held that becaus the carp could live and thrive in water bottom with
mud that speci would be a boon to all inland region where bodi of
water or stream were scarc and dear although the carp is not the
best fish in the world for the tabl it seem that the dweller in the
prairi and great plain region would find it far better than
bullhead or no fish at allwhich ar about the same thing
by mean of special fish car sent liter all over the unit
state at a great total expens live carp hatch in the pond near
the washington monument were distribut to all applic the german
carp spread far and wide but todai i think the fish ha about as mani
enemi as friend in some place strong object have been file to
the manner in which carp stir up the mud at the bottom of pond and
small lake greatli to the detriment of all the nativ fish found

state game preserv in the unit state
pennsylvaniath proposit that everi state territori and provinc
in north america and everywher els should establish a seri of state
forest and game preserv is fairli incontest as a busi
proposit it is todai no more a debat question or open to
argument than is the water suppli or sewer system of a citi the onli
perfect wai to conserv a water suppli for a great human popul is
by acquir titl to water shed and either protect the forest
upon them or plant forest in case none exist
in on import matter the state of pennsylvania ha been wide awak
and in advanc of the time i will cite her system of forest reserv
and game preserv as a model plan for other state to follow and i
sincer hope that by the time the member of the present state game
commiss have pass from earth the peopl of pennsylvania will have
learn the valu of the work thei ar now do and at least give them
the appreci that is deserv by publicspirit citizen who do
larg thing for the peopl without hope of materi reward at thi
moment commission john m phillip and dr joseph kalbfu ar put
their heart blood into the busi of preserv and increas the
game and other wild life of pennsylvania and the utter lack of
appreci that is now be shown in some quarter is realli
distress i refer particularli to the utterli misguid and mistaken
bodi of hunter and angler have headquart at harrisburg whose
member ar grossli mislead into a wrong posit by a man who seek to
secur a salari state posit through the hostil organ that
he ha built up appar for hi own us in the belief that those
member gener ar mislead and not meanspirit and that the
organ contain a major of conscienti sportsmen i predict
that er long the evil geniu of pennsylvania game protect will be
order to the rear while the organ as a whole take it place
on the side of the game commiss where it belong
the game sanctuari scheme that pennsylvania ha develop is so new that
as yet onli a veri small fraction of the peopl of that state either
understand it or appreci it farreach import
to begin with pennsylvania ha acquir up to date about on million
acr of forest land scatter through 26 of the 67 counti of the
state these great hold ar to be gradual increas these wild
land includ mani steril mountain farm of no real valu for
agricultur purpos have been acquir first of all for the purpos
of conserv the water suppli of the state and thei ar call the
state forest reserv
next in order the state game commiss ha creat in favor
local in the forest reserv five great game preserv the plan
is decidedli novel and origin but is veri simpl withal in the
center of a great tract of forest reserv a special desir tract
ha been chosen and it boundari mark out by the string of a
singl heavi fenc wire surround the entir select the area
within that boundari wire is an absolut sanctuari for all wild
creatur save those that prei upon game and in it no man mai hunt
anyth nor fire a gun the boundari wire is by no mean a fenc for
it keep noth out nor in
outsid of the wire and the sanctuari men mai hunt in the open season
but at the wire everi chase must end if the hunt deer know enough to
flee to the sanctuari when attack so much the better for the deer
the tide of wild life ebb and flow under the wire and beyond a doubt
the deer and grous will quickli find that within it li absolut
safeti there the breed and rear of young mai go on undisturb
in view of the fact that hunt mai go on in the forest reserv area
surround these sanctuari no intellig sportsman need to be told
that in a few year all such region will be teem with deer grous
and other game where there is on deer todai there will be twenti ten
year hencebecaus the law of pennsylvania forbid the kill of
doe and then there will be twenti time the legitim hunt that
there is todai for exampl the clinton counti game preserv of 3200
acr is surround by 128000 acr of forest reserv which form
legitim hunt ground for the game bred in the sanctuari reservoir
in clearfield counti the game sanctuari is surround by 47000 acr of
forest reserv
the game preserv creat in pennsylvania up to date ar as follow
in clinton counti 3200 acr
in clearfield counti 3200 acr
in franklin counti 3200 acr
in perri counti 3200 acr
in westmoreland counti 2500 acr
it is the deliber intent of the game commiss to increas these
game preserv until there is at least on in each counti
it is the polici of the commiss to clear out of the game sanctuari
all the mammal and bird that destroi wild life such as fox mink
weasel skunk and destruct hawk and owl thi is accomplish
partli by bui old hors kill them in the preserv and poison
them thoroughli with strychnin
each preserv now contain a nucleu herd of whitetail deer some of
them import from northern michigan ruf grous ar breed
rapidli and in the clearfield counti preserv there ar said to be at
least three thousand the game commiss consid it a patriot duti
to preserv the wild turkei ruf grous and quail rather than have
those speci replac at great expens by speci import from the old
world in their work for the protect preserv and increas of
the game of pennsylvaniapartli for the purpos of provid legitim

game preserv and game law in canada
as now set forth on the map of north america canada is a vast countri
we must no longer think of ontario and quebec as canada west and
canada east becaus the new assistantn own and rule
everyth from labrador to british columbia and all the northern
mainland save alaska
although the fauna of canada is strictli boreal it is suffici
dispers and diversifi to demand wise legisl and plenti of it
for a nation with an outfit of provinc so new canada alreadi is well
advanc in the matter of game law and game preserv and in some
respect she ha set the pace for her southern neighbor for exampl
in new brunswick we see the lordli moos successfulli hunt for sport
not onli without be extermin but actual on a basi that permit
it to increas in number in nova scotia we see a law in forc which
successfulli prohibit the wast of moos meat a loss that
character moos hunt everywher els throughout the rang of that
anim all over southern canada the us of automat shotgun in
hunt is strictli prohibit
on the other hand the law of the canadian ar weak in not prevent
the sale of all wild game and the kill of antelop in the matter of
gamesel there ar far too mani open door and a sweep reform
is veri necessari
speak gener and with applic from labrador to british
columbia the american process of game extermin accord to law is
vigor and successfulli be pursu by the peopl of canada the
open season ar too long and the bag limit ar too gener to the
gunner as it is elsewher the baglimit law on bird ar a farc
becaus it is imposs to enforc them save on everi tenth man for

fisheri commiss 1912 commission kelli evan sai
the prairi chicken which formerli wa compar plenti
throughout the greater portion of the raini river district ha now
becom practic extinct in that region variou caus have been
assign for thi but it would seem as usual to have been mainli the
fault of indiscrimin and excess slaughter page 226
like the unit state the variou portion of canada have their
variou local troubl in wildlif protect i think the greatest
practic difficulti and the most real opposit to adequ
measur is found in the provinc of quebec and ontario is it becaus
the frenchdescend popul is impati of real restraint and
object to measur that ar drastic even though thei ar necessari in
ontario commission evan ha been splendidli support by the
govern and by all the real sportsmen of that provinc but the
gunner and guerrilla of destruct have successfulli postpon
sever of the reform that he ha advoc and which should have been
carri into effect
so far as public moral support for game protect is concern i
think that the prairi and mountain provinc have the best of it in
manitoba saskatchewan alberta athabasca and british columbia the
spirit of the peopl is mainli correct and the chief thing that seem
to be lack is a kelli evan in each of those provinc to urg public
sentiment into strong action for exampl why should alberta still
permit the hunt and kill of pronghorn antelop when it is so
well known that that speci is vanish like a mist befor the morn
sun i think it is becaus no on seem to have risen up as go shield
did in the unit state to make a big fuss about it and demand a
reform at ani rate all the provinc of canada that still possess
antelop should immedi pass law give that speci absolut
close season for ten year why neglect it longer when such neglect
is now so veri wrong whether thi is done or not i sincer hope that
hereaft no true american sportsman will be guilti of kill on of
the vanish antelop of canada even though the law doth give it
the game preserv of canada
in the creation of nation park and game preserv some of the
provinc of the canadian nation have displai a degre of foresight
and enterpris that merit sincer admir while in differ
provinc the exact statu of these establish mai vari somewhat
the main purpos of each is the sameth preserv of the forest
and the wild life in all of them a regul amount of fish is
permit and in some the take of furbear anim is permit
but i believ in all the bird and furless mammal ar strictli
protect in some park the carri of firearm still is permit
but that privileg is quit out of harmoni with the spirit and purpos
of a game preserv and should be abolish if it is necessari to carri
firearm through a preserv as often happen in the yellowston park
it can be done under seal that ar affix by duli appoint offic
and thu will temptat be kept out of the wai of sinner
up to thi date i never have seen a public which set forth in on
place even so much as an annot list of the game preserv of the
variou provinc of canada and at present exact inform regard
them is rather difficult to obtain it seem that an adequ
government public on thi subject is now due and overdu
ontarioat the present time sai commission evan in hi final
report the algonquin nation park is the onli actual game preserv
in the provinc be in fact a game reserv and not a forest reserv
but in the past at least a measur of protect would seem to have been
afford the game in most of the forest reserv ow to the fact
that the carri of firearm therein ha been discourag and it would
appear to requir but the pass of an orderincouncil to render the
carri of firearm in all reserv illeg it is sincer to be
hope that not onli will such action be taken without delai but also
that all the forest reserv will be declar game reserv in the
strictest sens
to thi sentiment all friend of wild life will join a fervent wish for
it realiz as condit ar todai it is imposs to have too
mani game reserv there is everyth to gain and noth to lose by
make everi nation forest and forest reserv on the whole contin
of north america a game preserv in the strictest sens and we hope to
live to see that end accomplish both in the unit state and canada

privat game preserv
primarili in the earli dai of the manonhorseback the selfelect
and predatori lord of creation evolv the privat game preserv as a
scheme for prevent other fellow from shoot and for keep the
game sacr to slaughter by themselv the idea of conserv the game
wa a fourthrat consider the first be the estoppel of the
other man the oldworld owner of a game preserv delight in the annual
kill of the surplu game and we have even heard it whisper that in
the dark ag there were king who enjoi the wholesal slaughter of
deer wild boar pheasant and grous if we mai accept as true the
histori of sport in europ there have been men who have love slaughter
with a genuin bloodlust that is quit foreign to the real
naturelov sportsman

fever for privat game preserv some of those alreadi exist ar of
fine proport and cost fortun to creat everi true sportsman who
is rich enough to own a privat game preserv sooner or later acquir
on you will find them scatter throughout the temper zone of north
america from the bai of fundi to san diego i have had invit to
visit preserv in an unbroken chain from the farthest corner of quebec
to the pacif coast and from grand island lake superior to the gulf
of mexico it wa not necessarili to hunt and kill someth but to
see the game and the beauti of natur
the wealthi american and canadian joyous bui a tract of wilder
fenc it stock it with game both great and small and provid game
keeper for all the year round at first he ha an idea that he will
hunt therein and that hi guest will hunt also and actual kill
game in a mild wai thi fiction sometim is maintain for year the
owner mai each year shoot two or three head of hi surplu big game and
hi tenderfoot guest who dont know what real hunt is mai also kill
someth each year but in most of the american preserv with which i
am well acquaint the gentlemanli sport of hunt big game is
almost a joke the troubl is usual the owner becom so attach to
hi big game and admir it so sincer he ha not the heart to kill
it himself and he find no joi whatev in see it shot down by
other
in thi countri the slaughter of game for the market is not consid a
gentlemanli pastim even though there is a surplu of preservebr
game that must be reduc to the averag american the slaughter of
halftam elk deer and bird that have been bred in a preserv doe not
appeal in the least he know that in the protect of a preserv the
wild creatur lose much of their fear of man and becom easi mark
and shall a real sportsman go out with a gun and a bushel of cartridg
on a poni and without warn betrai the confid of the wild in
term of fire and blood other mai do it if thei like but as a rule
that is not what an american call sport on wideawak and
wellarm grizzli bear or mountain sheep outwit on a mountainsid

the valu of such shoot as a real sportsman proposit in the

the shoot of driven game is mere a question of marksmanship and
is after all more in the natur of a shoot exercis than sport
i have seen some shoot in preserv that wa too tame to be call
sport but on the other hand i can testifi that in grous shoot as it
is done behind the dog on mr carnegi moor at skibo it is sport in
which the hunter earn everi grous that fall to hi gun at the same
time also i believ that the shoot of madli run ibex as it is
done by the king of itali in hi three mountain preserv is
suffici difficult to put the best biggam hunter to the test
there ar time when shoot driven game call for far more dexter

breed game and fur in captiv
game breedingth breed of game in captiv for sale in the
market of the world is just as legitim as the breed of domest
speci thi appli equal to mammal bird reptil and fish it
is the duti of the nation and the state to foster such industri and
facilit the market of their product without ani unnecessari
formal delai or loss to produc or to purchas
alreadi thi principl ha been establish in sever state without
go into the record it is safe to sai that colorado wa the pioneer
in the socal moregam movement about 1899 but there is on
person who would like to have the world believ that it start in the
state of new york about 1909 the idea is not quit as old as the
hill but the applic of it in the unit state date back
through a consider vista of year
the law of colorado provid for the creation of privat game
preserv and the market of their product under a tag system ar
veri elabor and thei show a sincer desir to foster an industri as
yet but slightli develop in thi countri the law of new york ar
much more simpl and easi to understand than those of colorado
there is on import principl now fulli recogn in the new york
law for game breed that other state will do well to adopt it is
the fact that certain kind of wild game can not be bred and rear in
captiv on a commerci basi and thi be true it is clearli
against public polici to provid for the sale of ani such speci why
provid for the sale of preservebr grous and duck which we know can
not be bred and rear in confin in market number for
exampl if we mai judg by the numer experi that thu far
have been madea we certainli have a right to dono man can
successfulli breed and rear in captiv on a commerci basi the
canvasback duck teal pintail duck ruf grous or quail thi be
the case no amount of clamor from game dealer and their alli ever
should induc ani state legislatur to provid for the sale of ani of
those speci until it ha been fulli demonstr that thei have
been and can be bred in captiv in larg number the moment the
market of a state ar thrown open to these imposs speci from
that moment the state game warden must make a continu struggl to
prevent the import and sale of those bird contrari to law thi
proposit is so simpl that everi honest man can see it
all that ani state legislatur mai rightfulli be ask to do is to
provid for the sale under tag of those speci which we know can
be bred in captiv in larg number
when the bayn law wa draft it author consid with the utmost
care the possibl in the breed of game in the unit state on a
commerci basi it wa found that as yet onli two wild nativ speci
have been and can be rear in captiv on a larg scale these ar
the whitetail deer and mallard duck of foreign speci we can breed
successfulli for market the fallow deer red deer of europ and some of
the pheasant of the old world for the rear kill and market
of all these the bayn law provid the simplest process of state
supervis that the best game protector and game breeder of new york
could devis the tag system is expediti cheap and effect
practic the onli real concess that is requir of the
gamebreed concern the kill which must be done in a systemat
wai wherebi a state game warden can visit the breeder premis and
affix the tag without ani seriou sacrific of time or conveni on
either side the tag cost the breeder five cent each and thei pai the
cost of the servic render by the state
by thi admir system which is veri plainli set forth in the new
york conserv commiss book of game law all the wild game of
new york and of everi other state is absolut protect at all
time against illeg kill and illeg import for the new york
market now is it not the duti of connecticut maryland virginia the
carolina and everi other state to return our compliment by pass
similar law massachusett came up to public expect at the next
session of her legislatur after the passag of our bayn law in 1913
california will try to secur a similar act and we know full well that
her duck gees quail grous and bandtail pigeon need it veri
much if the california protector of wild life succe in arous the
great quiet mass of peopl in that state their bayn bill will be swept
through their legislatur on a tidal wave of popular sentiment
elkfor peopl who own wild woodland near larg citi there ar
good profit to be made in rear whitetail deer for the market i
would also mention elk but for the fact that everi man who rear a fine
herd of elk quickli becom so proud of the anim and so much
attach to them that he can not bear to have them shot and butcher
for market elk ar just as easi to breed and rear as domest cattl
except that in the fall breed season the fight of rival bull
demand care and intellig manag concern the possibl
of feed elk on hai at 25 per ton and declar an annual profit i
am not inform if the elk requir to be fed all the year round the
high price of hai and grain might easili render it imposs to produc

35 cent per pound on the bill of fare of a first class hotel a

the indian sambar deer look like a shortleg bigbodi understudi
of our american elk it breed well in captiv and it is of quiet

of todai should not take up hi share of the common burden just as
soon as he is old enough to wander alon through the wood let him be

must not shoot songbird woodpeck and kingfish with a

howev there is a screw loos in the system and that is the shortag
in definit posit instruct regard individu duti toward the

school children should be taught in the imper mood
1 that it is wrong to disturb breed bird or rob bird nest
2 that it is wrong to destroi ani harmless live creatur not properli
class as game except it be to preserv it in a museum
3 that it is no longer right for civil man to look upon wild game
as necessari food becaus there is plenti of other food and the
remnant of game can not withstand slaughter in that basi
4 that the time ha come when it is the duti of everi good citizen to

teacher to educ our boi and girl constantli and imper
along those line teacher do not sai to your pupilsit is right

hereaft no zoolog or natur studi text book should be given a

careless of hi duti toward it to be accept as a safe guid for the
young the time for crimin indiffer ha gone by hereaft everi
on who is not for the preserv of wild life is against it and it is
time to separ the sheep from the goat
from thi time forth the preserv of our fauna should be regard
as a subject on which everi candid for a teacher certif should
undergo an examin befor receiv author to teach in a public
school the candid should be requir to know why the preserv
of bird is necessari why the slaughter of wild life is wrong and
crimin the extent to which wild bird and mammal return to us and
thrive under protect why wild game is no longer a legitim food
suppli why wild game should not be sold and why the feather of wild

fruit is not a long berri nor is it of a purpl color but it grow
from bud on the limb and twig someth after the manner of the
pussywillow it is smaller of light color and ha a veri distinct

chapter xlii
the ethic of sportsmanship
i count it as rather strang that american and english sportsmen have
hunt and shot for a centuri and until 1908 formul practic
noth to establish and defin the ethic of shoot game here and
there a few unwritten principl have been evolv and have becom
fix by common consent but the total number of these is veri few
perhap thi ha been for the reason that everi free and independ
sportsman prefer to be a law unto himself is it not doubli strang
howev that even down to the present year the term sportsmen never
ha been defin by a sportsman
forti year ago a sportsman might have been defin accord to the
standard of that period as a man who hunt wild game for pleasur
those were the dai wherein no on foresaw the wholesal annihil of
speci and there were no wilder game preserv in those dai
gentlemen shot femal hoof game trap bear if thei felt like it
kill ten time as much big game as thei could us and no on made ani
fuss whatev about the wast or extermin of wild life
those were the dai of oxteam and broadax todai we ar live in
a total differ worlda world of grind crunch pulver
progress a world of annihil of the work of natur and what is a
sportsman todai
a sportsman is a man who love natur and who in the enjoy of the
outdoor life and explor take a reason toll of natur wild
anim but not for commerci profit and onli so long as hi hunt
doe not promot the extermin of speci
in view of the disappear of wild life all over the habit globe
and the steadi extermin of speci the ethic of sportsmanship ha
becom a matter of tremend import if a man can shoot the last
live burchel zebra or pronghorn antelop and be a sportsman and
a gentleman then we mai just as well drop down all bar and sai no
more about the ethic of shoot game
but the real gentlemensportsmen of the world ar not insens to the
duti of the hour in regard to the take or not take of game the
time ha come when canon law should be laid down of worldwid
applic and so thoroughli accept and promulg that their
bind forc can not be ignor among other thing it is time for a
list of speci to be publish which no man claim to be either a
gentleman or a sportsman can shoot for aught els than preserv in a
public museum of cours thi list would be compos of the speci
that ar threaten with extermin of american anim it should
includ the pronghorn antelop mexican mountain sheep all the
mountain sheep and goat in the unit state the california grizzli
bear mule deer west indian seal and california eleph seal and
walru
in africa that list should includ the eland white rhinocero
blessbok bontebok kudu giraff and southern eleph sabl
antelop rhinocero south of the zambesi leucoryx antelop and
whalehead stork in asia it should includ the great indian
rhinocero and it alli speci the burrhel the nilgiri tahr and the
gayal the david deer of manchuria alreadi is extinct in a wild state
in australia the interdict should includ the thylacin or tasmanian
wolf all the larg kangaroo the emu lyre bird and the malleebird
think what it would mean to the speci name abov if all the sportsmen
of the world would unit in their defens both activ and passiv
it would be to those speci a modu vivendi worth while
prior to 1908 no effort so far as we ar awar ever had been made to
promot the establish of a comprehens and uptod code of
ethic for sportsmen who shoot a few club of men who ar hunter of
big game had express in their constitut a few brief principl for
the purpos of standard their own respect membership but that
wa all i have not taken pain to make a gener canvass of sportsmen
club to ascertain what rule have been laid down by ani larg number of
organ
the boon and crockett club of new york and washington had in it
constitut the follow excel articl
articl x the us of steel trap the make of larg bag the
kill of game while swim in water or helpless in deep snow and
the unnecessari kill of femal or young of ani speci of rumin
shall be deem offens ani member who shall commit such offens mai
be suspend or expel from the club by unanim vote of the
execut committe
in 1906 thi club condemn the us of automat shotgun in hunt as
unsportsmanlik
the lewi and clark club of pittsburgh ha in it constitut as
section 3 of articl 3 the follow comprehens principl
the term legitim sport mean not onli the observ of local

stalk or still hunt
at the end of the constitut of thi club is thi declar and
admonit
purchas and sale of trophiesa the purchas of head and horn
establish a market valu and encourag indian and other to shoot
for sale often in violat of local law and alwai to the detriment
of the protect of game for legitim sport the lewi and clark club
condemn the purchas or the sale of the head or horn of ani game
in 1906 the lewi and clark club condemn the us of automat
shotgun as unsportsmanlik
the shikar club of london a club which contain all the biggam
hunter of the nobil and gentri of englandq and of which hi
majesti king georg is honorari presid ha declar the lead
featur of it object in the follow term
to maintain the standard of sportsmanship it is not squander bullet
and swollen bag which appeal to us the test is rather in a love of
forest mountain and desert in acquir knowledg of the habit of
anim in the strenuou pursuit of a wari and danger quarri in the
instinct for a welldevis approach to a fair shoot distanc and in
the patient retriev of a wound anim
footnot q thi organ contain in it list of member the most
distinguish name in the modern annal of british sport and
explor it honorari membership of eight person contain the
name of three american theodor roosevelt madison grant and wt
hornadai and of thi fact at least on person is extrem proud
in 1908 the campfir club of america formal adopt as it code of
ethic the sportsman platform of fifteen articl that wa prepar
by the writer and place befor the sportsmen of america great britain
and her coloni depend in that year in the book of the club it
regularli appear as follow
code of ethic
of the
campfir club of america
propos by wm t hornadai and adopt decemb 10 1908
1 the wild anim life of todai is not our to do with as we
pleas the origin stock is given to us in trust for the
benefit both of the present and the futur we must render an
account of thi trust to those who come after us
2 judg from the rate at which the wild creatur of north
america ar now be destroi fifti year henc there will be no
larg game left in the unit state nor in canada outsid of
rigidli protect game preserv it is therefor the duti of everi
good citizen to promot the protect of forest and wild life and
the creation of game preserv while a suppli of game remain
everi man who find pleasur in hunt or fish should be will
to spend both time and monei in activ work for the protect of
forest fish and game
3 the sale of game is incompat with the perpetu preserv
of a proper stock of game therefor it should be prohibit by law
and by public sentiment
4 in the settl and civil region of north america there is no
real necess for the consumpt of wild game as human food nor
is there ani good excus for the sale of game for food purpos the
mainten of hire labor on wild game should be prohibit
everywher under sever penalti
5 an indian ha no more right to kill wild game or to subsist upon
it all the year round than ani white man in the same local the
indian ha no inher or godgiven ownership of the game of north
america anymor than of it miner resourc and he should be
govern by the same game law as white men
6 no man can be a good citizen and also be a slaughter of game or
fish beyond the narrow limit compat with highclass
sportsmanship
7 a gamebutch or a markethunt is an undesir citizen and
should be treat as such
8 the highest purpos which the kill of wild game and game
fish can hereaft be made to serv is in furnish object to
overwork men for tramp and camp trip in the wild and the
valu of wild game as human food should no longer be regard as an
import factor in it pursuit
9 if rightli conserv wild game constitut a valuabl asset to
ani countri which possess it and it is good statesmanship to
protect it
10 an ideal hunt trip consist of a good comrad fine countri
and a veri few trophi per hunter
11 in an ideal hunt trip the death of the game is onli an
incid and by no mean is it realli necessari to a success
out
12 the best hunter is the man who find the most game kill the
least and leav behind him no wound anim
13 the kill of an anim mean the end of it most interest
period when the countri is fine pursuit is more interest than
possess
14 the kill of a femal hoof anim save for special
preserv is to be regard as incompat with the highest
sportsmanship and it should everywher be prohibit by stringent
law
15 a particularli fine photograph of a larg wild anim in it
haunt is entitl to more credit than the dead trophi of a similar
anim an anim that ha been photograph never should be kill
unless previous wound in the chase
thi platform ha been adopt as a code of ethic by the follow
organ besid the campfir club of america
the lewi and clark club of pittsburgh john m phillip presid
the north american fish and game protect associ intern
massachusett fish and game protect associ boston
campfir club of michigan detroit
rod and gun club sheridan counti wyom
the platform ha been endors and publish by the societi for the
preserv of the wild fauna of the british empir london which is
an endors of farreach import
major j stevensonhamilton cmz warden of the govern game
reserv of the transvaal south africa ha adopt the platform and
given it the most effect endors that it ha receiv from ani
singl individu in hi great work on game protect in africa and
wildanim lore entitl anim life in africa and veri highli
commend by the committe on literari honor of the campfir club
he publish the entir platform with a depth and cordial of
endors that is bound to warm the heart of everi man who believ in
the principl laid down in that document he sai it should be
print on the back of everi licens that is issu for hunt in
africa
i am profoundli impress by the fact that it is high time for sportsmen
all over the world to take to heart the vital necess of adopt high
and clearli defin code of ethic to suit the need of the present
hour the dai of game abund and the careless treatment of wild
life have gone by never to return
chapter xliii
the duti of american zoologist and educ to american wild life
the public of thi chapter will hardli be regard as a bid for
fame or even popular on the part of the author howev the
subject can not be ignor simpli becaus it is disagre
throughout sixti year to go no further back the peopl of america
have been wit the strang spectacl of american zoologist as a
mass so intent upon the academ studi of our continent fauna that
thei seem not to have care a continent about the destruct of that
fauna
dure that tragic period twelv speci of north american bird have
been total extermin twentythre ar almost extermin and the
mammal have fare veri badli
if by their work ye shall know them then no man can sai that the men
refer to have been conspicu on the fire line in defens of
assault wild life in their heart we know that in an academ wai
the naturalist of america do care about wildlif slaughter and the
extermin of speci and we also know that perhap fifti american
zoologist have at time taken an activ and seriou interest in
protect work
i am speak now of the gener bodi of museum director and curat
professor and teacher of zoologi in our institut of learninga
legion in themselv teacher of natur studi in our secondari school
investig and specialist in state and govern servic the
taxidermist and osteologist and the arrai of literari peopl who
like all the forego make their bread and butter out of the
exploit of wild life
taken as a whole the peopl name abov constitut a grand armi of at
least five thousand train educ resourc and influenti
person thei all depend upon wild life for their livelihood when
thei talk about live thing the public listen with respect
attent their knowledg of the valu of wild life would be worth
someth to our caus but thu far it never ha been capit
these peopl ar hard worker and when thei mark out definit cours
and attain goal thei know how to get result yet what do we see
for sixti long year with the except of the work of a corpor
guard of their number thi grand armi ha remain in camp partli
neglect and partli refus to move upon the work of the enemi for
sixti year with the except of the nongamebird law as a class and
a mass thei have left to the sportsmen of the countri the dictat of
law for the protect of all the game bird the mammal and the game
fish when we stop to consid that the game bird alon embrac 154
veri import speci the appal extent to which the zoologist ha
abdic in favor of the sportsman becom appar
it is a veri great mistak and a wrong besid for the zoologist of
the countri to abandon the game bird mammal and fish of north
america to the sportsmen to do with as thei pleas yet that is
practic what ha been done
the time wa thirti or forti year ago when wild life wa so abund
that we did not need to worri about it preserv that wa the
golden era of studi and investig that era end definit in
1884 with the practic extermin of the wild american bison
partli through the shame greed and partli through the neglect of the
american peopl we ar now live in the middl of the period of
extermin the question for everi american zoologist and everi
sportsman to answer now ar shall the slaughter of speci go on to a
quick end of the period shall we give poster a birdless gameless
fishless contin or not shall we have close season all over the
countri for five or ten year or for five hundr year
if we ar courag we will brace up and answer these question now
like men if we ar faintheart and eager for peac at ani price
then we will sidestep the ugli situat until the destroy have
settl it for us by the wholesal extermin of speci
if the zoologist care to know then i will tell him that todai the
wild life of the world can be save by law but not by sentiment
alon you cannot educ a poacher a gamehog a marketgunn a
millin or a vain and foolish woman of fashion all these must be
curb and control by law game refug alon will not save the
wild life all speci of bird mammal and game fish of north

fight for the helpless creatur that must be protect by man or
perish if yale is will to set a new pace for the world great
univers she ha the man readi at hand
the univers of chicago should becom the center of a great new
protectionist movement which should cover the whole middl west area
from the plain to pittsburgh thi is the inflex logic necess
of the hour either protect zoologi or els for veri shame give up
teach it
everi higher institut of learn in america now ha a duti in thi
matter time have chang thing ar not as thei were thirti year
ago to allow a great and valuabl wild fauna to be destroi and wast
is a crime against both the present and the futur if we mean to be
good citizen we cannot shirk the duti to conserv we ar truste of
the inherit of futur gener and we have no right to squander
that inherit if we fail of our plain duti the scorn of futur
gener sure will be our portion
chapter xliv
the greatest need of the wildlif caus and the duti of the hour
the fate of wild life in north america hang todai by three veri
slender thread the name of which you will hardli guess unaid thei
ar labor monei and public the thread ar slender becaus there is
so littl raw materi in them
we do not need monei with which to bui vote or influenc but monei
with which to pai worker to publish thing to arous the american
peopl to sting sportsmen into action to hire warden to prosecut
gamehog and bui refug for wild life if a suffici amount of monei
for these purpos cannot be procur then as sure as the earth
continu to revolv our wild life will pass awai forev
thi is no caus for surpris or wonder in thi twentieth centuri
monei is essenti to everi great enterpris whether it be for virtu
or mischief the enemi of wild life and the peopl who support them
ar veri power the man whose pocket or whose person privileg is
threaten by new legisl is prompt by busi reason to work
against you and spend monei in protect hi interest
now it happen that the men of ordinari mean who have noth person
at stake in the preserv of wild life save sentiment
consider cannot afford to leav their busi more than three or
four dai each year on protect affair yet mani time servic ar
demand for mani dai or even week togeth in order to accomplish
result bad repeal bill must be fought until thei ar dead and good
protect bill must be support until the breath of life is breath
into them by the execut signatur
with monei in hand good men awai can be found who will work in game
protect for about onehalf what thei would demand in other pursuit
with the men whom you realli desir sentiment is alwai a
control factor it is my inflex rule howev in ask for
servic that men who give valuabl time and strength to the caus
shall not be allow to take their expens monei from their own pocket
soldier on the fire line cannot provid the sinew of war that come
from the paymast chest
campaign of public ar matter of tremend necess and
import but their success promot requir hundr or
possibl thousand of dollar for each state that is cover
i believ that the wealthi men and women of america ar the most liber
giver for the benefit of human that can be found in all the world
new york especi contain a great number of men who year in and year
out work hard for moneyin order to give it awai the depth and breadth
of the philanthrop spirit in new york citi is to me the most
surpris of all the strang impuls that swai the inhabit of that
seeth mass of mix human everi imagin caus for the benefit
of mankindsav oneha receiv and still is receiv million
of gift dollar
some enterpris for the transcend educ of the peopl ar at
thi moment hopelessli wallow in the excess of wealth that ha been
thrust upon them men ar be hire at high salari to help spend
wealth in high higher highest educ and research it is now
fashion to bequeath million to certain caus that do not need them
in the least in educ there is a mad scrambl to educ everi
young man to the topmost notch often far abov hi probabl station in
life and into tast and want far beyond hi power to maintain
in all thi howev there would be no caus for regret if the wild
life of our contin were not in such a grievou state if we felt no
conscienc burden for those who come after us we would not care where
the million go but sinc thing ar as thei ar it is heartbreak
to see the caus of wildlif protect actual starv or at the
best subsist onli on financi husk and crumb while less import
caus liter flounder in surplu wealth
thi regret is intensifi by the knowledg that in no other caus for
the conserv of the resourc most valuabl to mankind will a dollar
go so far or bring back such good result as in the preserv of
wild life the promot of the bayn bill and the enact of the
bayn law is a fair exampl that law is todai on the statut book of
the state of new york becaus fifti men and women promptli subscrib
5000 to a fund form with special refer to the expens of the
campaign for that measur and the uplift of that victori will be felt
for year to come just as it alreadi ha been in massachusett
at on time i wa tempt to show the financi skeleton in the closet
of wildlif protect by insert here a statement of the fund
avail to be expend by all the new york organ dure the
campaign year of 19111912 but i cannot do it the show is too
pain too humili from it our enemi would deriv too much
comfort
even in new york state in view of the great interest at stake the
show is piti but what shall we sai of massachusett
pennsylvania connecticut new jersei and a dozen other state where
the situat is much wors in the winter of 1912 a cry for help came
to us from a neighbor state where a terrif fight wa be made by
the forc of destruct against all reform measur and in behalf of
retrogress on spring shoot the appeal said the situat in our
legislatur is the worst that it ha been in year our enemi ar veri
strong well organ and thei fight us at everi step we have no
fund and we ar expect to make brick without straw is there not
someth that you can do to help us
there wa
onli on week previous a good friend who declin to be name gave
us two thousand dollar of real monei for just such emerg
within thirtysix hour an entir new fight forc had been
organ and equip for servic within on week those
reinforc had made a profound impress on the defens of the
enemi and in the end the great fight wa won of our small campaign
fund it took awai over on thousand dollar but the victori wa worth
it
with monei enougha reason sumth bird of north america and
some of the smallmamm speci also can be save the big game that
is hunt and kill outsid the game preserv and outsid of such
place as new brunswick and the adirondack can not be saveduntil
each speci is given perpetu protect colorado is save a small
remnant of her mountain sheep but montana and wyom ar wast
their becaus thei allow kill and the killer ar ten time too
numer for the sheep thei imagin that by permit onli the kill
of ram thei ar save the speci but that is an absolut fallaci
and soon it will have a fatal end
with an endow fund of 2000000 onli doubl the price of the two
old velasquez paint purchas recent by a gentleman of new york
a veri good remnant of the wild life of north america could be save
but who will give the fund or even a quarter of it
thu far the largest sum ever given in america for the caus of
wildlif protect so far as i know person have been the
follow

in the civil world there ar citizen of mani kind but all of them
can be place in two group 1 those with a sens of duti toward
mankind and who will do their duti as good citizen and 2 those who
from the cradl to the grave meanli and sordidli studi their own selfish
interest who never do aught save in expect of a quick return
benefit and who recogn no such thing as duti toward mankind at
larg
men and women of the first class ar honor in life mourn when dead
and gratefulli rememb by poster thei leav the world better than
thei found it and their live have been success
men and women of the second class ar mere so mani piec of anim
furnitur and when thei pass out the world care no more than when old
chair ar thrown upon the scrapheap
there ar mani men so selfish so ignor and mean of soul that even
out of wellfil purs thei would not give ten dollar to save the
whole bird fauna of north america from annihil to all person of
that brand it is useless to appeal as soon as you find on wast no
time upon him get out of hi neighborhood as quickli as you can and
look for help among real men
the wild life of the world cannot be save by a few person even though
thei work their heart out in the effort the caus need two million
more helper and thei must be sought in group no 1 thei ar live
somewher but the great troubl is to find them befor it is too
late
there ar time and caus in which the good citizen ha no option but
to render servic the most import of such caus ar the relief of
suffer human the conserv of the resourc of natur and the
prevent of vandal if the american nation had refus aid to
stricken san francisco the callou hardhearted of it would have
shock the world if the german armi of 1871 had destroi the art
treasur and the librari of pari it would have set the german
nation back ten centuri into the rank of the lowest barbarian
and yet in america and in the region now be scourg by the
feather trade a wonder fauna is be destroi it took million
of year to develop that marvel arrai of wild life and when gone
it never can be replac yet the armi of destruct is sweep it
awai as joyous as a hire labor cut down a field of corn
that wild life can be save if done it must be done by the men and
women of group no 1 the mean by which it can be save ar monei
labor and public everi man of ordinari mean and intellig can
contribut either monei or labor the men on the fire line must not be
expect to furnish their own food and ammunit the worker must be
provid with the monei that activ campaign work imper demand
those who cannot conveni or successfulli labor should give monei
to thi caus but at the same time everi good citizen should keep in
touch with hi lawmak repres and in time of need ask for
vote for whatev new law ar necessari
with monei enough to arous the american peopl in certain wai the
wild life of north america north of mexico can be save monei can
secur labor and public and the peopl will do the rest for thi
campaign work i want and must have a perman fund of 10000 per
annumcash alwai readi for everi emerg in field work i greatli
need and must have immedi an endow wildlif fund of at
least 100000 and eventu 250000 i can no longer pass the hat
each year thi is need in addit to the sever thousand of
dollar annual be expend by the zoolog societi in thi work
the societi is alreadi do it utmost in wildlif protect just as
it is in sever other field of activ
outsid of new york mani wealthi men will sai let new york do it
that often is the wai when nation campaign is to be done in
nation wildlif protect work new york is todai bear about
ninetenth of the burden it is my belief that in 1912 outsid of new
york citi less than 10000 wa rais and expend in wildlif
protect save by state and nation appropri we know that in
the year mention new york expend 221000 in thi caus all from
privat sourc
in a veri short time i shall call for the 100000 that i now must have
as an endow fund for nationwid work to be place at 512 per
cent interest for the 5500 annual incom that it will yield how much
of thi will come from outsid the state of new york some of it i am
sure will come from massachusett and pennsylvania but will ani of it
come from cleveland cincinnati chicago st loui and san francisco
the duti of the hour
i have now said my sai in behalf of wild life sure the path of duti
toward the remnant of wild life is plain enough will those who read
thi book pass along my messag that the hour for a revolut ha
struck will the million of men command by gener apathi now arous
befor it is too late to act
will the true sportsmen rise up and do their duti brave and
unselfishli
will the peopl with wealth to give awai do their duti toward wild life
and human fairli and gener
will the zoologist awak leav their tabl in their stone palac of
peac and come out to the firinglin
will the lawmak heed the handwrit on the wall and make law that
repres the full discharg of their duti toward wild life and
human
will the editor beat the alarmgong earli and late in season and out
