the artist life
the virtuoso career as it realli is
the father of a young woman who wa prepar to becom a virtuoso onc
appli to a famou music educ for advic regard the futur
career of hi daughter i want her to becom on of the greatest
pianist america ha ever produc he said she ha talent good
health unlimit ambit a good gener educ and she is
industri the educ thought for awhil and then said it is
veri like that your daughter will be success in her chosen field
but the amount of grind studi she will be oblig to undergo to meet
the tower standard of modern pianism is aw to contempl in the
end she will have the flatteri of the multitud and let us hope some
of their dollar as well in return she mai have to sacrific mani of
the comfort and pleasur which women covet the more success she
is the more of a nomad she must becom she will know but few dai for
year when she will not be compel to practic for hour she becom
a kind of chattel of the music public she will be harass by
ignor critic and perhap annoi by unreli manag in return
she ha monei and fame but in fact far less of the great joi and
purpos of life than if she follow the customari domest career with
some splendid man as her husband when i wa younger i us to preach
quit an opposit sermon but the more i see of the hardship of the
artist life the less i think of the dollar and the fame it bring it
is hard enough for a man but it is twice as hard for a woman
golden bait
some cynic ha contend that the muchdespis almighti dollar ha
been the greatest incent to the struggl virtuoso in european music
center although thi mai be true in a number of case it is certainli
unjust in other mani of the virtuoso find travel in america so
distast that notwithstand the huge golden bait the manag have
the greatest difficulti in induc the pianist to come back inde
there ar mani artist of great renown whom the manag would be glad
to coax to our countri but who have withheld tempt offer for year
on of these is moritz moszkowski probabl the most popular of modern
pianofort compos of highclass music grieg when he final
consent to make the voyag to america place hi price at two
thousand five hundr dollar for everi concerta sum which ani manag
would regard prohibit except in the case of on worldfam
pianist grieg intent wa obviou
the inconveni of travel in america have been ridicul
exagger in europ and mani virtuoso dread the thought of an
american trip with the great ocean yawn between the two contin
and redskin savag just beyond new york or certainli not far from
chicago de pachmann detest the ocean and when he come over in hi
favorit month of june he doe not dare return until the follow june
other who have never visit america must get their idea of american
travel from some such account as that of charl dicken in hi
unforgiv american note 1842 in which he said in describ
on of our railroad
there is a great deal of jolt a great deal of nois a
great deal of wall not much window a locomot engin a
shriek and a bell the car ar like shabbi omnibus
hold thirti forti fifti peopl in the centr of the
carriag there is usual a stove fed with charcoal or
anthracit coal which is for the most part red hot it is
insuffer close and you see the hot air flutter
between yourself and ani other object you mai happen to look
at
there could have been but littl improv in our railroad in 1872
when rubinstein came to america for although he accept 40000 for
215 concert dure hi first trip he refus an offer of 125000 for
onli 50 concert when a manag tri to persuad him to return
american railroad now present the acm of comfort conveni and
even luxuri in travel yet the european artist ha difficulti in
adjust himself to journei of thousand of mile crowd in a short
winter season when he ha been accustom to littl trip of a few
hundr kilomet he come to dread the train as we might a prison
van paderewski resort to a privat car but even thi luxuri mode
of travel mai be veri monoton and exhaust
the great distanc must certainli account for some of the evid of
strain which deform the face and exhaust the mind of so mani
virtuoso the travel salesman seem to thrive upon mile of railroad
travel as do the crew of the train but the virtuoso drag from
concert to concert by hi showman grow tiredoh so tire pale wan
listless and indiffer at the begin of the season he is quit
anoth person the magnet that ha done so much to win him fame
shine in hi ey and seem to eman from hi fingertip but the
differ in hi physic be at the end of the season is sicken
like a bedraggl wornout circu come in from the wear and tear of a
hard season he crawl wearili back to new york with a cinematograph
recollect of countless telegraph pole fly past the window
audienc after audienc sleep car bud genius the inevit
recept with their equal inevit chicken salad or lukewarm
oyster and the sweet young thing who like hein mythic tribe
of asra must love or perish some virtuoso have the physic
strength to endur all thi even enjoi it but mani have confess to
me that their american tour have been liter nightmar
on of the greatest pianist wa oblig to stai in new york for a while
befor attempt the voyag homeward at the time he wa so weak from
the rigor of the tour that he could scarc write hi name hi
haggard face suggest the tortur of a torquamada rather than buffalo
kansa citi denver and pittsburgh hi voic wa tire and falter
and hi chief interest wa that of the invalidget home as soon as
possibl to have talk with him upon music at that time would have
been an injustic accordingli i led him awai from the subject and
dwelt upon the woe of hi nativ poland and much to hi surpris
left him without the educ materi of which i had been in quest
he ask the reason and i told him that a music confer at that
time could serv no purpos
as men and women asid from the attain which have made them
illustri virtuoso ar for the most part veri much like ordinari
mortal who have to content themselv at the foot of parnassu it ha
been my privileg to know thirti or more of the most emin artist
and some have becom good person friend it is interest to observ
how sever veri differ type of individu mai succe in win
public favor as virtuoso inde except for the longhair caricatur
which the public accept as the convent virtuoso there is no
virtuoso type here is a busi man here an artist here an
engin here a jurist here an actor here a poet and here a freak
all of them distinguish perform perhap the enthusiast
musiclov will resent the idea of a freak becom famou as a
pianist but i have known no less than three men who could not possibl
be otherwis describ but who have nevertheless made both fame and
fortun as virtuoso
freak pianist
the anthropologist who choos to conduct special investig of
freak can find no more entertain field than that of the remark
freak of the brain shown in the case of some astonish perform
whose intellig and mental capac in other wai ha been
neglig the classic case of blind tom for instanc wa that of a
freak not so veri far remov in kind from the siames twin or gener
tom thumb born a slave in georgia and wholli without what teacher
would term a music educ blind tom amaz mani of the most

difficult composit after hear them plai onli onc i convers
with him a number of year ago in new york onli to find that
intellectu and physic he wa alli to the cretin
blind tom peculiar abil ha led mani hasti comment to conclud
that music is a wholli separ mental faculti to be found particularli
in a more or less shiftless and irrespons class of gift but
intellectu limit human be the few case of men and women
whose music talent seem to eclips their mind so that thei remain in
utter dark to everyth els in life should not be taken as a
basi for judg other artist of real geniu and undisput mental
breadth i have in mind howev the case of on pianist who is veri
wide known and highli laud but who is veri slightli remov from
the class of blind tom a train alienist on acquaint with the
differ between the eccentr which frequent accompani
great and the unconsci physic and psychic evid of idioci
which so clearli agre with the antic of the chimpanze or the droll
capuchin monkei might find in the perform to whom i refer a subject
for some veri interest not to sai startl reflect few have
ever been success in induc thi pianist to talk upon ani other
subject than music for more than a few minut at a time anoth
pianist who wa distinguish as a liszt pupil and who tour america
repeatedli seem to have a hatr for the piano that amount to an
obsess look he exclaim i am it slave it ha sent me round
and round the world night after night year after year it ha curs
me like a wander jew no rest no home no liberti do you wonder
that i drink to forget it
a pathet exampl

unconsci exhibit of hi technic abil that while regrett
would have been of immens interest to psychologist who ar seek to
prove that music depend upon a separ oper of a special
faculti dure hi american tour i call frequent upon thi
virtuoso for the purpos of investig hi method of plai he wa
rare free from the influenc of alcohol for more than a few hour at
a time on morn it wa necessari for me to see him profession
and when i found him at hi hotel he wa in a truli disgrac
condit i rememb that he wa unabl to stand from the fact that he
fell upon me while i wa sit in a morri chair he wa bare abl
to talk and just prior to my leav he insist upon scrawl upon
hi visit card zur freundlichen errinerung auf einen sehr spten

idea of hi whereabout nevertheless he sat at the piano keyboard and
plai tremend difficult composit by liszt and

the keyboard to the other as in the case of the liszt campanella he
never miss a note until he lost hi balanc upon the piano stool and
fell to the floor disgust and pathet as the exhibit wa i
could not help feel that i wa wit a marvel instanc of
automat that wonder power of the mind work through the bodi to

the averag american tire busi man who is inclin to look upon
the tour virtuoso as onli a pianist would be immens surpris if
he were call upon to compar hi store of univers inform with
that of the perform he would soon see that hi long close confin
behind the bar of the dollar sign had made him the intellectu
inferior of the musician he almost ignor but it is hardli fair to

the magic of magnet
magnet is sure on of the most enviabl possess of the
success pianist just what magnet is and how it come to be few
psychologist attempt to relat we all have our theori just why on
pianist who often blunder as readili as a rubinstein or who displai
hi mani shortcom at everi concert can invari draw larger
audienc and arous more applaus than hi confrr with weaker vital
forc although he be admittedli a better technician a more highli
educ gentleman and perhap a more sensit musician
charl frohman keenest of theatric produc attribut the actor
success to vital and in do thi he mere chose on of the
weaker synonym of magnet vital in thi sens doe not impli
great bodili strength it is rather soulstrength mindstrength
lifestrength professor john d quackenbo am md formerli of
columbia univers essai the follow definit of magnet in hi
excel hypnot therapeut
magnet is noth more than earnest and sincer
coupl with insight sympathi patienc and tact these
essenti cannot be bought and cannot be taught thei ar
born by natur thei ar dy with the red ripe of the
heart
but dr quackenbo is a physician and a philosoph had he been a
lexicograph he would have found the term magnet far more inclus
he would at least have admit the phenomenon which we have wit
so often when on possess with volcan vital overwhelm a great
audienc
the old idea that magnet is a kind of invis form of intellectu
or psychic electr ha gone down the grotesqu phrenolog
vagari of gall as well as some of the pseudoscientif theori of
that veri unusu man mesmer we all possess what is known as
magnet some have it in an unusu degre as did edwin booth franz
liszt phillip brook and bismarck it wa sure neither the art nor
the abil of daniel webster that made hi audienc accept some of hi
fatuou platitud as great utter nor wa it the histrion talent
alon of richard mansfield that enabl him to wring success from such
an obviou theatric contrapt as princ karl both webster with
hi fathomless ey and hi ponder voic and mansfield with hi
compel person were except exampl of magnet
a notabl exampl
among virtuoso paderewski is peculiarli forc in the person spell
he cast over hi audienc someon ha said that it cost on hundr
thousand dollar to exploit hi hair befor he made hi first american
tour but it wa by no mean curios to see hi hair which kept on
fill auditorium after auditorium i attend hi first concert in new
york and wa amaz to see a compar small gather of music
zealot hi command of the audienc wa at onc imperi the critic
some of whom would have found paderewski hirsut crown a delight
rack upon which to hang their ridicul went into ecstasi instead hi
art and hi strike person entir apart from hi appear
soon made him the greatest concert attract in the music world
anyon who ha convers with him for more than a few moment realiz
what the mean of the word magnet is hi entir bearinghi lofti
attitud of mind hi person digniti all contribut to the
inexplic attract that the arch hypnotist mesmer first describ
as anim magnet
that magnet of the pianist must be consid wholli apart from
person beauti and great physic strength is obviou to anyon who ha
given the subject a moment thought mani of the artist alreadi
mention in thi book who possess magnet similar to that of
paderewski could sure never make claim for person beauti neither is
magnet akin to that attract we all experi when we see a
power wellgroom hors a sleek hound a handsom tigerthat is
it is not mere admir for a beauti anim whether it ha ani
similar to the mysteri charm which make the doom bird lose
control of it wing upon the approach of a snake is difficult to
estim certainli in the paraphernalia of the modern recit with it
lower light and it solitari figur plai awai at a polish
instrument on mai find someth of the physic apparatu emploi by
the profession hypnotist to insur concentrationbut even thi can
not account for the pianist real attract if mr frohman
vital mean the vital spark the life element it come veri
close to a true definit of magnet for success without thi
preciou promethean forc is inconceiv it mai be onli a smoulder
ember in the soul of a dy chopin but if it is there it is
irresist until it becom extinct facial beauti and physic
prowess all made wai for the kind of magnet that socrat georg
sand juliu csar henri viii paganini emerson dean swift or richard
wagner possess
more wonder still is the fact that magnet is by no mean confin
to those who have fine train intellect or who have achiev great
reput some vaudevil buffoon or some gypsi fiddler mai have
more attract power than the virtuoso who had spent year in
develop hi mind and hi technic the averag virtuoso think far
more of hi geist hi talent or as emerson would have it the
shadow of the soulth otherwis than he doe of hi technic or hi
cadenza by what mystic mean magnet mai be develop the writer
doe not pretend to know possibl by place on deeper self shall
we sai subconsci self in closer communion with the great throb
problem of the invis though perpetu evid forc of natur
which surround us we mai becom more aliv more sensit vivifi
what would it mean to the young virtuoso if he could go to some occult
master some seer of a higher thought and acquir that lodeston
which ha drawn fame and fortun to the bless few hundr have spent
fortun upon charlatan in the attempt
all artist know the part that the audienc itself plai in fall
under the magnet spell of the perform it connect with the
phenomena of autosuggest is veri clear dr wundt the famou german
psychologist show a class of student how superstit unconsci
acquir in earli life affect sensibl adult who have long sinc pass
the stage at which thei might put ani credenc in omen at a concert
given by a famou player the audienc ha been well school in
anticip the artist alwai appear under a halo hi reput ha
made for him thi veri reput make hi conquest far easier than
that of the novic who ha to prove hi abil befor he can win the
sympathi of the audienc he is far more like to find the audienc en
rapport than indiffer sometim at the plai in a theater watch how
the audienc will unconsci mirror the facial express of the
forc actor in some similar manner the virtuoso on the concert
platform sensit the mind and emot of the sympathet audienc
if the effect is deep and last the artist is said to possess that
kohinoor of virtuosodommagnet
some wide read critic have made the veri natur error of confound

mai easili boast of a mechan as wonder as that of a liszt a
dalbert or a bachau but it can no more claim person than the
typewrit upon which thi articl is be written can claim to
reproduc the individu which character the handwrit of
myriad of differ person person then is the virtuoso on
great unassail stronghold it is person that make us want to
hear a half dozen differ render of a singl beethoven sonata by a
half dozen differ pianist each ha the charm and flavor of the
interpret
but person in it relat to art ha been so exquisit defin
by the inimit british essayist a c benson that we can do no
better than to quot hi word
i have late come to perceiv that the on thing which give valu to
ani piec of art whether it be book or pictur or music is that
subtl and evas thing which is call person no amount of
labor of zest even of accomplish can make up for the absenc of
thi qualiti it must be an almost instinct thing i believ of
cours the mere presenc of person in a work of art is not
suffici becaus the person reveal mai be lack in charm
and charm again is an instinct thing no artist can set out to
captur charm he will toil all the night and take noth but what
everi artist can and must aim at is to have a perfectli sincer point of
view he must take hi chanc as to whether hi point of view is an
attract on but sincer is the on indispens thing it is
useless to take opinion on trust to retail them to adopt them thei
must be form creat felt the work of a sincer artist is almost
certain to have some valu the work of an insincer artist is of it
veri natur worthless
mr benson charm is what the virtuoso feel as magnet it put
someth into the artist plai that he cannot defin for a moment
the vital spark flare into a bewild flame and all hi world is
peopl with moth hover around the divin fire
the greatest thing of all
if we have dwelt too long upon magnet those who know it import
in the artist life will readili perceiv the reason but do not let us
be led awai into think that magnet can take the place of hard
work even the tini prodigi ha a career of work behind him and the
master pianist ha often climb to hi posit over matterhorn and
mt blanc of industri dai of practic month of studi year of
struggl ar part of the biographi of almost everi on who ha attain

teacher in america be blame if the parent and the pupil fail to make
as seriou and continu an effort here atmospherebosh work long

becom a virtuoso with our increas wealth and advanc cultur
american parent ar begin to discov that given the same work and
the same amount of instruct music educ in america differ veri
slightli from music educ abroad
but we ar desert our young virtuoso most ungallantli in berlin she

wherea in america she neglect opportun equal good she never

have a strong sure resili touch in order to bring about climax
and make the rang of hi dynam power allcomprehens inde the

unfortun the number of virtuoso who have been taught exclus
in america is realli veri small it is not a question of abil upon
the part of the teacher or talent upon the part of the pupil it is

the stori of a wonder child
pepito arriola
my earliest recollect
so much that wa of interest to me wa continu occur while i wa
a child that it all seem like a kind of haze to me i cannot rememb
when i first commenc to plai for my mother tell me that i want to
reach out for the keyboard befor i wa out of her arm i have also
learn that when i wa about two and onehalf year of ag i could
quit readili plai after my mother anyth that the size of my hand
would permit me to plai
i love music so dearli and it wa such fun to run over the keyboard
and make the pretti sound that the piano wa realli my first and best
toi i love to hear my mother plai and continu beg her to plai
for me so that i could plai the same piec after her i knew noth of
music notat and plai entir by ear which seem to me the most
natur wai to plai at that time word wa sent to the king of spain
that i show talent and he becam interest in me and i plai
befor him
my friendship with arthur nikisch
a short time afterward herr arthur nikisch conductor of the
gewandhau orchestra at leipsic and at on time conductor of the
boston symphoni orchestra in america came to madrid to conduct the
philharmon orchestra for a special concert some on told him about my
plai and i wa permit to plai for him he becam so interest
that he insist upon my be taken to leipsic for further studi i wa
then four year of ag and although music advantag in spain ar
continu increas my mother thought it best at the time that she
should follow the great musician advic and that i should be taken to
the german citi
i want to sai that in my earliest work my mother made no effort to push
me or urg me to go ahead i love to plai for the sake of plai and
need no coax to spend time at the keyboard in my veri earli year
i wa permit to plai in public veri littl although there were
constant demand made to engag me i wa look upon as a kind of
curios and my mother want me to studi in the regular wai with good
master and also to acquir more strength befor i plai in public
veri much
i did howev plai at the great albert hall in london the big
build hold 8000 peopl but that wa so long ago that i have almost
forgotten all about it except that thei all seem pleas to see a
littl boi of four plai in so veri big a place i also plai for
royal personag includ the kaiser of germani who wa veri good to
me and gave me a beauti pin i like the kaiser veri much he seem
like a fine man
my first regular instruct
my first teacher asid from my mother wa a herr dreckendorf of
leipsic he wa veri kind to me and took the greatest pain but the
idea of learn the note wa veri distast to me i wa terribl
bore with the technic exercis he gave me but have sinc learn
that on can save much time by practic scale and exercis although
i do not like them i practic them everi dai now for a littl while
so as to get my finger in good work order
in about six week i knew all that wa expect of me in the wai of
scale in octav sixth third doubl third etc and my teacher
commenc to turn hi attent to studi and piec for the first
time i found music notat interest for then i realiz that it
wa not necessari for me to wait until some on els plai a piec
befor i could begin to explor it beauti ah it wa wonder
those first dai with the piec i wa in a new countri and could
hardli wait to master on at a time so eager wa i to reach the next
on and see just what it wa like
herr dreckendorf gave me some studi by dussek cramer the
invent of bach etc but befor long the fascin of plai
beauti piec wa so great that he found it hard to keep me awai from
them
earli repertori
so hungri wa i to find new music work that when i wa eight and a
half year old i could plai from memori such piec as the b flat minor
scherzo the a flat major polonais and most of the vals and tude
of chopin i also plai the sixth rhapsodi of liszt and the c minor
concerto of beethoven
in the mean time we move to berlin and thi ha been our home ever
sinc so you see i have seen far more of germani than of my nativ
countri spain in fact it seem more natur for me to speak german
than spanish at the ag of seven it wa my good fortun to come under
the instruct of alberto jona the spanish virtuoso who for mani
year wa at the head of a larg music school in america i can never be
grate enough to him for he ha taught me without remuner and
not even a father could be kinder to me when i left berlin for my
present tour tear came to our ey becaus i knew i wa leav my
best friend most of my present repertori ha been acquir under jona
and he ha been so so exact
he also saw to it that my train wa broad and not confin to those
compos whose work appeal most to me the result is that i now
appreci the work of all the compos for the piano beethoven i
found veri absorb i learn the appassionata sonata in on week
time and long for more my teacher howev insist upon my go
slowli and master all the littl detail
i have also develop a great fond for bach becaus i like to find
how he wind hi melodi in and out and make such beauti thing of
them i plai a great deal of bach includ the g minor organ fugu
which liszt plai the devil with in arrang it for the piano
good know it wa difficult enough for the organ in it origin
form i dont see why liszt want to make it more difficult
liszt is of cours consid a great master for the piano and i plai
hi work with great delight especi the campanella with it
beauti bell effect but i cannot look upon liszt as a pianist
compos in the same wai that on think of chopin as a pianist
compos the piano wa chopin natur tongu liszt tongu like
that of beethoven wa the orchestra he knew no difficulti accord
to the manner in which he wrote hi own work consequ on must
think of the orchestra in plai liszt work while the work of
chopin suggest onli the piano
my daili practic
dure most of my life my practic ha never exceed two hour a dai
in thi countri while on tour i never practic more than on and
onehalf hour thi is not necessari becaus of the concert
themselv which keep up my technic work i never worri about my
finger if i can think the piec right my finger will alwai plai
the note my mother insist upon my be out in the open air all the
time i am not studi and practic and i am out the better part of
the dai
at my practic period i devot at least fifteen or twenti minut to
technic exercis and strive to plai all the scale in the differ
form in all the kei onc each dai i then plai some of my concert
number continu try to note if there is ani place that requir
attent if there is i at onc spend a littl time try to improv
the passag
it is veri larg a matter of think the music thought right and
then sai it in the right wai if you think it right and your aim at
the keyboard is good you ar not like to hit the wrong note even in
skip such as on find in the rubinstein vals in e flat i do not ever
rememb of hit the upper note wrong it all seem so easi to me
that i am sure that if other children in america would look upon other
exampl in the same wai thei could not find their work so veri
difficult i love to practic chopin on cannot be so intim with
bach he is a littl cold and unfriendli until on know him veri well
gener educ
i have said that we plai as we think the mind must be continu
improv or the finger will grow dull in order to see the beauti in
music we must see the beauti in other studi i have a privat
teacher who come to me in berlin and teach me differ studi i
have studi some latin french and the regular school studi
electr interest me more than i can tell you and i like to learn
about it but my greatest interest is in the studi of astronomi sure
noth could be finer than to look at the star i have friend among
the astronom of berlin who let me look through their telescop and
tell me all about the differ constel and the world that look
like moon when you see them enlarg it is all so wonder that it
make on never ceas think
i also like to go to factori and learn how differ thing ar made
i think that there ar so mani thing that on can learn outsid of a
schoolroom for instanc i went to a wire factori recent and i am
sure that i found out a great mani thing i might never have found out
in book on also learn by travel and when i am on my tour i feel
that i learn more of the differ peopl and the wai thei live than i
ever could from geographi dont you think i am a lucki boi on must
studi geographi howev to learn about map and the wai in which
countri ar form i have tour in germani russia and england and
now in america america interest me wonderfulli everyth seem so
much aliv and i like the climat veri much
theoret studi
music theori bore me now almost as much as my first technic
studi did richard strauss the great german compos ha veri kindli
offer to teach me i like him veri much and he is so kind but hi
thunder music effect sometim seem veri noisi to me i know mani
of the rule of harmoni but thei ar veri uncomfort and
disagre to me
i would far rather write my music as it come to me herr nikisch sai
that when i do it that wai i make veri few blunder but i know i can
never be a compos until i have master all the branch of music
theori i am now write a symphoni i plai some part for herr
nikisch and he ha agre to produc it of cours the orchestr part
will have to be written for me but i know what instrument i want to
express certain idea
put down the note upon paper is so tiresom why cant on think
the music thought and have them preserv without the tediou work of
write them out sometim befor i can get them on paper thei ar
goneno on know where and the worst of all is that thei never come
back it is far greater fun to plai the piano or plai footbal or go
row
read and studi
i love to read and my favorit of all book is the three musket
i have also read someth of shakespear goeth schiller and mani
other writer i like part of the great spanish novel don quixot
but i find it hard to read as a whole i think that music student ought
to read a great deal it make them think and it give them poetic
thought
music is after all onli anoth kind of poetri and if we get poetic
idea from book we becom more poetic and our music becom more
beauti the student who think onli of hammer down kei at the
piano cannot plai in a manner in which peopl will take pleasur piano
plai is so much more than mere press down kei on ha to tell
peopl thing that cannot be told in wordsthat is what music is
at the concert
i do not know what it is to be nervou at concert i have plai so
much and i am alwai so sure of what i am go to plai that nervous
is out of the question of cours i am anxiou about the wai in which
audienc will receiv my plai i want to pleas them so much and
dont want them to applaud me becaus i am a boi but would rather have
them come as real musiclov to enjoi the music itself if i cannot
bring pleasur to them in that wai i do not deserv to be befor the
public
my concert ar usual about on hour in length although i sometim
plai encor for some time after the concert i make it a practic not
to eat for a few hour befor the concert as doctor have told my
mother that my mind will be in better shape i want to thank the mani
friend i have made among the student who have come to my concert and
i hope that i mai have told them some thing which will help them in
their work

it is somewhat surpris how veri littl differ exist between the

publish and some of thi present the advantag of be an
improv upon the oldan improv which mai be term an
advancebut taken all in all the advanc ha been veri slight when
compar with the astonish advanc made in other scienc and other
phase of human progress in thi time
it would seem that the scienc of music for the process of studi
the art ar undoubtedli scientif left littl territori for new
explor and inventor despit the great number of tude that have
been written imagin for on moment what a desert the technic of music
would be without czerni clementi tausig pischnato sai noth of
the great work of scarlatti and bach which have an effect upon the
technic but ar realli great work of music art

arpeggio and bach and you have the basi upon which my technic work
stand pianist who have been curiou about my technic
accomplish have appar been amaz when i have told them that
scale ar my great technic mainstaythat is scale plu hard work
thei evid have thought that i had some kind of alchem secret
like the philosoph stone which wa design to turn the baser metal
into gold i possess no secret which ani earnest student mai not
acquir if he will work in the laboratori of music long enough there
ar certain artist point which onli come with longcontinu
experi
as the chemist find the desir result by intermin heartbreak
elimin so the artist must weigh and test hi mean until he find
the on most like to produc the most beauti or the most

all possibl emphasi that the sourc of my technic equip is
scale scale scale i find their continu daili practic not onli
benefici but necessari i still find it desir to practic scale
for half an hour a dai
bach music omnipot
it seem almost foolish to repeat what ha been said so mani time
about the wonder old cantor of leipsic johann sebastian bach
howev there mai still be some who have not yet becom acquaint with
the indisput fact that the practic of bach is the shortest
quickest road to technic finish busoni ha enlarg upon bach
imposs as that mai seem but as a modern bridg is sometim built
upon wonder old foundat busoni ha taken the idea of bach and
with hi penetr and interpret abil ha been abl to make
the mean more clear and more effect ani young pianist who aspir
to have hi hand in condit to respond to the subtl suggest of

the old that is ever new
i have seen mani wai and mean tri out some seem like an attempt to
save time at the expens of thorough furthermor the mean which
have produc the great pianist of the past ar like to differ but
littl from those which will produc the pianist of the futur
the ultramodern teacher who is inclin to think scale oldfashion
should go to hear de pachmann who practic scale everi dai de
pachmann who ha been a virtuoso for a great mani year still find

destin to alter the technic of the instrument as did the composit
of liszt for instanc thi is a difficult question but it would seem
that the borderland of pianist difficulti had been reach in the
composit and transcript of busoni and godowski the new french
school of debussi ravel and other is differ in type but doe not
make ani more sever technic demand
howev it is hard for on to imagin anyth more complic or
more difficult than the godowski arrang of the chopin studi i
fail to see how pianofort technic can go much beyond these unless on
get more finger or more hand godowski treatment of these studi
is marvel not onli from a technic standpoint but from a music
standpoint as well he ha ad a new flavor to the individu
masterpiec of chopin he ha made them wonderfulli clever and realli
veri interest studi in harmoni and counterpoint so that on
forget their technic intricaci in the beauti of the composit
on cannot sai that their origin beauti ha been enhanc but he ha
made them wonderfulli fascin composit despit their aggrav
complic for the student
mere difficulti no longer astound
the dai when the show of startl technic skill wa suffici to
make a reput for a pianist is fortun past the mechan
plai devic have possibl been respons for thi the public
refus to admir anyth that can be done by a machin and long for
someth finer more subtl more close alli to the soul of the
artist thi doe not mean howev that the necess for a
comprehens technic is depreci quit the contrari is true the
need for an allcomprehens technic is greater than ever befor but
the public demand for the pure music the pure artist is be
continu manifest
modern compos ar write with thi in view rather than huge
technic combin the giant of todai to my mind is indisput
rachmaninoff he is write the greatest origin music for piano of ani
live compos all of hi composit ar pianist and he doe not
condescend to pander to a trifl public tast he is a man with a
great mind and in addit to thi he ha a delight sens of
proport and a feel for the beauti all of which make him a
compos of the master mould hi composit will endur as long as
music
modern composit
for other of the type of scriabin i care less although i am sensibl
to the beauti of mani of their composit thei have not howev
the splendid mould of rachmaninoff nor have thei hi vigor
origin doubtless some of these men will produc great origin
composit in the futur composit that ar simpli not bad ar
hardli worth the paper thei ar written upon for thei will not last as
long the composit that will last is a great new origin thought
inspir nobl and element but work out with the distinct
craftsmanship of the great master
i am veri partial to debussi he ha an extraordinari atmospher and
after on ha form a tast for him hi composit ar allur
particularli hi homag rameau jardin sou la pluie and dun
cahier desquiss which i have been plai upon my american tour
the most difficult composit
i have continu been ask what is the most difficult
composit the question alwai amus me but i suppos it is veri
human and in line with the desir to measur the highest build the
tallest mountain the longest river or the oldest castl why is such a
premium put upon mere difficulti strang to sai no on ever seem to
think it necessari to inquir what is the most beauti piec
difficulti in music should by no mean be estim by technic
complic to plai a mozart concerto well is a coloss difficult
undertak the pianist who ha work for hour to get such a
composit as near as possibl to hi concept of perfect is never
given the credit for hi work except by a few connoisseur mani of
whom have been through a similarli exact experi month mai be
spent upon compar simpl composit such as the haydn sonata
or the mozart sonata and the music public is blind to the addit
finish or polish so evid to the virtuoso
prais that irrit
the opposit of thi is also true a littl show of bravura possibl
in a passag which ha not cost the pianist more than ten minut of
frivol practic will turn mani of the unthink auditor into a
roar mob thi is of cours veri distress to the sincer artist
who strive to establish himself by hi real worth
of cours there ar some composit which present difficulti which
few work hard enough to surmount among these might be mention the
godowskychopin tude particularli the tude in a flat opu 25
no 1 which is alwai especi exasper for the student
suffici advanc to approach it the don juan fantasi of liszt
the brahmspaganini variat and the beethoven opu 106 which
when properli plai demand enorm technic skill on certainli
save a lot of bother when on discard it from on repertoir if
these four piec ar not the most difficult piec thei ar certainli
among the most difficult
why not seek the beauti
but why seek difficulti when there is so much that is quit as
beauti and yet not difficult why try to make a bouquet of oak tree
when the ground is cover with exquisit flower the piano is a solo
instrument and ha it limit some piano music is said to sound
orchestr as a matter of fact a great deal of it would sound better
with the orchestra
real piano music is rare the piano appear to be too small for some of
our modern titan among the compos when thei write for the piano
thei seem to be exhibit a conceal long for the on hundr or
more men of the modern orchestra on of the reason why the work of
debussi appeal to me is that he manag to put so much color into hi
piano piec without suggest the orchestra much of hi music is
wonder in thi respect and moreov the musician of the futur
will appreci thi fact more and more
exercis that give immedi help
no on exercis can be depend upon to meet all the vari condit
which aris in the practic of the dai but i have frequent emploi a
simpl exercis which seem to coax the hand into muscular activ in
a veri short time it is so simpl that i am diffid about suggest
it howev element process lead to larg structur sometim
the egyptian pyramid were built ag befor the ag of steam and
electr and scientist ar still wonder how those massiv stone
were ever put in place
the exercis i us most apart from scale is realli base upon a
principl which is constantli emploi in all scale plai and in all
piano plai that of put the thumb over and under the finger did
you ever stop to think how continu thi is emploi on hardli goe
on step beyond the element grade befor on encount it it
demand a muscular action entir differ from that of press down
the kei either with the finger forearm or arm motion
start with the abovenam principl and devis new exercis to
meet the veri human need for varieti i plai someth like thi
illustr
the next form would emploi anoth finger
illustr
the next form might be
illustr
these i transpos through sever kei for instanc
illustr
note that i am not give an arbitrari exercis but simpli suggest
the plan upon which the student mai work there is a great deal of fun
in devis new exercis it assist in help the student to
concentr of cours these exercis ar onli attempt after all the
standard exercis found in book have been exhaust
avoid too complic exercis
i often think that teacher make a great mistak by give too
complic exercis a complic exercis lead awai from clear
think and concentr the simpl exercis will never seem dull or
dry if the pupil ambit is right after all it is not so much what
is done as how it is done give less thought to the materi and more to
the correct of the mean with which on plai there should be
unceas varieti in studi a chang at everi practic period is

harold bauer wa born in london england april 28 1875 hi father wa
an accomplish amateur violinist through him the futur virtuoso wa
enabl to gain an excel idea of the beauti literatur of chamber
music when a boi mr bauer studi privat with the celebr violin
teacher politz at the ag of ten he becam so profici that he
made hi dbut as a violinist in london thereaft in hi tour of
england he met with great success everywher
in the artist circl of london mr bauer met a musician name graham
moor who gave him some idea upon the detail of the technic of
pianofort plai which mr bauer had studi or rather pick up by
himself without ani thought of ever abandon hi career as a
violinist mr moor had expect to rehears some orchestr
accompani on a second piano with paderewski who wa then prepar
some concerto for public perform mr moor wa taken ill and sent
hi talent music friend mr bauer in hi place paderewski
immedi took an interest in hi talent accompanist and advis him
to go to pari to continu hi studi with gorski
after mani privat in pari mr bauer unabl to secur engag

artist aspect of piano studi
harold bauer
the immedi relat of technic to music
while it give me great pleasur to talk to the great number of
student studi the piano i can assur you that it is with no littl
diffid that i ventur to approach these veri subject about which
thei ar probabl most anxiou to learn in the first place word tell
veri littl and in the second place my whole career ha been so
differ from the orthodox method that i have been constantli
compel to contriv mean of my own to meet the myriad of artist
conting as thei have arisen in my work it is larg for thi
reason that i felt compel recent to refus a veri flatter offer
to write a book on piano plai my whole life experi make me
incap of perceiv what the normal method of pianist studi
should be as a result of thi i am oblig with my own pupil to invent
continu new mean and new plan for work with each student
without the convent technic basi to work upon thi ha
necessarili result in sever aspect of pianofort studi which ar
natur somewhat differ from the commonli accept idea of the
technician in the first place the onli technic studi of ani kind i
have ever done ha been that technic which ha had an immedi relat
to the music messag of the piec i have been studi in other
word i have never studi technic independ of music i do not
condemn the ordinari technic method for those who desir to us them
and see good in them i fear howev that i am unabl to discuss them
adequ as thei ar outsid of my person experi
the aim of technic
when as a result of circumst entir beyond my control i
abandon the studi of the violin in order to becom a pianist i wa
forc to realiz in view of my veri imperfect technic equip
that in order to take advantag of the opportun that offer for
public perform it would be necessari for me to find some mean of
make my plai accept without spend month and probabl year
in acquir mechan profici the onli wai of overcom the
difficulti seem to be to devot myself entir to the music
essenti of the composit i wa interpret in the hope that the
pure technic defici which i had neither time nor knowledg to
enabl me to correct would pass compar unnot provid i wa
abl to give suffici interest and compel suffici attent to the
emot valu of the work thi kind of studi forc upon me in the
first instanc through reason of expedi becam a habit and
gradual grew into a convict that it wa a mistak to practic
technic at all unless such practic should conduc to some definit
specif and immedi music result
i do not wish to be misunderstood in make thi statement contain
as it doe an express of opinion that wa form in earli year of
studi but which nevertheless i have never sinc felt ani reason to
chang it is not my intent to impli that technic studi is
unnecessari or that pure muscular train is to be neglect i mean
simpli to sai that in everi detail of technic work the germ of music
express must be discov and cultiv and that in muscular
train for forc and independ the simplest possibl form of
physic exercis ar all that is necessari
the singer and the violinist ar alwai studi music even when
thei practic a success of singl note not so with the pianist
howev for an isol note on the piano whether plai by the most
accomplish artist or the man in the street mean noth absolut
noth
seek individu express
at the time of which i speak my greatest difficulti wa natur to
give a constant and definit direct to my work and in my effort to
obtain a suitabl muscular train which should enabl me to produc
express sound while i neglect no opportun of close observ
the work of pianofort teacher and student around me i found that
most of the technic work which wa be done with infinit pain and
a vast expenditur of time wa not onli nonproduct of express
sound but actual harm and mislead as regard the develop
of the music sens i could see no object in practic even in
scale consid that a perfectli even scale is essenti devoid of
emot music signific i could see no reason for limit
tone product to a certain kind of sound that wa call a good
tone sinc the express of feel necessarili demand in mani case
the us of rel harsh sound moreov i could see no reason for
try to overcom what ar gener call natur defect such as
the compar weak of the fourth finger for exampl as it seem
to me rather a good thing than otherwis that each finger should
natur and normal possess a characterist motion of it own
it is differ that count in art not similar everi
individu express is a form of art why not then make an artist of
each finger by cultiv it special aptitud instead of adapt a
system of train deliber calcul to destroi these individu
characterist in bring all the finger to a common level of
lifeless machin
these and similar reflect i discov were carri me
continu farther awai from the ideal of most of the pianist
student and teacher with whom i wa in contact and it wa not long
befor i definit abandon all hope of obtain by ani of the mean
i found in us the result for which i wa strive consequ
from that time to the present my work ha necessarili been more or less
independ and empir in it natur and while i trust i am neither
prejud nor intoler in my attitud toward pianofort educ in
it gener aspect i cannot help feel that a great deal of natur
tast is stifl and a great deal of mediocr creat by the
persist and unintellig studi of such thing as an even scale or
a good tone
lastli it is quit incomprehens to me why ani on method of
technic should be superior to ani other consid that as far as i
wa abl to judg no teacher or pupil ever claim more for ani
technic system than that it gave more technic abil than some
other technic system i have never been abl to convinc myself as a
matter of fact that on system doe give more abil than anoth but
even if there were on infinit superior to all the rest it would
still fail to satisfi me unless it whole aim and object were to
facilit music express
natur studi in thi wai requir my power of concentr to
be train to the veri highest point thi matter of concentr is
far more import than most teacher imagin and the perus of some
standard work on psycholog will reveal thing which should help the
student greatli mani pupil make the mistak of think that onli a
certain kind of music demand concentr wherea it is quit as
necessari to concentr the mind upon the plai of a simpl scale as
for the studi of a beethoven sonata
the resist of the medium
in everi form of art the medium that is emploi offer a certain
resist to perfect freedom of express and the natur of thi
resist must be fulli understood befor it can be overcom the poet
the painter the sculptor and the musician each ha hi own problem to
solv and the pianist in particular is frequent brought to the verg
of despair through the fact that the instrument in requir the
expenditur of physic and nervou energi absorb so to speak a
larg proport of the intens which the music demand
with mani student the piano is onli a barriera wall between them and
music their thought never seem to penetr farther than the kei
thei plod along for year appar strive to make pianoplai
machin of themselv and in the end result in becom someth
rather inferior
condit ar doubtless better now than in former year teacher give
studi with some music valu and the month even year of keyboard
grind without the least suggest of anyth music or gratifi to
the natur sens of the beauti ar veri probabl a thing of the
past but here again i fear the teacher in mani case make a pervert
us of studi and piec for technic purpos if we practic a piec
of real music with no other idea than that of develop some technic
point it often ceas to becom a piec of music and result in be a
kind of technic machineri onc a piec is mechan it is difficult
to make it otherwis all the cog wheel bolt and screw which an
overzeal ambit to becom perfect technic ha built up ar made
so evid that onli the most patient and endur kind of an audienc
can toler them
the pervers of studi
peopl talk about us the music of bach to accomplish some
technic purpos in a perfectli heartbreak manner thei never seem
to think of interpret bach but rather make of him a kind of
technic elev by mean of which thei hope to reach some marvel
music height we even hear of the studi of chopin be pervert
in a similarli viciou manner but bach the master of master is the
greatest suffer
it ha becom a truism to sai that technic is onli a mean to an end
but i veri much doubt if thi assert should be accept without
question suggest as it doe the advis of studi someth
that is not music and which is believ at some futur time to be
capabl of be marvel transform into an artist express
properli understood technic is art and must be studi as such
there should be no technic in music which is not music in itself
the unit of music express
the piano is of all instrument the least express natur and
it is of the greatest import that the student should realiz the
natur of it resist the action of a piano is pure a piec of
machineri where the individu note ha no mean when the kei is onc
struck and the note sound there is a complet action and the note
cannot then be modifi nor chang in the least the onli thing over
which the pianist ha ani control is the length of the tone and thi
again mai not last ani longer than the natur vibrat of the
string although it mai be shorten by relinquish the kei it
make no differ whether the individu note is struck by a child or
by paderewskiit ha in itself no express valu in the case of the
violin the voic and all other instrument except the organ the
individu note mai be modifi after it is emit or struck and in
thi modif is contain the possibl of a whole world of
emot express
our sole mean of express then in piano plai li in the
relat of on note to the other note in a seri or in a chord
herein li the difficulti the resist to perfect freedom of which i
have spoken befor the princip subject for intellig and care
studi and yet so few student appear to understand it their great
effort seem to be to make all the nois in a given seri as much alik
as coin from a mint thei come to the piano as their onli instrument
and never seek to take a lesson from the voic or from the other
instrument which have express resourc infinit superior to those
possess by the piano the princip charm of the piano li in the
command which the player ha over mani voic sing togeth but
until the pianist ha a regard for the individu voic in it relat
to the ensembl he ha no mean with which to make hi work realli
beauti
there is a great need for more breadth in music studi thi as i know
ha been said veri often but it doe not hurt to sai it again the more
a man know the more he ha experienc the wider hi mental vision in
all branch of human inform the more he will have to sai we need
men in music with big mind wide grasp and definit aim musician ar
far too prone to becom overspeci thei seem to have an
unquench thirst to master the jargon and the infinit varieti of
method which ar thrust upon us in these dai rather than a genuin
desir to develop their music aim music is acquir a technolog as
confus and as extens as bacteriolog there seem to be no end to
the new kind of method in the mind of furtiv and fertil inventor
each new method in turn seem to breed anoth and so on ad nauseam
among other thing i would suggest the advis for pianist to
cultiv some knowledg of the construct of their instrument
strang as it mai seem it is nevertheless a fact that the averag
pianist know practic noth of a piano be in mani case
entir unawar of such simpl thing as how the tone is produc the
function of the pedal is as unknown to them as geologi is to the coal
heaver thi ignor lead frequent to the employ of motion and
method that can onli be character as ridicul in the extrem
music first the instrument afterward
from the manner in which mani ambiti and earnest student plai it
would seem that thei had their mind fix upon someth which could
not be convei to the world in ani other form than that of the sound
which come from the piano of cours the piano ha an idiom peculiarli
it own and some compos have emploi thi idiom with such natur
freedom that their music suffer when transpos for ani other
instrument the music of chopin is peculiarli pianist but it is
first of all music and ani on of the wonder melodi which came
from the fertil brain of the polishfrench geniu could be plai upon
on of mani differ instrument besid the piano the duti of the
interpret should sure be to think of the composit as such and to
interpret it primarili as music irrespect of the instrument some
student sit down befor the keyboard to plai the piano precis as
though thei were go to plai a game of card thei have learn
certain rule govern the game and thei do not dare disobei these
rule thei think of rule rather than of the ultim resultth
music itself the idiom of the italian languag is appropri here the
italian do not sai i plai the piano but rather i sound the piano
suono il pianofort if we had a littl more sound of the
piano that is produc real music effect and a littl less
plai on ivori kei the plai of our student would be more
interest
varieti the spice of art
it can hardli be question that the genesi of all music art is to
be found in song the most natur the most fluent and the most
beauti form of music express how much everi instrumentalist can
learn from the art of sing
it is a physic imposs for the voic to produc two note in
success exactli alik thei mai sound veri similar but there is a
differ quit percept to the highli train ear when a singer
start a phrase a certain amount of motiv power is requir to set the
vocal apparatu in vibrat after the first note ha been attack
with the full forc of the breath there is natur not so much weight
or pressur left for the follow note it is howev possibl for
the second note to be as loud or even louder than the first note but
in order to obtain the addit forc on the second note it is
necessari to compens for the lack of forc due to the loss of the
origin weight or pressur by increas what might be call the
nervou energi that is to sai by expel the breath with
proportion greater speed
muscular and nervou energi
the manifest of nervou energi in thi manner is quit differ
from the manifest of muscular energi although both ar of cours
intim connect muscular energi begin at it maximum and
gradual diminish to the point of exhaust wherea nervou energi
rise in an inconceiv short space of time to it climax and then
drop immedi to noth nervou energi mai be said to be
repres by an increas rapid of emiss it is what the athlet
would call a spurt
what i have said about the voic appli equal to all other
instrument the piano and the organ alon except it is obviou that
the plai of the wind instrument must be subject to the limit
of the breath and in the case of the violin and the other string
instrument where the bow suppli the motiv power it is imposs
for two note plai in success to sound absolut alik if the
first note of a phrase is attack with the weight of the whole bow
behind it the second note will follow with just so much less weight
and if the violinist desir to intensifi ani of the succeed tone
he must do so by the employ of the nervou energi i have mention
when a differ in the qualiti of tone is bound to result the pianist
should close observ and endeavor to imit these characterist
which so vividli convei the idea of organ life in all it infinit
varieti and which ar inher in everi medium for artist express
phrase and breath
it would take a book and by no mean a small on to go into thi
matter of phrase which i am now discuss even in such a book there
would doubtless be mani point which would be open to assault for
stickler in psycholog technolog i am not issu a propaganda or
write a thesi for the purpos of have someth to defend but
mere give a few offhand fact that have benefit me in my work
howev it is my convict that it is the duti of the pianist to try
to understand the analog to the physic limit which surround the
more natur medium of music expressionth voic and the
violinand to appli the result of hi observ to hi piano
plai
the natur effect of emot
there is anoth relat between phrase and breath which the
student mai investig to advantag the emot have a direct and
immedi effect upon the breath and as the brain inform the nervou
system of new emot impress the visibl evid mai be first
observ in the breath it is quit unnecessari to go into the
physiolog or psycholog of thi but a littl reflect will
immedi indic what i mean
it is imposs to wit a disastr accid without show
mental agit and excit in hurri breath joi anger fear
love tranquil and griefal ar character by differ mode
of breath and a train actor must studi thi with great close
the artist at the piano mai be said to breath hi phrase a phrase
that is pure contempl in charact is breath in a tranquil
fashion without ani suggest of nervou agit if we go through
the scale of express start with contempl tranquil to
the climax of dramat intens the breath will be emit
progress quicker and quicker everi music phrase ha some kind of
express messag to deliv if a perfectli tranquil phrase is given
out in a success of short breath indic as thei would
agit it would be a contradict just as it would be perfectli
inhuman to suppos that in express dramat intens it would be
possibl to breath slowli
in conclus i would urg student to cultiv a veri definit
mental attitud as to what thei realli desir to accomplish do you wish
to make music if so think music and noth but music all the
time down to the smallest detail even in technic is your ambit to
plai scale octav doubl note and trill then by all mean
concentr your mind on them to the exclus of everyth els but

the secret of success in the career of a virtuoso is not easili
defin mani element have to be consid given great talent
success is not by ani mean assur mani seemingli extran qualiti
must be cultiv mani mistak must be avoid
let me start out with a caution no greater mistak could possibl be
made than to assum that frequent public appear or extend concert
tour in earli youth is essenti to a great career as a virtuoso on
the contrari i would sai that such a cours is posit harm the
experi of frequent plai in public is essenti if on would get
rid of stage fright or undu nervous and would gain that repos and
selfconfid without which success is imposs but such experi
should be had onli after the attain of physic and mental matur
a young boi or girl though ever so much of a prodigi if taken on an
extens concert tour not onli becom unduli selfconsci
conceit vain and easili satisfi with hi or her work butand thi
is the allimport pointrun the risk of undermin hi or her
health the preciou dai of youth should be devot primarili to the
store up of health without which last success is imposs
noth is more harm to sound physic develop and mental growth
than the strain of extens tour it is true that on great virtuoso
now befor the public plai frequent befor larg audienc as an
infant prodigi but happili wise and effici influenc serv to
check thi mad career the young artist wa place in the hand of a
great teacher and given a chanc to reach full physic matur and
artist statur befor resum public appear had it been
otherwis it is a matter of common belief that thi great talent would
have fizzl out
by thi i do not mean that the pupil should be prevent from plai
at recit in the home citi plai of thi kind give the pupil
confid and smooth the wai for hi work as a matur artist these
perform should be rare except in the case of perform given in
the home of the pupil or at the teacher home what i object to is the
exploit on a larg scale of the infant prodigi

the layman can hardli conceiv how difficult it is to plai at the same
time two theme differ in charact and run in opposit
direct the student fulli realiz thi difficulti when he find
that it take year to master it these separ theme must be
individu thei must be conceiv as separ but their bear
upon the work as a whole must never be overlook
the puriti of style to be found in bach in connect with hi
marvel contrapunt design should be expound to the student at as
earli an ag as hi intellectu develop will permit it mai take
some time to creat a tast for bach but the teacher will be reward
with result so substanti and perman that all the troubl and time
will seem well worth while
there is also a refin influenc about which i would like to speak
the practic of bach seem to fairli grind off the rough edg and
instead of a raw bungl technic the student acquir a kind of
finish from the studi of the old master of eisenach that noth els
can give him
i do not mean to be understood that the studi of bach even if it be
ever so thorough suffic in itself to give on a perfect technic
vastli more is necessari the student who would fit himself for a
concert career must have the advic of a great teacher and must work
incessantli and conscienti under hi guidanc i emphas the
studi of bach mere becaus i find it is not pursu as much as it
deserv that technic finish is of the veri essenc of success in
public appear goe without sai it is not onli indispens for
a credit perform but the conscious of possess it
contribut to that confid of the player without which he cannot
hope to make an impress upon hi audienc
leschetizki and method
speak about teacher remind me to put forth thi caution do not
pin your faith to a method there is good and ala some bad in most
method we hear a great deal these dai about the leschetizki method
dure the five year i wa with leschetizki he made it veri plain that
he had no fix method in the ordinari sens of the word like everi
good teacher he studi the individu of each pupil and taught him
accord to that individu it might almost be said that he had a
differ method for each pupil and i have often said that
leschetizki method is to have no fix method of cours there ar
certain preparatori exercis which with slight variat he want all
hi pupil to go through but it is not so much the exercis in
themselv as the patienc and pain persist in execut them to
which thei ow their virtu of cours leschetizki ha hi prefer
for certain work for their great educ valu he ha hi
convict as to the true interpret to be given to the variou
composit but those do not form what mai properli be call a
method person i am rather skeptic when anybodi announc that he
teach ani particular method leschetizki without ani particular
method is a great forc by virtu of hi tremend interest
person and hi great qualiti as an artist he is himself a
neverend sourc of inspir at eighti he wa still a youth full
of vital and enthusiasm some student diffid but worthi wa
alwai encourag anoth wa incit by sarcasm still anoth wa
scold outright practic illustr on the piano show how not
to do it tell of pertin stori to elucid a point ar among
the mean which he constantli emploi to bring out the best that wa in
hi pupil a good teacher cannot insur success and leschetizki ha
natur had mani pupil who will never becom great virtuoso it wa
never in the pupil and no matter how great the teacher he cannot
creat talent that doe not exist
the mani book publish upon the leschetizki system by hi assist
have merit but thei by no mean constitut a leschetizki system thei
simpli give some veri ration preparatori exercis that the assist
give in prepar pupil for the master leschetizki himself laugh when
on speak of hi method or system
success in public appear will never come through ani system or
method except that which work toward the end of make a matur and
genuin artist
wellselect program
skill in the arrang of an artist program ha much to do with
hi success thi matter ha two distinct aspect firstli the program
must look attract and secondli it must sound well in the
rendit when i sai the program must look attract i mean that it
must contain work which interest concertgo it should be neither
entir convent nor should it contain novelti exclus the
classic should be repres becaus the larg armi of student
expect to be especi benefit by hear these perform by a great
artist novelti must be place on the program to make it attract to
the matur habitu of the concert room
but more import to my mind is the other aspect of program make
which i have mention there must be contrast in the charact and
tonal natur of the composit plai thei must be so group that
the interest of the hearer will be not onli sustain to the end but
will gradual increas it goe without sai that each composit
should have merit and worth as music literatur but beyond that
there should be varieti in the charact of the differ composit
the classic the romant and the modern composit should all be
given represent to plai sever slow movement or sever
vivaci movement in success would tend to tire the listen
anticlimax should be avoid
it mai truli be said that program make is in itself a high art it is
difficult to give advic on thi subject by ani gener statement
gener ar too often mislead i would advis the young
artist to studi carefulli the program of the most success artist
and to attempt to discov the principl underli their arrang
on thing which should never be forgotten is that the object of a
concert is not mere to show off the skill of the perform but to
instruct entertain and elev the audienc the bulk of the program
should be compos of standard work but novelti of genuin worth
should be given a place on the program
person
the player person is of inestim import in win the
approv of the public i do not refer particularli to person beauti
although it cannot be doubt that a pleas appear is help in
conquer an audienc what i mean is sincer individu
tempera what we vagu describ as magnet is often possess by
player who can lai no particular claim to person beauti some player
seem fairli to hypnot their audiencesy hypnot them thi is
not done by practic ani speci of black art or by conscious
follow ani psycholog formula but by the sheer intens of
feel of the artist at the moment of perform
the great perform in such moment of passion forget himself
entir he is in a sort of artist tranc technic masteri of the
composit be presuppos the artist need not and doe not give
thought to the matter of plai the note correctli but recreat
in himself what he feel to have been the mood of the compos
recreat the composit itself it is thi kind of plai which
establish an invis cord connect the player and the hearer
heart and swai himself by the feel of the moment he swai hi
audienc he make the music he draw from the instrument suprem in
everi soul in the audienc hi feel and passion ar contagi and
carri the audienc awai these ar the moment not onli of the greatest
triumph but of the greatest exult for the artist he who cannot
thu swai audienc will never rise abov mediocr
do not attempt the imposs
to those who ar still in the preparatori stage of develop i am
glad to give on word of advic do not plai piec that ar awai
beyond your grasp thi is the greatest fault in our american music
educ system of todai pupil ar permit to plai work that
ar technic imposs for them to hope to execut without year of
prepar what a huge blunder thi is
the pupil come to the teacher let us sai with the second hungarian
rhapsodi of liszt it take some fortitud for the conscienti
teacher to tell the pupil that she should work with the c major sonata
of haydn instead the pupil with a kind of confid that is to sai
the least danger imagin that the teacher is try to keep her
back and often goe to anoth teacher who will gratifi her whim
american girl think that thei can do everyth noth is beyond
them thi is a countri of great accomplish and thei do not realiz
that in music art is long the virtuoso come to a great metropoli
and plai a moszkowski concerto of great difficulti the next dai the
music store exhaust their stock of thi work and a dozen miss who
might with difficulti plai a mendelssohn song with word ar buri
in the avalanch of technic imposs that the allur concerto

foreign dbut
unfortun a foreign dbut seem to be necessari for the artist
who would court the favor of the american public foreign pianist get
engag long befor their manag in america ever hear them in the
present state of affair if an american pianist were to have the
abil of three liszt and three rubinstein in on person he could
onli hope for meager reward if he did not have a great european
reput behind him
the condit is absurd and regrett but nevertheless true we have
mani splendid teacher in americaa fine as there ar in the world
we have in our larger citi music audienc whose judgment is as
discrimin as that of the best european audienc mani an artist
with a great european reput ha come to thi countri and fail
to make good in the judgment of our critic and audienc went back
with hi reput serious impair nevertheless as i have state
the american artist without a european reput ha no draw power
and therefor doe not interest the manag and the piano
manufactur who nowadai have larg supplant the manag thi
be so i can onli advis the american artist to do as other had to
do go to europ give a few concert in berlin london vienna or
pari let the concert director who arrang your concert paper the
hous but be sure you get a few critic in the audienc have your
critic translat and get them republish in american paper
then if you have real merit you mai get a chanc
the interest in music in the unit state at the present time is
phenomen european peopl have no concept of it nowher in the
world can such interest be found audienc in differ part of the
countri do not differ veri greatli from the standpoint of intellig
appreci when we consid the great uncultur mass of peasant

there is no basi of comparison america is alreadi a music countri a
veri music countri it is onli in it failur to properli support
nativ musician that we ar subject to critic
practic suggest
to the young man or woman who would learn the secret of public
appear i would sai
1 look deepli into your natur qualif us everi morsel of
judgment you possess to endeavor to determin whether you ar talent
or simpli clever at music court the advic of unbias profession
musician and medit upon the difficulti lead to a success
career and do not decid to add on more musician to the world until
you ar confid of your suitabl for the work rememb that thi
moment of decis is a veri import time and that you mai be upon the
threshold of a danger mistak rememb that there ar thousand of
success and happi teacher for on success virtuoso
2 after you have determin to undertak the career of the concert
perform let noth stand in the wai of studi except the
consider of your health success with a brokendown bodi and a
shatter mind is a worthless conquest rememb that if you wish a
perman posit you must be thoroughli train in all branch of
your art
3 avoid charlatan and the kind of advertis that will bring you
notorieti at the sacrific of your selfrespect and the respect of your
best friend rememb that real worth is after all the thing that
bring endur fame
4 studi the public seek to find out what pleas it but never lower
the standard of your art read the best literatur studi pictur
travel broaden your mind acquir gener cultur
5 be care of your stage deport endeavor to do noth at the
keyboard that will emphas ani person eccentr alwai be
sincer and true to your own natur but within these limit try to make
a pleas impress
6 alwai be your own severest critic be not easili satisfi with
yourself hitch your wagon to a star let your standard of perfect be
the veri highest alwai strive to reach that standard never plai in
public a piec that you have not thoroughli master there is noth
more valuabl than public confid onc secur it is the greatest
asset an artist can possess
i have repeatedli been ask to give ten rule for practic
it is not possibl to formul ten allcomprehens rule that could
be appli in everi case but the follow suggest will be found
valuabl to mani student
1 concentr dure everi second of your practic to concentr
mean to bring all your think power to bear upon on central point
with the greatest possibl intens without such concentr noth
can be accomplish dure the practic period on hour of concentr
think is worth week of thoughtless practic it is safe to sai that
year ar be wast by student in thi countri who fail to get the
most out of their practic becaus thei do not know how to concentr
a famou thinker ha said the evid of superior geniu is the power
of intellectu concentr
2 divid your practic time into period of not more than two hour
you will find it imposs to concentr properli if you attempt to
practic more than two hour at a time do not have an arbitrari program
of practic work for thi cours is liabl to make your work
monoton for on who practic four hour and that is enough for
almost ani student on hour for pure technic work on hour for
bach and two hour for piec is to be recommend
3 in commenc your practic plai over your piec onc or twice
befor begin to memor then after work through the entir
composit pick out the more difficult passag for special attent
and reiter
4 alwai practic slowli at first thi is simpli anoth wai of
tell the pupil to concentr even after you have plai your piec
at the requir speed and with reason confid that it is correct
never fail to go back now and then and plai it at the speed at which you
learn it thi is a practic which mani virtuoso follow piec that
thei have plai time and time again befor enthusiast audienc ar
restudi by plai them veri slowli thi is the onli real wai to
undo mistak that ar bound to creep into on perform when piec
ar constantli plai in a rapid tempo
5 do not attempt to practic your whole piec at first take a small
section or even a phrase if you take a longer section than sai sixteen
bar you will find it difficult to avoid mistak of cours when the
piec is master you should have all these section so unifi that you
can plai the entir composit smoothli and without a break
6 first memor mental the section you have select for studi
and then practic it if you do not know it well enough to practic it
from memori you have not grasp it music content but ar plai
mechan
7 occasion memor backward that is take the last few measur
and learn them thoroughli then take the preced measur and
continu in thi wai until the whole is master even after you have
plai the piec mani time thi process often compel a concentr
that is benefici
8 when studi rememb that practic is simpli a mean of
cultiv habit if you plai correctli from the start you will form
good habit if you plai carelessli and faultili your plai will grow
continu wors consequ plai so slowli and correctli from the
start that you mai insur the right finger phrase tone touch
staccato legato portamento etc pedal and dynam effect if
you postpon the attain of ani of these qualiti to a later date
thei ar much more difficult to acquir
9 alwai listen while you ar plai music is intend to be heard
if you do not listen to your own plai it is veri probabl that other
peopl will not care to listen to it either
10 never attempt to plai anyth in public that you have just
finish studi when you ar through work upon a piec put it
awai to be music digest then after some time repeat the same
process and again the third time when your piec will have becom a
part of yourself

import detail in piano studi
ferruccio benvenuto busoni
the signific of the detail
some year ago i met a veri famou artist whose celebr rest upon
the wonder color glass window that he had produc he wa
consid by most of hi contemporari the greatest of all maker of
highart window hi fame had extend throughout the artist circl
of all europ a littl remark he made to me illustr the import
of detail better than anyth of which i can think at present
he said if a truli great work of art in the form of a stain glass
window should be accident shatter to littl bit on should be
abl to estim the great of the whole window by examin on of
the fragment even though all the other piec were miss
in fine piano plai all of the detail ar import i do not mean
to sai that if on were in anoth room that on could invari tell
the abil of an artist by hear him strike on note but if the note
is heard in relat to the other note in a composit it
proportion valu should be so delic and artist estim
by the highli train perform that it form part of the artist
whole
for instanc it is quit easi to conceiv of composit demand a
veri smooth run perform in which on jar or harsh note
indic faulti artist calcul upon the part of the player would
ruin the entir interpret as exampl of thi on might cite the
bach choral vorspiel nun freut euch of which i have made an
arrang and such a composit as the chopin prelud opu 28 no
3 with it run accompani in the left hand
it is often perfect in littl thing which distinguish the
perform of the great pianist from that of the novic the novic
usual manag to get the socal main point but he doe not work
for the littl niceti of interpret which ar almost invari
the defin characterist of the interpret of the real
artistthat is the perform who ha form the habit of stop at
noth short of hi highest ideal of perfect
learn to listen
there is a detail which few student observ which is of such vast
import that on is tempt to sai that the main part of success
music progress depend upon it thi is the detail of learn to
listen everi sound that is produc dure the practic period should
be heard that is it should be heard with ear open to give that sound
the intellig analysi which it deserv
anyon who ha observ close and taught extens must have
notic that hour and hour ar wast by student strum awai on
keyboard and give no more attent to the sound thei produc than
would the inmat of a deaf and dumb asylum these student all expect
to becom fine perform even though thei mai not aim to becom
virtuoso to them the piano keyboard is a kind of gymnasium attach to
a music instrument thei mai of cours acquir strong finger but
thei will have to learn to listen befor thei can hope to becom even
passabl perform
at my own recit no on in the audienc listen more attent than
i do i strive to hear everi note and while i am plai my attent is
so concentr upon the on purpos of deliv the work in the most
artist manner dictat by the compos demand and my concept of
the piec that i am littl consciou of anyth els i have also
learn that i must continu have my mind alert to opportun for
improv i am alwai in quest of new beauti and even while plai
in public it is possibl to conceiv of new detail that come like
revel
the artist who ha reach the period when he fail to be on the
outlook for detail of thi kind and is convinc that in no possibl
wai could hi perform be improv ha reach a veri danger
stage of artist stagnat which will result in the ruin of hi
career there is alwai room for improv that is the develop of
new detail and it is thi which give zest and intellectu interest
to the work of the artist without it hi public effort would becom
veri tame and unattract
self develop
in my own develop as an artist it ha been made evid to me time
and time again that success come from the care observ of
detail all student should strive to estim their own artist
abil veri accur a wrong estim alwai lead to a danger
condit if i had fail to attend to certain detail mani year ago
i would have stop veri far short of anyth like success
i rememb that when i conclud my term as professor of piano at the
new england conservatori of music i wa veri consciou of certain
defici in my style notwithstand the fact that i had been
accept as a virtuoso in europ and in america and had tour with
great orchestra such as the boston symphoni orchestra i knew better
than anyon els that there were certain detail in my plai that i
could not afford to neglect
for instanc i knew that my method of plai the trill could be
greatli improv and i also knew that i lack forc and endur in
certain passag fortun although a compar young man i wa
not deceiv by the flatteri of wellmean but incap critic who
were quit will to convinc me that my plai wa as perfect as it
wa possibl to make it everi seeker of artist truth is more wide
awak to hi own defici than ani of hi critic could possibl be
in order to rectifi the detail i have mention as well as some i have
not mention i have come to the conclus that i must devis an
entir new technic system technic system ar best when thei ar
individu speak theoret everi individu need a differ
technic system everi hand everi arm everi set of ten finger everi
bodi and what is of greatest import everi intellect is differ
from everi other i consequ endeavor to get down to the basic
law underli the subject of technic and make a system of my own
after much studi i discov what i believ to be the technic
caus of my defect and then i return to europ and for two year i
devot myself almost exclus to technic studi along the
individu line i had devis to my great delight detail that had
alwai defi me the rebelli trill the falter bravura passag
the uneven run all came into beauti submiss and with them came a
new delight in plai
find individu fault
i trust that my experi will set some ambiti piano student to
think and that thei mai be benefit by it there is alwai a wai of
correct defici if the wai can onli be found the first thing
howev is to recogn the detail itself and then to realiz that
instead of be a detail it is a matter of vast import until it ha
been conquer and brought into submiss in plai alwai note
where your difficulti seem to lie then when advis isol those
difficulti and practic them separ thi is the manner in which
all good technic exercis ar devis
your own difficulti is the difficulti which you should practic most
why wast time in practic passag which you can plai perfectli well
on player mai have difficulti in plai trill while to anoth
player of equal gener music abil trill mai be perfectli easi in
plai arpeggio howev the difficulti which prove obstacl to
the player mai be entir revers the on who could plai the trill
perfectli might not be abl under ani circumst to plai an arpeggio
with the requisit smooth and true legato demand while the
student who found the trill imposs possess the abil to run
arpeggio and cadenza with the fluenci of a forest rivulet
all technic exercis must be given to the pupil with great
discret and judgment just as poison medicin must be administ
to the patient with great care the indiscrimin give of technic
exercis mai imped progress rather than advanc the pupil simpli
becaus an exercis happen to come in a certain posit in a book of
technic exercis is no reason why the particular pupil be taught
need that exercis at that particular time some exercis which ar
not feasibl and other which ar inexpedi at a certain time mai
prove invalu later in the pupil progress
take the famou tausig exercis for instanc tausig wa a master of
technic who had few if ani equal in hi time hi exercis ar for
the most part veri ingeni and us to advanc player but when
some of them ar transpos into other kei as their compos demand
thei becom practic imposs to plai with the proper touch etc
furthermor on would be veri unlik to find a passag demand such
a technic feat in the composit of ani of the great master of the
piano consequ such exercis ar of no practic valu and would
onli be demand by a teacher with more respect for tradit than
common sens
detail of phrase and accentu
some student look upon phrase as a detail that can be postpon
until other supposedli more import thing ar accomplish the veri
music mean of ani composit depend upon the correct
understand and deliveri of the phrase which make that composit
to neglect the phrase would be about as sensibl as it would be for the
great actor to neglect the proper thought divis in the interpret
of hi line the greatest masterpiec of dramat literatur whether it
be romeo and juliet antigon la malad imaginair or the doll
hous becom nonsens if the thought divis indic by the
verbal phrase ar not carefulli determin and express
great actor spend hour and hour seek for the best method of
express the author mean no pianist of abil would think of
give less care attent to phrase how stupid it would be for
the actor to add a word that conclud on sentenc to the begin of
the next sentenc how erron then is it for the pupil to add the
last note of on phrase to the begin of the next phrase phrase is
anyth but a detail
fine phrase depend first upon a knowledg of music which enabl on
to defin the limit of the phrase and then upon a knowledg of
pianofort plai which enabl on to execut it properli phrase is
close alli to the subject of accentu and both subject ar
intim connect with that of finger without the proper finger
it is often imposs to execut certain phrase correctli gener
the accent ar consid of import becaus thei ar suppos to
fall in certain set part of given measur thu indic the meter
in instruct veri young pupil it mai be necessari to lead them to
believ that the time must be mark in a definit manner by such
accent but as the pupil advanc he must understand that the measur
divis ar insert princip for the purpos of enabl him to
read easili he should learn to look upon each piec of music as a
beauti tapestri in which the main consider is the princip
design of the work as a whole and not the invis mark thread
which the manufactur is oblig to put in the loom in order to have a
structur upon which the tapestri mai be woven
bach bach bach
in the studi of the subject of accentu and phrase it would not
be possibl for anyon to recommend anyth more instruct than the
work of johann sebastian bach the immort thringian compos wa the
masterweav of all hi tapestri have never been equal in
refin color breadth and gener beauti why is bach so valuabl
for the student thi is an easi question to answer it is becaus hi
work ar so construct that thei compel on to studi these detail
even if the student ha onli master the intricaci of the two voic
invent it is safe to sai that he ha becom a better player more
than thi bach forc the student to think
if the student ha never thought befor dure hi practic period he
will soon find that it is quit imposs for him to encompass the
difficulti of bach without the closest mental applic in fact he
mai also discov that it is possibl for him to work out some of hi
music problem while awai from the keyboard mani of the most
perplex music question and difficulti that have ever confront
me have been solv mental while i have been walk upon the street
or ly in bed at night
sometim the solut of difficult detail come in the twinkl of
an ey i rememb that when i wa a veri young man i wa engag to
plai a concerto with a larg symphoni orchestra on part of the
concerto had alwai troubl me and i wa somewhat apprehens about
it dure on of the paus while the orchestra wa plai the
correct interpret came to me like a flash i wait until the
orchestra wa plai veri loud and made an opportun to run over the
difficult passag of cours my plai could not be heard under the
tutti of the orchestra and when the time came for the proper deliveri
of the passag it wa vastli better than it would have been otherwis
i never neglect an opportun to improv no matter how perfect a
previou interpret mai have seem to me in fact i often go
directli home from the concert and practic for hour upon the veri
piec that i have been plai becaus dure the concert certain new
idea have come to me these idea ar veri preciou and to neglect
them or to consid them detail to be postpon for futur develop

earli evid of individu
it is difficult for me to discuss the subject of individu without
recollect on of the most impress and signific event of my
entir career when i wa taken to europ as a child for further studi
it wa my good fortun to meet and plai for the immort franz liszt he
seem deepli interest in my plai and with the kindli for
which he wa alwai note he gave me hi bless a kind of artist
sacrament that ha had a tremend influenc upon all my work as an
artist he laid hi hand upon my head and among other thing said
littl girl with time you will be on of us dont imit anyon
keep yourself true to yourself cultiv your individu and do not
follow blindli in the path of other
in thi on thought liszt embodi a kind of a pedagog sermon which
should be preach everi dai in all the school conservatori and
music studio of the world noth is so piti as the evid of a
strong individu crush out by an artifici educ system
which make the system itself of paramount import and the individu
of microb signific
the sign of individu mai be observ in littl folk at a veri
earli ag with some children thei ar not veri pronounc and the
child seem like hundr of other without ani particular inclin
artist or otherwis it is then that the teacher power of
divin should be brought into plai befor ani real progress can be
made the natur of the child must be studi carefulli in the case of
other children the individu is veri mark at an earli ag as a
rule the child with the mark individu is the on from whom the
most mai be expect later in life sometim thi veri individu is
mistaken for precoc thi is particularli the case with musician in
a few instanc the individu of the master ha been develop late
in life as wa the case of richard wagner whose earli individu
tendenc were toward the drama rather than music
new problem at everi step
the teacher in accept a new pupil should realiz that there at onc
aris new problem at everi step the pupil hand mind bodi and soul
mai be in realiti differ from those of everi other pupil the teacher
ha taught the individu peculiar of the hand should be carefulli
consid if the hand ha long taper finger with the finger
wide separ it will need quit differ treatment from that of
the pupil with a short compact muscular hand if the pupil mind
indic mental lethargi or a lack of the proper earli educ
train thi must be carefulli consid by the teacher
if the pupil bodi is frail and the health uncertain sure the
teacher will not think of prescrib the same work she would prescrib
for a robust energet pupil who appear never to have had a sick dai
on pupil might be abl to practic comfort for four and five hour
a dai while anoth would find her energi and interest exhaust in two
hour in fact i would consid the studi of individu the
princip care or studi of the teacher
the individu of differ virtuoso perform is veri mark
although the virtuoso aspir to encompass all stylesthat is to be
what you would call an allaround playerit is nevertheless the
individu of the player that add the addit charm to the
pianorecit you hear a great masterpiec execut by on virtuoso
and when you hear the same composit plai by anoth you will detect
a differ not of technic abil or of artist comprehens but
rather of individu rembrandt ruben and vandyk might have all
paint from the same model but the finish portrait would have been
differ and that differ would have been a reflect of the
individu of the artist
the teacher respons
again let me emphas the necess for the correct diagnosi of the
pupil individu upon the part of the teacher unless the right
work is prescrib by the teacher the pupil will rare ever surviv
artist it is much the same as with the doctor if the doctor
give the wrong medicin and the patient di sure the doctor is to
blame it make no differ whether the doctor had good intent or
not the patient is dead and that is the end of all i have littl
patienc with these peopl who have such wonder intent but who
have neither the abil courag nor willing to carri out these
intent mani teacher would like to accomplish a veri great deal for
their pupil but ala thei ar either not abl or thei neglect those
veri thing which make the teacher work a mission on of the
teacher greatest respons li in determin at first upon a
ration educ cours by divin the pupil individu
rememb that pupil ar not all like sheep to be shorn in the same
ident fashion with the same ident shear
edward macdowel individu
on of the most remark case of a pronounc music individu
wa that of the late edward macdowel who came to me for instruct
for a consider time he wa then quit youth and hi motiv
from the veri first were of the highest and noblest hi ideal were so
lofti that he requir littl stimul or urg of ani kind here it
wa necessari to studi the pupil natur veri carefulli and provid
work that would develop hi keenli artist individu i rememb
that he wa extrem fond of grieg and the mark and origin
charact of the norwegian tonepoet made a deep impress upon him he
wa poetic and love to studi and read poetri to have repress
macdowel in a harsh or didact manner would have been to have
demolish those veri characterist which in later year develop
in such astonish fashion that hi composit have a distinct
and a style all their own
it give me great pleasur to place hi composit upon my program
abroad and i find that thei ar keenli appreci by music lover in
the old world if macdowel had not had a strong individu and if
he had not permit thi individu to be develop along normal
line hi composit would not be the treasur to our art that thei
ar
develop individu through poetri
if the teacher discov a pupil with appar music talent but whose
natur ha not been develop to appreci the beauti and romant
in thi wonder world of our he will find it quit imposs to
alter the pupil individu in thi respect by work at the keyboard
alon the mundan prosaic individu who believ that the sole aim of
music studi is the acquisit of technic or the magic of digit
speed must be brought to realiz that thi is a fault of individu
which will mar hi entir career unless it is intellig correct
year and year spent in practic will not make either a musician or a
virtuoso out of on who can conceiv of noth more than how mani time
he can plai a seri of note within the beat of the metronom beat
208 time a minut
speed doe not constitut virtuos nor doe the abil to unravel
the somewhat intric keyboard puzzl of bach and brahm make in
itself fine piano plai the mind of the artist must be cultur in
fact quit as cultur as that of the compos who conceiv the music
cultur come from the observ of mani thing natur architectur
scienc machineri sculptur histori men and women and poetri i
advis aspir music student to read a great deal of poetri
i find great inspir in shakespear inspir which i know is
commun to my interpret of music masterpiec at my
concert who can remain unmov by the mysteri and psycholog of
hamlet the keen suffer and miseri of king lear the bitter hate
and reveng of othello the sweet devot of romeo and juliet the
majesti of richard iii and the fairi beauti of a midsumm night
dream in thi wonder kaleidoscop of all the human passion on can
find a world of inspir i am also intens fond of goeth hein
and alfr de musset it give me pleasur to compar them to the great
master of music shakespear i compar to brahm goeth to bach and
beethoven and hein and musset to chopin and liszt
cultiv vivac and brillianc
vivac and brillianc in plai ar larg matter of tempera
and a fluent technic i ow a great deal in thi respect to gottschalk
when he came back to america fresh from the hand of the inimit
chopin he took the most minut pain to cultiv thi characterist
in my plai chopin own plai wa mark by delicaci and an
intens that wa apart from the bravura plai of most of the artist
of hi time gottschalk wa a keen observ and he did everyth
possibl to impart thi style to me i have us the studi of czerni
liszt henselt and clementi to develop brillianc with pupil
it should be rememb that the root of all brilliant plai li in
on thingaccuraci without accuraci ani attempt at brillianc must
result in mussi it is imposs to explain these thing by mean
of book and theori rememb what goeth sai all theori is grau
mein freund all theori is foggi or hard to comprehend on can sai
fifti time as much in twenti minut as on can put in a book book
ar necessari but by no mean depend entir upon book for technic
instruct
individu who ar careless possess a trait that will serious mar
their individu as musician and artist careless is so often
taken for abandon in plai abandon is someth quit differ
and pertain to that unconsci of technic effort which onli
come to the artist after year of practic to plai with abandon and
miss a few note in thi run plai a few fals note in the next strike
the wrong bass note here and there mumbl trill and overlook the
correct phrase entir with the idea that you ar do the same
thing you have seen some great virtuoso do is simpli the superl
degre of careless
to on whose individu is mar by careless let me recommend
veri slow plai with the most minut attent to detail technic
speak czerni and bach ar of great valu in correct careless
in czerni the music structur of the composit is so clearli and
openli outlin that ani error is easili detect while in bach the
structur is so close and compact that it is difficult to make an error
without interrupt the movement of some other voic that will reveal
the error the main consider howev is person care and
it make littl differ what the studi is so long as the student
himself take great pain to see that he is right and exactli right
befor he attempt to go ahead most musician howev would sai that
bach wa the on great stone upon which our higher technic structur
must firmli stand
some individu ar so superfici and so frothi that it is difficult
to conceiv of their do anyth seriou or realli worth while it is
veri hard for the teacher to work with such a pupil becaus thei have
not realiz themselv as yet thei have not look into their live
and discern those thing which make life of most import life is
not all plai nor is it all sorrow but sorrow often doe much to
develop the musician charact to make him look into himself and
discov hi more seriou purpos thi might also be accomplish by
some such mean of selfintrospect as christian scienc although i
am not a christian scientist i am a great believ in it wonder
principl
the greatest care must be taken in develop the individu of the
superfici pupil to give them bach or brahm at the outstart would be
to irrit them thei must be led to a fond for music of a deeper
or more worthi charact by gradual step in that direct in my own
case i wa fortun in have the advic of matur and famou
musician and as a child wa given music of a seriou order onli i
have alwai been grate for thi experi at on of my first new
york concert i had the honor of have theodor thoma as first
violinist and i well rememb hi natur bent for music of a seriou
order which wa in a decid contrast to the popular music tast of
the time
the import of studi music histori
everi compos ha a pronounc individu to the experienc
musician thi individu becom so mark that he can often detect
the compos style in a composit which he ha never heard the
artist studi the individu of the compos through the studi of
hi biographi through the studi of music histori in gener and
through the analysi of individu composit
everi music student should be familiar with the intens necessari and
extrem valuabl subject of music histori how els can he becom
familiar with the person individu of the great compos the
more i know of chopin beethoven scarlatti or mendelssohn as men and
the more i know of the time in which thei live the closer i feel to
the manner in which thei would have wish their composit
interpret consid how markedli differ ar the individu of
wagner and haydn and how differ the interpret of the work of
these master should be
strauss and debussi ar also veri differ in their method of
composit strauss seem to me a tremend geniu who is invent a
new music languag as he goe debussi doe not appeal to me in the
same manner he alwai seem to be grope for music idea while with
strauss the great of hi idea is alwai evid and allcompel
in close let me sai that time experi and work ar the
moulder of all individu few of us close our dai with the same
individu which becom evid in our youth we ar either
grow better or wors all the time we rare stand still to the
musician work is the great sculptor of individu as you work and as
you think so will you be no deed no thought no hope is too
insignific to fail to influenc your natur as through work we
becom better men and women so through work do we becom better
musician carlyl ha beautifulli express thi thought in past and
present thu the latest gospel in thi world is know thy work and
do it bless is he who ha found hi work let him ask no other
blessed he ha a work a life purpos he ha found it and will
follow it

essenti of touch
ossip gabrilowitsch
modern pianofort teacher in mani instanc seem to make deliber
attempt to complic the veri simpl matter of touch in the final
analys the whole studi of touch mai be resolv into two mean of
administ forc to the keyboard i e weight and muscular
activ the amount of pressur brought to bear upon the kei depend
upon the amount of arm weight and upon the quick with which the
muscl of the hand forearm fullarm and back permit the kei to be
struck upon these two mean of administ forc must depend whatev
differenti in dynam power and tonal qualiti the player desir to
produc the variou gradat of tone which the virtuoso hand and
arm ar train to execut ar so minut that it is imposs for me to
conceiv of a scientif instrument or scale to measur them
physiologist have attempt to construct instrument to do thi but
littl of valu ha come from such experi
a rigid arm undesir
onli a compar few year ago thousand of teacher were insist
upon have their pupil keep the arm in a still even rigid condit
dure practic thi natur result in the stiffest imagin
kind of a touch and likewis in a mechan style of plai that made
what ha come to be known in later dai as tone color imposs
at thi dai the finger touch as it wa formerli known ha almost gone
out of exist by finger touch i refer to the old custom of hold
the hand and forearm almost rigid and depend upon the muscular
strength of the finger for all tonal effect in fact i so rare
emploi the finger touch except in combin with the arm touch that
it is almost an insignific factor as far as my own plai is
concern by thi the reader must not think that the train of the
finger and particularli the finger tip is to be neglect but thi
train to my mind is not so much a matter of acquir digit
strength to produc forc as to accustom the finger to strike the note
with the greatest possibl accuraci and speed thi belong rather to
the realm of technic than to that of touch and behind all technic is
the intellect of the player technic is a matter of train the finger
tip to attack and leav the kei under the absolut disciplin of the
brain touch ha a much broader and wider signific it is touch that
reveal the soul of the player
touch a distinguish characterist
touch is the distinguish characterist which make on player
music sound differ from that of anoth for it is touch that
domin the player mean of produc dynam shade or tone
qualiti i know that mani author contend that the qualiti of tone
depend upon the instrument rather than upon the perform
nevertheless i am reason confid that if i were to hear a number
of pianist plai in success upon the same instrument behind a screen
and on of these perform were to be my friend harold bauer i could
at onc identifi hi plai by hi peculiarli individu touch in
fact the train ear can identifi differ individu characterist
with almost the same accuraci that we identifi differ voic on
could never forget leschetizki touch or that of mani anoth
contemporari pianist
no matter how wonder the pianist technicthat is how rapidli and
accur he can plai passag of extraordinari difficulti it is quit
worthless unless he possess that control over hi touch which enabl
him to interpret the compos work with the right artist shade a
fine technic without the requisit touch to liber the perform
artist intellig and soul is like a gorgeou chandeli without
the light until the light ar ignit all it beauti is obscur in
dark with an excel technic and a fine touch togeth with a
broad music and gener educ and artist tempera the young
player mai be said to be equip to enter the virtuoso field
combin differ touch
as i have intim if the finger ar us exclus a terribl dry
tone must result the fullarm touch in which i experi a complet
relax of the arm from the shoulder to the finger tip is the
condit i emploi at most time but the touch i us ar combin
of the differ finger hand and arm touch these lead to myriad of
result and onli the experienc perform can judg where thei should
be appli to produc desir effect
you will observ by place your hand upon my shoulder that even with
the movement of the singl finger a muscular activ mai be detect at
the shoulder thi show how complet relax i keep my entir arm
dure perform it is onli in thi wai that i can produc the right
kind of sing tone in cantabil passag sometim i us on touch in
on voic and an entir differ touch in anoth voic the
combin ar kaleidoscop in their multipl
mechan method danger
i have never been in favor of the mani automat and mechan method
of produc touch thei ar all danger to my mind there is onli on
real wai of teach and that is through the sens of hear of the
pupil the teacher should go to the piano and produc the desir tonal
effect and the pupil should listen and watch the teacher then the
pupil should be instruct to secur a similar result and the teacher
should persever until the audibl effect is nearli the same if the
pupil work empir doe not discov the mean lead to thi
effect the teacher should call the pupil attent to some of the
physic condit lead to the result if the teacher is unabl to
plai well enough to illustr thi and to secur the right kind of
touch from hi pupil he ha no busi to be a teacher of advanc
student all the theori in the world will never lead to the proper
result
rubinstein paid littl or no attent to the theori of touch and in
fact he frequent state that he care littl about such thing but
who could hear rubinstein touch without be benefit i believ
that in teach touch the teacher should first give hi model of the
touch requir and then proce from thi posit ideal by mean of
the socal socrat method of induc the pupil to produc a similar
result through repeat question in thi wai the pupil will not be
oblig to resign hi individu as would be the case if he follow
strict technic injunct and rule
student should hear virtuoso
for the same reason it is advis for the pupil to hear mani fine
pianist he should never miss an opportun to attend the concert of
great virtuoso i can frankli sai that i have learn as much from
hear the concert of great perform as i have from ani other sourc
of educ inspir the pupil should listen intellig and
earnestli when he hear what appeal to him as a particularli fine
tonal effect he should endeavor to note the mean the pianist emploi
to produc thi effect
he must howev learn to discrimin between affect or needless
movement and the legitim mean to an end consequ upon a relax
full arm is the occasion drop of the wrist below the level of the
keyboard a few great player practic thi at a public recit and lo
and behold a verit cult of wristdropp aris and we see
student rais and lower the wrist with exagger mechan
stiff and entir ignor the import end in which thi wrist
drop wa onli an incid
method and still more method
i am continu amus at the thousand and on differ wai of
strike the kei that teacher devis and then attach with the label
method these vari contort ar after all larg a matter of
vision and have littl effect upon the real music result that the
composit demand touch as i have previous said all come down to
the question of the degre of weight appli to the keyboard and the
degre of quick with which it is appli in rapid octav and
staccato passag the hand touch is larg us thi is the touch
most depend upon local muscular activ asid from thi the
combin of muscular and weight touch almost invari obtain
dont neglect ear train
i desir to reiter that if the ideal touch is present to the
pupil mind through the medium of the ear he will be much more
success in attain the artist end requir the pupil must
realiz clearli what is good and what is bad and hi aural sens
must be continu educ in thi respect he should practic slowli
and carefulli at the keyboard until he is convinc that hi arm is at
all time relax he cannot make hi sens of touch too sensit he
should even be abl to sens the weight or upward pressur which bring
the pianofort kei back into posit after it ha been depress the
arm should feel as if it were float and should never be tens
when i am plai i do not think of the arm motion i am of cours
absorb in the composit be perform a relax arm ha becom
second natur to me it come by itself player ar rare abl to tell
just how thei produc their result there ar too mani contribut
factor even with the bestknown perform the effect differ at
differ perform it is imposs for the perform to give a
program repeatedli in ident the same manner if he did succe in
do thi hi plai would soon becom stereotyp
the teacher should from the veri begin seek to avoid stiff
and bad hand posit such as crook finger or brokenin knuckl
if these detail ar neglect the pupil is liabl to go through hi
entir music career greatli hamper i would earnestli advis all
teacher to discourag the effort of pupil to attain virtuoso height
unless thei ar convinc beyond the possibl of a doubt that the
pupil ha marvel talent the realli great perform seem to be
endow with a godgiven insight in the matter of both technic and
touch thei ar unquestion born for it thei possess the right
mental and physic capac for success no amount of train would
make a normandi drai hors that could compet with a kentucki
thoroughbr on the race cours it is a piti sight to watch student
who could not possibl becom virtuoso slave year after year befor an
ivori and eboni treadmil when if thei realiz their lack of
person qualif thei could engag in teach or in some other
profession or mercantil line and take a delight in their music as an
avoc that thei would never find in profession plai
artist interpret paramount
to some the matter of touch is of littl signific thei ar
appar born with an appreci of tonal valu that other might
work year to attain in vain those who imagin that touch is entir
a matter of finger tip ar greatli mistaken the ear is quit as
import as the organ emploi in administ the touch to the
keyboard the pianist should in realiti not think of the muscl and
nerv in hi arm nor of the ivori and eboni kei nor of the hammer
and string in the interior of the instrument he should think first and
alwai of the kind of tone he is elicit from the instrument and
determin whether it is the most appropri tonal qualiti for the
proper interpret of the piec he is plai he must of cours
spend year of hard thought and studi in cultiv thi abil to
judg and produc the right touch but the perform who is more

the real signific of technic
leopold godowski
idea upon technic often erron
it is quit imposs in a short talk to earnest music student to do
more than discuss a few of the more import point in the subject
propos it mai safe be said at the start howev that the popular
concept of technic is quit an erron on and on that deserv
correct it is highli necessari that the student should have a
correct attitud of mind regard thi matter first of all i
distinguish between what might be call mere mechan and technic
the art of piano plai as a whole seem to divid itself into three
quit distinct channel when it is consid from the educ
standpoint the first channel is that of mechan thi would natur
includ all that pertain to that branch of piano studi which ha to do
with the exercis that develop the hand from the machin
standpointthat is make it capabl of plai with the greatest
possibl rapid the greatest possibl power when power is need and
also provid it with the abil to plai those passag which becaus
of finger or unusu arrang of the piano kei ar particularli
difficult to perform
the brain side of piano studi
in the second channel we would find the studi of the technic of the art
of plai the instrument technic differ from the mechan of piano
plai in that it ha properli to do with the intellectu phase of the
subject rather than the physic it is the brain side of the studi not
the digit or the manual to the averag student who is shortsight
enough to spend hour hammer awai at the keyboard develop the
mechan side of hi work a real consciou knowledg of the great
save he could effect through technic would be a godsend technic
properli ha to do with rhythm tempo accent phrase dynam
agog touch etc
the excel of on technic depend upon the accuraci of on
understand of these subject and hi skill in appli them to hi
interpret at the keyboard mechan skill minu real technic
grasp place the player upon a lower foot than the pianoplai
machin which realli do plai all the note with all the speed and all
the power the oper demand some of these instrument inde ar
so construct that mani of the import consider that we have
place in the realm of technic ar reproduc in a surpris manner
the emot in piano plai
howev not until man invent a live soul can piano plai by
machin includ the third and vastli import channel through which we
commun the work of the master to those who would hear them that
channel is the emot or artist phase of piano plai it is the
channel which the student must expect to develop larg through hi own
inborn artist sens and hi cultiv power of observ of the
plai of master pianist it is the sacr fire commun from on
art gener to the next and modifi by the individu emot of
the perform himself
even though the perform mai possess the most highli perfect
mechan technic masteri which enabl him to plai great
masterpiec effect if he doe not possess the emot insight
hi perform will lack a peculiar subtleti and artist power that
will depriv him of becom a truli great pianist
inspir the student
exercis for the mechan side of pianofort plai abound czerni
alon wrote over on thousand opu number there have also been
valuabl attempt to provid book to assist the student in hi
technic work but it should alwai be rememb that thi depend
first of all upon understand and then upon the abil to translat
that understand to the instrument
there can never be ani exercis in the emot side of the student
work other than the entir literatur of the instrument on mai as well
try to captur the perfum of the flower as defin the requir of
the emot in pianofort plai a great deal mai be done to inspir
the student and suggest idea which mai bring him to the proper artist
appreci of a passag but it is thi veri indefin which
make the emot phase on of the most import of all attend
at the recit of artist pianist is of great help in thi
connect
the student howev mai learn a vast amount about real piano technic
and appli hi knowledg to hi plai through the medium of the proper
studi for instanc in the subject of touch alon there is a vast
store of valuabl inform which can be gain from a review of the
progress step through which thi signific phase of the subject
ha pass dure the last centuri the art of piano plai consid
apart from that of the similar instrument which preced the piano is
veri littl over on hundr year old
chang in the mechan of the instrument
dure thi time mani signific chang have been made in the
mechan of the instrument and in the method of manufactur these
chang in the natur of the instrument have in themselv doubtless had
much to do with chang in method of touch as have the natur
evolut come through countless experi made by teacher and
perform thu we mai speak of the subject of touch as be divid
into three epoch the first be that of czerni character by a
stroke touch the second be that of the famou stuttgart
conservatori character by a pressur touch and the third or new
epoch which is character by weight plai all my own plai is
base upon the last name method and i had the honor of be on of
the first to make applic of it when i commenc teach some
twenti year ago
the signific of weight plai
in thi method of plai the finger ar virtual glu to the
kei in that thei leav them the least possibl distanc in order to
accomplish their essenti aim thi result in no wast motion of ani
kind no loss of power and consequ the greatest possibl
conserv of energi in thi manner of plai the arm is so relax
that it would fall to the side if the keyboard were remov from beneath
it sinc the hand and the arm ar relax the back top of the hand is
almost on a level with the forearm
the high angular stroke which character the plai of the czerni

stiff plai is seen veri littl in these dai by mean of it the
student wa taught to deliv a blow to the keyboarda blow which
permit veri littl modif to the requir of modern
technic
in my experi as a pianist and as a teacher i have observ that
the weight touch allow the greatest possibl opportun for the proper
applic of those allimport divis of technic without which
piano plai is not onli inartist but devoid of all interest
weight plai permit noth to interfer with discrimin
phrase complic rhythmic problem the infinit subtl
variat of time for express purpos now class under the head of
agog all shade of dynam gradat in fact everyth that fall
in the domain of the artist pianist
mould the finger to the kei
in weight plai the finger seem to mould the piano kei under them
the hand and arm ar relax but never heavi the maximum of relax
result in the minimum of fatigu in legato plai for instanc the
finger rest upon the fleshi part behind the tip rather than immedi
upon the tip as thei would in passag work when the player desir to
have the effect of a string of pearl the sensat in legato plai
is that of pull back rather than strike the kei in passag where
forc is requir the sensat is that of push
much might be said of the sensibl of the finger tip as thei come
in contact with the ivori and eboni kei most everi artist ha a strong
conscious that there is a veri manifest relat between hi
emot and mental condit and hi tactil sens that is hi
highli develop sens of feel at the finger tip on the keyboard
howev the phenomena mai be explain from the psycholog
standpoint it is nevertheless true that the feel of long
yearn hope or soul anticip for instanc induc a total
differ kind of touch from that of anger resent or hate
the artist who is incap of commun hi emot to the
keyboard or who must depend upon artific to stimul emot rare
electrifi hi audienc everi concert is a test of the artist
sincer not mere an exhibit of hi prowess or hi acrobat
accomplish on the keyboard he must have some vital messag to
convei to hi audienc or els hi entir perform will prove
meaningless soulless worthless
that which is of great import to him is to have the least possibl
barrier between hi artist concept of the work he would interpret
and the sound that ar convei to the ear of hi audienc if we
obliter the emot side and depend upon artific or what might be
call in vulgar parlanc trick of the trade pianism will inevit
descend to a vastli lower level by cultiv a sensibl in touch
and emploi the technic mean which will bring the interpret
messag to the world with the least possibl obstruct we reach the
highest in the art those who would strain at gnat might contend that
with the machineri of the instrument itself interven between the
touch at the keyboard and the sound wire would make the influenc
of the emot though the tactil sens sens of touch is wholli
neglig to thi i can onli repli that the experi of the artist
and the teacher is alwai more reliabl more suscept to finer
appreci of artist valu than that of the pure theorist who
view hi problem through materi rather than spiritu ey everi

reason to suppos that the finger tip possess a similar sensibl

analyz masterpiec
katharin goodson
the natur tendenc to analyz
judg from the mischiev investig of thing in gener which
seem so natur for the small boi to make it would appear that our
tendenc to analyz thing is innat we also have innumer
opportun to observ how children to sai noth of primit
peopl struggl to constructto put thi and that togeth for the
purpos of make someth newin other word to emploi the opposit
process to analysi known as synthesi moreov it doe not demand
much philosophi to perceiv that all scientif and artist progress is
base upon these veri process of analysi and synthesi we pull
thing apart to find out how thei ar made and what thei ar made of we
put them togeth again to indic the masteri of our knowledg
the measur of musicianship is the abil to do all the analyz in
the world will not benefit the pupil unless he can give some visibl
indic of hi profici inde import as the process is it
is possibl to carri it to extrem and neglect the build process
which lead to real accomplish
the first step in analyz a new piec
a great mani of the pupil who have come to me indic a lament
neglect in an understand of the veri first thing which should have
been analyz by the preparatori teacher it is an expens process to
studi with a public artist unless the prepar ha been thoroughli
made reput natur place a higher monetari valu upon the
servic of the virtuoso and for the student to expect instruct in
elementari point in analysi is obvious an extravag the
virtuoso time dure the lesson period should be spent in the finer
studi of interpretationnot in those subject which the elementari
teacher should have complet often the teacher of an advanc pupil is
deceiv at the start and assum that the pupil ha a knowledg which
futur investig reveal that he doe not possess
for instanc the pupil should be abl to determin the gener
structur of a piec he is undertak and should be so familiar with
the structur that it becom a form of second natur to him if the
piec is a sonata he should be abl to identifi the main theme and the
secondari theme whenev thei appear or whenev ani part of them
appear inabl to do thi indic the most superfici kind of
studi
the student should know enough of the subject of form in gener to
recogn the period into which the piec is divid without thi
knowledg how could he possibl expect to studi with understand
even though he ha pass the stage when it is necessari for him to mark
off the period he should not studi a new piec without observ the
outlinesth architectur plan the compos laid down in construct
the piec it is on thing for a sir christoph wren to make the plan
of a great cathedr like st paul and quit anoth thing for him to
get master builder to carri out those plan by studi the compos
architectur plan carefulli the student will find that he is save an
immens amount of time for exampl let us consid the chopin f minor
fantasi in thi composit the main theme come three time each
time in a differ kei onc learn in on kei it should be veri
familiar in the next kei
the student should also know someth of the histori of the danc and
he should be familiar with the characterist of the differ nation
danc each nation danc form ha someth more than a rhythmit
ha an atmospher the word atmospher mai be a littl loos in it
applic here but there seem to be no other word to describ what i
mean the flavor of the spanish bolero is veri differ from the
hungarian czarda and who could confound the intox swirl of the
italian tarantella with the state air of cluni lace and silver rapier
which seem to surround the minuet the minuet by the wai is
frequent plai too fast the minuet from beethoven eighth symphoni
is a notabl exampl mani conductor have made the error of rush
through it dr han richter conduct it with the proper tempo thi
subject in itself take a tremend amount of consider and the
student should never postpon thi first step in the analysi of the
work he is to perform
the poetic idea of the piec
despit the popular impress that music is imit in the sens of
be abl to reproduc differ pictur and differ emot it is
realli veri far from it the subject of program music and illustr
music is on of the widest in the art and at the same time on of the
least definit except in case like the beethoven pastor symphoni
where the compos ha made obviou attempt to suggest rural scene
compos do not as a rule try to make either aquarel or cyclorama
with their music thei write music for what it is worth as music not as
sceneri veri often the public or some wili publish appli the titl
as in the case of the moonlight sonata or some of the mendelssohn
song without word of cours there ar some notabl except and
mani teacher mai be right in try to stimul the sluggish
imagin of some pupil with fanci stori howev when there
is a certain design in a piec which lend itself to the suggest of a
certain idea as doe for instanc the lisztwagn spin song
from the fly dutchman it is interest to work with a specif
pictur in viewbut never forget the real beauti of the piec
pure as a beauti piec of music
some piec with special titl ar notori misnam and carri no
possibl mean of definit intim what the compos intend even
some form ar mislead in their name the scherzo of chopin ar
often veri remot from the play signific of the worda
signific which is beautifulli preserv in the scherzo of
mendelssohn
studi the rhythm
a third point in analyz a new piec might be analyz the rhythm
it is on thing to understand or to comprehend a rhythm and anoth to
preserv it in actual plai rhythm depend upon the arrang of
note and accent in on or two measur which give a characterist
swing to the entir composit rhythm is an altar upon which mani
idol ar smash sometim on is inclin to regard rhythm as a kind
of sacr gift whatev it mai be it is certainli most difficult to
acquir or better to absorb a good rhythm indic a fine balanc
musicianon who know how and on who ha perfect selfcontrol all
the book studi in the world will not develop it it is a knack which
seem to come intuit or all at onc when it doe come my mean
is clear to anyon who ha struggl with the problem of plai two
note against three for at time it seem imposs but in the
twinkl of an ey the conflict rhythm appar jump into place
and thereaft the pupil ha littl difficulti with them
rhythmic swing is differ from rhythm but is alli to it as it is
alli to tempo to get the swingth impel forceth student must
have plai mani piec which have a tendenc to develop thi swing the
big waltz of moszkowski ar fine for thi if on of leschetizki
pupil had difficulti with rhythm he almost invari advis them to
go to hear the concert of that king of rhythm and danc eduard
strauss danc ar invalu in develop thi sens of
rhythmswiftmov danc like the bolero and the tarantella ar
especi help certain piec demand a particularli strict
observ of the rhythm as doe the opu 42 of chopin in which the
left hand must adher veri strictli to the vals rhythm
the analysi of phrase
the abil to see the phrase by which a composit is built clearli
and readili simplifi the studi of interpret of a new piec
wonderfulli thi of cours is difficult at first but with the proper
train the pupil should be abl to see the phrase at a glanc just
as a botanist in examin a new flower would divid it in hi mind
ey into it differ part he would never mistak the calyx for a
petal and he would be abl to determin at onc the peculiar of
each part in addit to the melod phrase the pupil should be abl
to see the metric divis which underli the form of the piec he
should be abl to tell whether the composit is on of eightmeasur
section or fourmeasur section or whether the section ar
irregular
what a splendid thing it would be if littl children at their first
lesson were taught the desir of observ melod phrase
teacher lai great stress upon hand format with the object of
get the pupil to keep the hand in a perfect conditiona condit
that is the result of a carefulli develop habit why not develop the
habit of note the phrase in the same wai why not a littl mind
format it is a great deal nearer the real music aim than the mere
digit work the most perfectli form hand in the world would be
worthless for the musician unless the mind that oper the hand ha
had a real music train
studi the harmoni
everi piano student ought to have a knowledg of harmoni but thi
knowledg should be a practic on what do i mean by a practic
knowledg of harmoni simpli thisa knowledg of harmoni which
recogn the ear as well as the ey there ar student of harmoni who
can work out some harmon problem with the skill of an expert
mathematician and yet thei never for on singl moment think of the
music their note might make thi is due to the great neglect of the
studi of eartrain in earli music educ
to be abl to recogn a chord when you see it on paper is not nearli
such an acquisit as the abil to recogn the same chord when it
is plai the student who can tell a diminish seventh or an
augment sixth at a glanc but who could not identifi the same chord
when he saw them through hi ear instead of hi ey is sever
handicap but how mani musician can do thi eartrain should be
on of the first of all studi it mai be acquir more easili in
childhood if the student is not natur gift with it and it is the
onli basi of a thorough knowledg of harmoni the piano teacher cannot
possibl find time to give suffici instruct in the subject of
harmoni at the piano lesson it demand a separ period and in most
case it is necessari and advis to have a separ teacher that is
on who ha made a specialti of harmoni
the piano itself is of cours a great help to the student in the studi
of harmoni provid the student listen all the time he is plai
few adult piano student studi string instrument such as the violin or
celloinstru which cultiv the percept of hear far more
than can the piano for thi reason all children should have the
advantag of a cours in eartrain thi should not be train for
pitch alon but for qualiti of tone as well it mai be supplement
with exercis in music dictat until the pupil is abl to write
down short phrase with eas after he ha heard them onc a pupil who
ha had such a train would make ideal materi for the advanc
teacher and becaus of the greatli develop power of the pupil would
be abl to memor quicker and make much better progress in fact
eartrain and harmoni lead to great economi of time for instanc
let us suppos that the pupil ha a chord like the follow in a
sonata
illustr
if the same chord appear again in the piec it would probabl be found
in the kei of the domin thu
illustr
it seem veri obviou that if the pupil could perceiv the harmon
relationship between these two chord he would be spare the troubl of
identifi an entir differ chord when he find the repetit of
it mere in anoth kei thi is onli on of score of instanc where
a knowledg of the harmon structur prove to be of constant
import to the student
a care analysi of touch effect
here again we find an intermin subject although there ar onli a
few princip divis into which the subject of touch might be
divid the number of differ subdivis of these best known
method of strike the kei to produc artist effect is veri
consider the artist work dai in and dai out at the keyboard will
discov some subtl touch effect which he will alwai associ with a
certain passag he mai have no logic reason for do thi other than
that it appeal to hi artist sens he is in all probabl
follow no law but that of hi own music tast and sens of hear
it is thi more than anyth els which give individu to the
plai of the differ virtuoso and make their effort so differ
from the plai of machin time and time again mechan effort
have been made to preserv all these infinit subtil and some truli
wonder machin have been invent but not until the sculptor
marbl can be made to glow with the vital of real flesh can thi be
accomplish wonder as the mechan invent ar there is alwai
someth lack
here again eartrain will benefit the pupil who is studi with a
virtuoso teacher it is imposs to show exactli how certain touch
produc certain effect the ear howev hear these effect and if
the pupil ha the right kind of persist he will work and work until
he is abl to reproduc the same effect that he ha heard then it will
be found that the touch he emploi will be veri similar to that us by
the virtuoso he ha heard it mai take week to show a certain pupil a
kind of touch the pupil with the train ear and the willing to
work might be abl to pick up the same touch and produc the same effect
after a few dai a highli develop sens of hear is of immens
valu to the student who attend concert for the purpos of promot
hi music knowledg
the respons of the teacher
the more on contempl thi subject the more on realiz the
respons of the teacher in the first year of music studi of
all the pupil who commenc in the art there ar but few who make it a
part of their live mani of those who do continu find themselv
handicap when thei reach the more advanc stage of the journei
ow to ineffici earli train at the period when their time is
the most valuabl to them thei have to take up studi which should have
been master eight or ten year befor the elementari teacher all
over the world have a big respons if thei belittl their work
with children and pine for the kind of teach which the virtuoso
attempt to do let them realiz that thei ar in a sens the foundat
of the structur and although perhap not as conspicu as the spire

progress in piano studi
josef hofmann
the question of progress in pianofort plai is on that admit of the
widest possibl discuss on is frequent ask whether the manner
of plai the pianofort ha undergon ani chang sinc the time of
hummel and if it ha advanc of what natur ar the advanc and to
what particular condit ar the advanc due johann nepomuk hummel
it will be rememb wa contemporari with beethoven and wa in
fact a kind of bridg between the old and the new he made hi dbut at
a concert given by mozart at dresden for a time he wa a kind of
assist kapellmeist to haydn and inde mani at that time thought
hi work were quit on a par with those of the great master beethoven
hummel wa a realli great virtuoso and wa note for hi remark
improvis hi style of plai wa taken as a model in hi time
and consequ we mai safe start with thi epoch by wai of exampl
what determin chang in plai
it is sometim said that the chang in the construct of the piano
have caus a differ treatment of it but thi reason is
superfici inasmuch as the structur chang of the instrument
itself ar call forth by the everincreas demand of the compos
made upon the instrument so long as the tone qualiti action and natur
of the instrument suffic for composit of the type of those of
domenico scarlatti or franoi couperin or rameau there wa littl
need for chang but as the more modern compos long for new and
more comprehens effect the pianomak kept up with their desir
and aim thu it is that after all is said and done the compos and
the compos onli is respons for the chang the literatur of the
piano determin them it is the same in the advanc of piano
technic and interpret the compos conceiv new and often
radic differ music idea these in turn demand a new manner of
interpret thi kind of evolut ha been go on continu
sinc the invent of the instrument and is go on todai onli it is
more difficult for us to see it in the present than it is to review it
in the past
the gener mental tendenc of the time the artist and cultur
influenc of the world taken as a whole have also had a conspicu
though somewhat less pronounc share in these matter sinc thei
inevit exert an influenc upon the interpret speak from a
strictli pianist point of view it is the player individu
influenc by the factor just state which is the determin element
in produc new pianist tendenc it is thu veri evid that
progress in piano plai sinc the epoch of hummel ha been enorm
the new technic and the old
you ask me what ar the essenti differ between the modern technic
and the technic of the older period it is veri difficult to discuss
thi question offhand and it is on which might better be discuss in
an articl of a differ charact on difficulti li in the
regrett tendenc of modern technic toward be a purpos in itself
judg from the manner in which some ambiti young player work
their sole aim is to becom human pianoplai machin quit without
ani real music conscious befor radic condemn thi
tendenc howev it should be rememb that it ha brought us mani
undeni advantag it cannot be doubt that we ow to the ingeni
investig of technic subject greater possibl in effect
polyphon plai economi of power and arm motion larger
particip of the mind in the acquisit of technic and numer
other praiseworthi factor in good piano plai in the olden dai
while technic exercis were by no mean absent thei were not nearli
so numer and more time wa given to the real music element in the
studi of the music composit themselv if the excel technic
idea to be found in some of the system of todai ar emploi sole
to secur real music and artist effectsthat is effect base
upon known sthetic principlesth new technic will prove valuabl and
we should be veri grate for it howev as soon as it becom an
object point in itself and succe in eclips the higher purpos
of music interpret just so soon should it be abolish if the
black charcoal sketch which the artist put upon canva to us as an
outlin show through the color of the finish paint no
masterpiec will result realli artist piano plai is an
imposs until the outlin of technic have been eras to make wai
for true interpret from the highest sens of the word there is
much more in thi than most young artist think and the remedi mai be
appli at onc by student and teacher in their daili work
technic sinc liszt
again you ask whether technic ha made ani signific advanc sinc the
time of franz liszt here again you confront me with a subject difficult
to discuss within the confin of a confer there is so much to be
said upon it a mere chang in itself doe not impli either progress or
retrogress it is for thi reason we cannot speak of progress sinc
the time of liszt to plai as liszt didthat is exactli as he did as
a mirror reflect an objectwould not be possibl to anyon unless he
were endow with an individu and person exactli like that of
liszt sinc no two peopl ar exactli alik it is futil to compar
the plai of ani modern pianist with that of franz liszt to discuss
accur the plai of liszt from the pure technic standpoint is
also imposs becaus so much of hi technic wa selfmad and also a
mere manual express of hi uniqu person and that which hi own
mind had creat he mai perhap never be equal in certain respect
but on the other hand there ar unquestion pianist todai who would
have astonish the great master with their technicsi speak
technic pure technic
definit method ar littl more than stencil
i have alwai been oppos to definit methodssocalledwhen thei
ar given in an arbitrari fashion and without the care of the
intellig teacher to adapt special need to special pupil method of
thi kind can onli be regard as a kind of music stencil or like the
di that ar us in factori to produc larg number of precis
similar object sinc art and it merit ar so strang depend
upon individu and thi includ anatom individu as well
as psycholog individu an inflex method must necessarili
have a deaden effect upon it victim
the question of whether special technic studi of an arbitrari
natur such as scale studi should be extens us is on which
ha been wide debat and i fear will be debat for year to come
let us understand first there is a wide differ between studi
and practic thei resembl each other onli in so far as thei both
requir energi and time mani sincer and ambiti student make the
great mistak of confound these two veri essenti factor of
pianist success studi and practic realli ar quit wide remov
from each other and at the same time thei ar virtual insepar
the real differ li in the amount and qualiti of the two element
practic mean a larg number of repetit with a fair amount of
attent to mere correct of note finger etc under ordinari
circumst and condit it usual mean a great sacrific of time
and a compar small invest of mental
studi on the contrari impli first of all mental activ of the
highest and most concentr type it presuppos absolut accuraci
in note time finger etc and impli the closest possibl
attent to those thing which ar gener though erron
regard as ly outsid of technic such as tonal beauti dynam
shade rhythmic matter and the like some have the happi gift of
combin practic with studi but thi is rare
henc in the question of scale exercis etc if the word studi is
meant in the true sens i can onli sai that the studi of scale is more
than necessaryit is indispens the pedagog expert of the
world ar practic unanim upon thi subject the injunct
studi appli not onli to scale but to all form of technic
disciplin which onli too often ar practic without be studi
i will not deni that mere practic as i have defin it mai bring
some littl benefit but thi benefit is gain at an enorm
expenditur of time and physic and mental exert oh the endless
leagu that ambiti finger have travel over ivori kei onli too
often thei race like automobil on a racecoursein a circleand
after have gone innumer mile and spent a tremend amount of
energi thei arriv at the same point from which thei start exhaust
and worn with veri littl to show for their work and no nearer their
real goal than when thei start the proport in which mental and
physic activ is compound determin to my mind the distinct
between practic and real studi on might also sai that the
proport in which real studi enter into the daili work of the student
determin the success of the student
the studi of detail imper
studi demand that the student shall delv into the minut detail of
hi art and master them befor he attempt to advanc onli the most
superfici student fail to do thi in these dai all of the better
train teacher insist upon it and it is hard for the pupil to skim
through on the thinnest possibl theoret ic as thei did in past
year the separ studi of embellish for instanc is decidedli
necessari especi in connect with the embellish introduc
by the writer of the earli eighteenth centuri
in the studi of embellish it is vital import for the student
to rememb on or two veri import point in connect with hi
investig on point is the understand of the natur of the
instrument for which the compos wrote when he had the embellish in
mind the instrument of the earli eighteenth centuri were character
by a tone so thin and of such short durat that the compos and
player and it should be rememb that in those dai practic all
of the great compos plai and most of the great perform were
compos had to resort to all kind of subterfug and trick to
produc the decept of a prolong tone for instanc thei had a
method of move the finger to and fro sidewai upon a kei after it
wa struck thu thei produc a sort of vibrato not unlik that of
which we have receiv an overdos in recent year from violinist and

but if we interpret it as a shake we commit a grave error we ought
never to regard it as a shake unless it is obvious an integ of
the melodi
the other point to be consid in the studi of embellish is
tast or rather let me sai fashion for the fashion of those time
which overindulg in ornament and overload everyth with it
from architectur to dress wa by no mean an insignific factor in
music the point is import becaus it involv the element of
concess which the compos voluntarili or from habit made to
the public of their dai i serious question the necess of retain
these often superabund embellish in their entireti for i
contend that we studi antiqu work on account of their music
substanc and not for the sake of gewgaw and frill which were either
induc by the imperfect of the instrument or by the vitiat tast
of time to which the compos had to yield willynilli
it is of cours a veri difficult and respons task to determin
what to retain and what to discard thi to a larg extent must depend
upon what part the ornament plai in the melodi of the composit
whether it is realli an integr part or an artifici excresc by
all mean never discard ani embellish which mai serv to emphas
the melod curv or ani on which mai add to it declamatori
charact a welleduc tast assist by experi will be a fairli
reliabl guid in thi matter howev it is hardli advis for
amateur with limit train to attempt ani home edit of thi kind
those embellish which we do regain should in all case be execut
as the compos of the piec would desir to hear them execut if he
could becom acquaint with the instrument of todai thi of cours
place the studi of ornament with the mani auxiliari music
branch which demand special and separ attent johann sebastian
bach son phillip emanuel bach realiz thi and gave year to the
proper exposit of embellish howev the student should realiz
that the studi of embellish is onli a part of the great whole and
he should not be misl into accept everi littl shake or other
littl fripperi and then magnifi it into a matter of more vital
import than the piec itself
wellmean advis
the student should form the habit of determin thing for himself he
will soon find that he will be surround with mani wellmean
advis who if thei have their own wai mai serv to confus him some
virtuoso regard their wellmean admir and entertain as the
worst penalti of the virtuoso life whether thei ar or ar not must
of cours depend upon the artist charact if he accept their
compliment and courtesi as an express of the measur of pleasur
thei deriv from hi plai he ha tacitli allow for that share
in their pleasur which is due to their power of appreci and he
can therefor onli rejoic in have provid someth worthi of it
the manner of their express the observ thei make the veri
word of their compliment will reveal quickli enough whether he
ha a case of real appreci befor him or a mere morbid mania to
hobnob with celebr or at least with peopl who by natur of their
profession work ar often compel against their own desir to hold
a more or less expos posit in the public ey if he deal with the
latter and still allow their compliment to go further than the
physic ear he must be a man of a charact so weak as to make it
doubt that he will ever produc anyth worthi of sincer and
earnest appreci more young student ar misl by blatant flatteri
than anyth els thei becom convinc that their effort ar
compar with those of the greatest artist and the desir for
improv diminish in direct ratio to the rate in which their
opinion of their own effort increas the student should continu
examin hi own work with the same acut that he would be expect
to show were he teach anoth

russia mani keyboard master
russia is old russia is vast russia is mighti eight and onehalf
million squar mile of empir not made up of coloni here and there
all over the world but on enorm territori compris nearli on
hundr and fifti million peopl of almost as mani race as on find
in the unit state that is russia although the main occup of
the peopl is the most peac of all laboragriculturerussia ha
had to deal with over a dozen war and insurrect dure a littl
more than a centuri in the same time the unit state ha had but
five war is not a thing to boast about but the condit reflect the
unrest that ha exist in the vast countri of the czar and it is not
at all unlik that thi veri unrest is respons for the mental
activ which ha character the work of so mani artist of russian
birth
although russia is on of the most vener of the european nation
and although she ha absorb other territori possess by race even
more vener than herself her advanc in art letter and music is
compar recent when scarlatti handel and bach were at their
height russia outsid of court circl wa still in a state of
serfdom tolstoi wa born as late as 1828 turgenieff in 1818 and
pushkin the halfnegro poethumorist wa born in 1799 contemporari
with these writer wa mikhail ivanovitch glinkath first of the great
modern compos of russia still later we come to wassili vereschagin
the best known of the russian painter who wa not born until 1842 it
mai thu be seen that artist develop in the modern sens of the
term ha occur dure the lifetim of the american republ reach
back into the centuri russia is on of the most ancient of nation
but consid from the art standpoint it is on of the newest
the folk song that sprang from the heart of the peopl in sad and
in joi indic the unconceal talent of the russian peopl thei
were long to sing and music becam almost as much a part of their
live as food it is no wonder then that we find among the name of the
russian pianist such celebr as anton rubinstein nichola
rubinstein essipoff siloti rachmaninoff gabrilowitsch scriabin de
pachmann safonoff sapellnikoff and mani other it seem as though the
russian must be endow by natur with those characterist which
enabl him to penetr the artist maze that surround the wonder of
music he come to music with a new talent a new gift and find first
of all a great joi in hi work much the same might be said of the
russian violinist and the russian singer mani of whom have met with
tremend success
with the music child in russia
the russian parent usual ha such a keen love for music that the child
is watch from the veri first for some indic that it mai have
music talent the parent know how much music bring into the life of
the child and he never look upon the art as an accomplish for
exhibit purpos but rather as a sourc of great joi music is
foster in the home as a part of the daili exist inde busi
is kept far from the russian firesid and the atmospher of most home
of intellig peopl is that of cultur rather than commerc if the
child is realli music the whole household is seiz with the ambit
to produc an artist in my own case i wa taught the rudiment of
music at so earli an ag that i have no recollect of ever have
learn how to begin it came to me just as talk doe with the
averag child at five i could sing some of the schumann song and some
of those of beethoven
the kind of music the russian child hear
the russian child is spare all contact with realli bad music that is
he hear for the most part either the song of the peopl or littl
select from classic or romant compos that ar select
especi with the view of cultiv hi talent he ha practic
no opportun to come in contact with ani music that might be describ
as banal america is a veri young countri and with the tension that on
see in american life on all side there come a tendenc to accept
music that mai be most charit describ as cheap veri often the
same theme found in thi music skilfulli treat would make worthi
music composit ragtim and by thi i refer to the peculiar
rhythm and not to the bad music that american have come to class under
thi head ha a peculiar fascin for me there is noth
objection about the uniqu rhythm ani more than there is anyth
iniquit about the gypsi melodi that have made such excel
materi for brahm liszt and saras the fault li in the clumsi
present of the matter and it associ with vulgar word the
rhythm is often fascin and exhilar perhap some dai some
american compos will glorifi it in the scherzo of a symphoni
in russia teacher lai great stress upon care grade mani teacher
of note have prepar carefulli grade list of piec suitabl to each
stage of advanc i understand that thi same purpos is
accomplish in america by the public of volum of the music
itself in differ grade although i have never seen ani of these
collect the russian teacher of children take great care that the
advanc of the pupil is not too rapid the pupil is expect to be
abl to perform all the piec in on grade accept befor go to
the next grade i have had numer american pupil and most of them
seem to have the fault of want to advanc to a higher step long
befor thei ar realli abl thi is veri wrong and the pupil who
insist upon such a cours will sure realiz some dai that instead of
advanc rapidli he is realli throw mani annoi obstacl directli
in hi own path
instruct book
mani juvenil instruct book ar us in russia just as in america
some teacher howev find that with pupil start at an advanc
ag it is better to teach the rudiment without a book thi matter of
method is of far greater import than the averag teacher will admit
the teacher often make the mistak of live up in the cloud with
beethoven bach chopin and brahm never realiz that the pupil is
veri much upon the earth and that no matter how grandli the teacher mai
plai the pupil must have practic assist within hi grasp the
main duti in all elementari work is to make the piano studi interest
and the teacher must choos the cours like to arous the most
interest in the particular pupil
opportun for virtuosostud in russia
it mai surpris the american student to hear that there ar realli more
opportun for him to secur public appear right here in hi own
countri than in russia in fact it is realli veri hard to get a start
in russia unless on is abl to attract the attent of the public veri
forcibl in america the standard mai not be so high as that demand in
the music circl of russia but the student ha mani chanc to plai
that would never come to him in the old world there the onli chanc
for the young virtuoso is at the conservatori concert there ar mani
music school in russia that must content themselv with privat
recit but the larger conservatori have public concert of much
import concert that demand the attend of renown artist and
compel the seriou interest of the press howev these concert ar
few and far between and onli on student out of mani hundr ha a
chanc to appear at them
on singular custom obtain in russia in refer to concert the
pianist come from some other european countri is paid more than the
local pianist for instanc although i am russian by birth i resid in
germani and receiv a higher rate when i plai in russia than doe the
resid artist in fact thi rate is often doubl the young virtuoso
in the earli stage of hi career receiv about on hundr roubl an
appear in russia while the matur artist receiv from 800 to 1000
the roubl while have an exchang valu of onli fifti cent in unit
state currenc ha a purchas valu of about on dollar in russia
why russian pianist ar fame for technic
the russian pianist is alwai fame for hi technic abil even the
mediocr artist possess that the great artist realiz that the
mechan side of piano plai is but the basi but thei would no
sooner think of try to do without that basi than thei would of
dispens with the beauti artist templ which thei build upon the
substanti foundat which technic give to them the russian pianist
have earn fame for their technic grasp becaus thei give adequ
studi to the matter everyth is done in the most solid substanti
manner possibl thei build not upon sand but upon rock for instanc
in the conservatori examin the student is examin first upon
technic if he fail to pass the technic examin he is not even
ask to perform hi piec lack of profici in technic is taken as
an indic of a lack of the right prepar and studi just as the
lack of the abil to speak simpl phrase correctli would be taken as
a lack of prepar in the case of the actor
particular attent is given to the mechan side of technic the
exercis scale and arpeggio american reader should understand that
the full cours at the lead russian conservatori is on of about
eight or nine year dure the first five year the pupil is suppos
to be build the base upon which must rest the more advanc work of
the artist the last three or four year at the conservatori ar given
over to the studi of master work onli pupil who manifest great talent
ar permit to remain dure the last year dure the first five
year the backbon of the daili work in all russian school is scale
and arpeggio all technic revert to these simpl materi and the
student is made to understand thi from hi veri entranc to the
conservatori as the time goe on the scale and arpeggio becom more
difficult more vari more rapid but thei ar never omit from the
daili work the pupil who attempt complic piec without thi
preliminari technic drill would be laugh at in russia i have been
amaz to find pupil come from america who have been abl to plai a
few piec fairli well but who wonder why thei find it difficult to
extend their music sphere when the whole troubl li in an almost
total absenc of regular daili technic work systemat pursu
through sever year
of cours there must be other technic materi in addit to
scale but the highest technic broadli speak mai be trace back to
scale and arpeggio the practic of scale and arpeggio need never be
mechan or uninterest thi depend upon the attitud of mind in
which the teacher place the pupil in fact the teacher is larg
respons if the pupil find scale practic dry or tiresom it is
becaus the pupil ha not been given enough to think about in scale
plai not enough to look out for in nuanc even touch rhythm
etc etc
modern russian influenc in music art
most musician of todai appreci the fact that in mani wai the most
modern effect sought by the compos who seek to produc extrem new
effect have frequent been anticip in russia howev on signal
differ exist between the russian with ultramodern idea and the
compos of other nation the russian advanc idea ar almost
alwai the result of a develop as were those of wagner verdi
grieg haydn and beethoven that is constant studi and investig
have led them to see thing in a newer and more radic wai in the case
of such compos as debussi strauss ravel reger and other of the
type of music philistin it will be observ that to all intent and
purpos thei start out as innov schnberg is the most recent
exampl how long will it take the world to comprehend hi messag if he
realli ha on certainli at the present time even the admir of the
bizarr in music must paus befor thei confess that thei understand the
queer utter of thi newest claimant for the palm of music
eccentr with debussi strauss and other it is differ for the
skill musician at onc recogn an astonish facil to produc
effect altogeth new and often wonderfulli fascin with reger on
seem to be impress with tremend effort and littl result strauss
howev is realli a veri great master so great that it is difficult to
get the proper perspect upon hi work at thi time it is safe to sai
that all the modern compos of the world have been influenc in on
wai or anoth by the great russian master of todai and yesterdai
tchaikovski rimskykorsakov cui glazounov rachmaninov moussorgski
arenski scriabin and other have all had a power bear upon the
music thought of the time their viril and charact have been due
to the new of the field in which thei work the influenc of the

seek origin
vladimir de pachmann
the mean of origin
origin in pianofort plai what doe it realli mean noth
more than the interpret of on real self instead of the
artifici self which tradit mistaken advisor and our own natur
sens of mimicri impos upon us seek for origin and it is gone
like a gossam shine in the morn grass origin is in on
self it is the true voic of the heart i would enjoin student to
listen to their own inner voic i do not desir to deprec teacher
but i think that mani teacher ar in error when thei fail to encourag
their pupil to form their own opinion
i have alwai sought the individu in myself when i have found him i
plai at my best i try to do everyth in my own individu wai i work
for month to invent contriv or design new fingeringsnot so much for
simplic but to enabl me to manipul the kei so that i mai
express the music thought as it seem to me it ought to be express
see my hand my fingersth flesh as soft as that of a child yet
cover muscl of steel thei ar thu becaus i have work from
childhood to make them thu
the troubl with most pupil in studi a piec is that when thei
seek individu and origin thei go about it in the wrong wai
and the result is a studi stiff hard perform let them listen to
the voic i sai to the inner voic the voic which is speak everi
moment of the dai but to which so mani shut the ear of their soul
franz lisztah you see i bow when i mention the namey never heard
franz liszt ah it wa the great liszt who listenedlisten to hi
inner voic thei said he wa inspir he wa simpli listen to
himself
machin teach
nun passen sie mal auf i abomin machin teach a certain
amount of it mai be necessari but i hate it it seem so brutalso
inartist instead of lead the pupil to seek result for himself
thei lai down law and see that these law ar obei like gendarm
it is possibl of cours by mean of systemat train to educ a
boi so that he could plai a concerto which he could not possibl
comprehend intellig until he becam at least twenti year older
but pleas tell what is the us of such a train is it artist is
it music would it not be better to train him to plai a piec which he
could comprehend and which he could express in hi own wai
of cours i am not speak now of the boi mozart the boi liszt or
other freak of natur but of the children who by machinemad method
ar made to do thing which natur never intend that thei should do
thi forc method to which some conservatori seem addict remind
on of those men who in bygon ag made a specialti of disfigur the
form and face of children to make dwarf jester and freak out of
them bah
origin the road to perman fame
origin in interpret is of cours no more import than
origin in creation see how the compos who have been the most
origin have been the on who have laid the surest foundat for
perman fame here again true origin ha been mere the highest
form of selfexpress non vero when the compos ha sought
origin and contriv to get it by purpos take outofthewai
method what ha he produc noth but a horribl shama structur
of card which is destroi by the next wind of fashion
other compos write for all time thei ar origin becaus thei
listen to the littl inner voic the true sourc of origin it is
the same in architectur style in architectur ar evolv not
creat and whenev the architect ha striven for bizarr effect he
build for on decad onli the architect who build for all time ar
differ and yet how unlik how individu how origin is the work
of on great architect from that of anoth
the most origin compos
the most origin of all compos at least as thei appear to me is
johann sebastian bach perhap thi is becaus he is the most sincer
next i should class beethoven that great mountain peak to whose height
so few ever soar then would come in order liszt brahm schumann
chopin weber and mendelssohn schumann more origin than chopin ye
at least so it seem to me that is there is someth more
distinct someth more indic of a great individu speak
a new languag
compar these men with compos of the order of abt steibelt
thalberg and donizetti and you will see at onc what i mean about
origin be the basi of perman art for over twenti year my
great fond for mineralog and for gem led me to neglect in a
measur the develop of the higher work of these compos but i
have realiz my error and have been work enorm for year to
attain the technic which their work demand some year ago i felt that
technic develop must ceas at a certain ag thi is all idioci i
feel that i have now mani time the technic i have ever had befor and i
have acquir it all in recent year
selfhelp the secret of mani success
no on could possibl believ more in selfhelp than i the student who
goe to a teacher and imagin that the teacher will cast some magic
spell about him which will make him a musician without work ha an
unpleas surpris in store for him when i wa eighteen i went to
dach at the vienna conservatori he bade me plai someth i plai
the rigoletto paraphras of liszt dach comment favor upon my
touch but assur me that i wa veri much upon the wrong track and that
i should studi the woltemperirt klavier of bach he assur me that
no music educ could be consid complet without an intim
acquaint with the bach fugu which of cours wa most excel
advic
consequ i secur a copi of the fugu and commenc work upon
them dach had told me to prepar the first prelud and fugu for the
follow lesson but dach wa not acquaint with my method of studi
he did not know that i had master the art of concentr so that i
could obliter everi suggest of ani other thought from my mind
except that upon which i wa work he had no estim of my youth
zeal and intens he did not know that i could not be satisfi unless
i spent the entir dai work with all my artist might and main
soon i saw the wonder design of the great master of eisenach the
architectur of the fugu becam plainer and plainer each subject
becam a friend and each answer likewis it wa a great joi to observ
with what marvel craftsmanship he had built up the wonder
structur i could not stop when i had memor the first fugu so i
went to the next and the next and the next
a surpris teacher
at the follow lesson i went with my book under my arm i request
him to name a fugu he did and i place the close book on the rack
befor me after i had finish plai he wa dumfound he said you
come to me to take lesson you alreadi know the great fugu and i have
taught you noth think that i would find chopin more difficult to
memor he suggest that i learn two of the etud i came at the
follow lesson with the entir twentyfour memor who could
withstand the allur charm of the chopin etud who could resist the
temptat to learn them all when thei ar onc commenc
an actor learn page after page in a few dai and why should the
musician go stumbl along for month in hi endeavor to learn
someth which he could master in a few hour with the proper interest
and the burn concentr without which all music studi is a farc
it wa thu dure my entir cours with dach he would suggest the
work and i would go off by myself and learn it i had practic no
method each page demand a differ method each page present
entir new and differ technic idea
deep thought necessari
as a rule piano student do not think deepli enough thei skim over the
realli difficult thing and no amount of persuas will make them
believ some veri simpl thing difficult take the scale of c major
for instanc thi scale is by far the most difficult of all to plai it
with true legato at ani desir degre of forc or speed in ani
desir rhythm and with ani desir touch is on of the most difficult
achiev in all music yet the young pupil will liter turn up
hi nose at the scale of c major and at the same time claim that he is
perfectli compet to plai a beethoven sonata
the scale of c should be learn step by step until the practic habit
ar so form that thei will reign suprem while plai all the other
scale thi is the wai to secur resultsgo deep into thing pearl
lie at the bottom of the sea most pupil seem to expect them float
upon the surfac of the water thei never float and the on who would
have hi scale shine with the beauti of splendid gem must first dive
deep for the gem
but what is the us of sai all thi to tell it to young pupil
seem to be a wast of word thei will go on make their mistak and
ignor the advic of their teacher and mentor until the great
teacher of allexperienceforc them to dive for the hidden rich
take time to do thing well
everi pianist advanc at a rate commensur with hi person
abil some pianist ar slow in develop other with wonder
natur gift go ahead veri quickli the student will see some pianist
make wonder progress and will sometim imit him without give
the time or effort to studi that the other pianist ha given the artist
will spend month upon a chopin vals the student feel injur if he
cannot plai it in a dai
look i will plai the wonder nocturn of chopin in g opu no 2
the legato third seem simpl ah if i could onli tell you of the year
that ar behind those third the human mind is peculiar in it method
of master the movement of the finger and to get a great
masterpiec so that you can have suprem control over it at all time
and under all condit demand a far greater effort than the ordinari
nonprofession music lover can imagin

as miracul as those which put the heaven into be the note in
composit of thi kind ar not there by ani rule of man thei come
through the ever mystifi sourc which we call inspir each note
must bear a distinct relat to the whole
an artist in jewel in make a wonder work of art doe not toss hi
jewel togeth in ani haphazard wai he often ha to wait for month to
get the right rubi or the right pearl or the right diamond to fit in
the right place those who do not know might think on gem just like
anoth but the artist know he ha been look at gem examin
them under the microscop there is a mean in everi facet in everi
shade of color he see blemish which the ordinari ey would never
detect
final he secur hi jewel and arrang them in some artist form
which result in a masterpiec the public doe not know the reason why
but it will instantli realiz that the work of the artist is in some
mysteri wai superior to the work of the bungler thu it is that the
mind of the compos work spontan in select the music jewel
for the diadem which is to crown him with fame dure the process of
inspir he doe not realiz that he is select hi jewel with
lightn rapid but with a highli cultiv artist judgment when
the music jewel ar collect and assembl he regard the work as a
whole as the work of anoth he doe not realiz that he ha been
go through the process of collect them schubert fail to
recollect some of hi own composit onli a few dai after he had
written them
someth no on can teach
now the difficulti with student is that thei do not take time to
polish the jewel which the compos have select with such keen
sthetic discern thei think it enough if thei mere succe in
plai the note how horribl a machin can plai the note but there
is onli on machin with a soul and that is the artist to think that an
artist should plai onli the note and forget the glori of the
inspir which came in the compos mind dure the moment of
creation
let me plai the d flat chopin nocturn for you pleas notic how the
note all bear a relat to each other how everyth is in right
proport do you think that came in a dai ah my friend the
polish of those jewel took far longer than the polish of the
kohinoor yet i have heard young girl attempt to plai thi piec for
meexpect approb of cours and i am certain that thei could
not have practic upon it more than a year or so thei evid think

the best teacher
thei plai just as their teacher have told them to plai which is of
cours good as far as it goe but thei stop at that and no worthi
teacher expect hi pupil to stop with hi instruct the best teacher
is the on who incit hi pupil to penetr deeper and learn new
beauti by himself a teacher in the highest sens of the word is not a
mint coin pupil as it were and put the same stamp of worth upon
each pupil
the great teacher is an artist who work in men and women everi pupil
is differ and he must be veri quick to recogn these differ
he should first of all teach the pupil that there ar hundr of thing
which no teacher can ever hope to teach he must make hi pupil keenli
alert to thi there ar hundr of thing about my own plai which
ar virtual imposs to teach i would not know how to convei them
to other so that thei might be intellig learn such thing i
have found out for myself by long and labori experiment the
control of my fifth finger in certain finger present endless
problem which could onli be work out at the keyboard such thing
give an individu to the pianist art someth which cannot be
copi
have you ever been in a foreign art galleri and watch the copyist
try to reproduc the work of the master have you ever notic that
though thei get the form the design and even the color and also that
with all these resembl there is someth which distinguish the
work of the master from the work of the copyist someth so wonder
that even a child can see it you wonder at thi pourquoi no on can
learn by copi the secret the master ha learn in creat
the basi of great
here we have a figur which bring out veri clearli the real mean of
origin in piano plai and at the same time indic how everi
pupil with or without a teacher should work for himself why wa the
great liszt greater than ani pianist of hi time simpli becaus he
found out certain pianist secret which czerni or ani of liszt
teacher and contemporari had fail to discov
why ha godowskyach godowski der ist wirklich ein grosser
talenthow ha he attain hi wonder rank becaus he ha work
out certain contrapunt and technic problem which place him in a
class all by himself i consid him the greatest master of the
mysteri of counterpoint sinc the heydai of classic polyphoni why
doe busoni produc inimit result at the keyboard simpli becaus
he wa not satisfi to remain content with the knowledg he had
obtain from other
thi then is my life secretwork unend work i have no other
secret i have develop myself along the line reveal to me by my
inner voic i have studi myself as well as my art i have learn to
studi mankind through the scienc and through the great literari
treasur you see i speak mani languag fluentli i have step
apac with the crowd i have drunk the bitter and the sweet from the
chalic of life but rememb i have never stop and todai i am
just as keenli interest in my progress as i wa mani year ago as a
youth the new repertoir of the work of liszt and brahm and other
compos demand a differ technic a bigger technic what exquisit

acquir the requisit technic
the preserv of on individu in plai is perhap on of
the most difficult and at the same time on of the most essenti task
in the studi of the pianofort the kind of technic studi that pass
the student through a certain process appar destin to make him
as much like hi predecessor as possibl is hardli the kind of technic
need to make a great artist technic abil after all is said and
done depend upon noth more than physiolog correct motion
appli to the artist need of the masterpiec to be perform it
impli a clear understand of the essenti in bring out the
compos idea the pupil must not be confus with inaccur
think for instanc we commonli hear of the wrist touch more
pupil have been hinder through thi clumsi terminolog than i should
care to estim there cannot be a wrist touch sinc the wrist is
noth more than a wonder natur hing of bone and muscl with the
pupil mind center upon hi wrist he is more than like to stiffen
it and form habit which can onli be remov with much difficulti by the
teacher thi is onli an instanc of on of the loos express with
which the terminolog of technic is encumb when the pupil come to
recogn the wrist as a condit rather than a thing he will find
that the matter of the tight cramp wrist will ceas to have it
terror in fact as far as touch itself is concern the motion of the
arm as a whole is vastli more import than that of the wrist the
wrist is mere part of the apparatu which commun the weight of
the arm to the keyboard
innov should be pianist
in my opinion the technic need of the piano ar like to be far
better understood by the virtuoso pianist than by on who ha never been
through the experi which lead to the concert platform pleas do
not infer that i would sai that all teacher should be virtuoso
pianist i am refer particularli to the maker of method i am
continu confront in my teach with all manner of absurd idea in
piano technic for instanc on pupil will come and exhibit an exercis
which requir her to press hard upon the keyboard after the note is
struck just why there should be thi addit wast of nerv forc
when it can have no possibl effect upon the depress kei i have never
been abl to find out there is enough nervou energi expend in
pianofort studi as it is without exact ani more from the pupil
pupil ar frequent carri awai with some technic trick of thi
kind like a child with a new toi thei do these thing without ever
consult their own judgment
the whole idea of technic then is to achiev a posit through
consciou effort where on mai dispens with consciou effort not
until thi can be accomplish can we hope for real selfexpress in
plai noth is so odiou as the obtrus of technic in ani work of
art technic is the trelli conceal beneath the foliag and the
blossom of the bower when the artist is realli great all idea of
technic is forgotten he must be absorb by the sheer beauti of hi
music messag hi express of hi music self in listen to
rubinstein or to liszt on forgot all idea of technic and it must be so
with all great artist in everi branch of art in everi ag what we
claim when we attend a recit is the individu artist unrestrain by
mechan bond
veri few of the great master of pianofort plai have delv veri
deepli into the technic pedagog side of their art as for instanc
have tausig ehrlich or joseffi all of whom have produc remark
work on technic liszt contribut to the technic of the instrument
wa made through hi piec not through exercis hi contribut to
the lebert and stark stuttgart conservatori method consist of two
wellknown concert studi person i am oppos to set method
that is those that pretend to teach the pupil factorywis of what
valu is the teacher if he is not to appli hi knowledg with the
discret that come with experi
depp influenc to thi dai is far more theoret than practic
thi doe not impli that depp did not evolv some veri us idea in
pianofort work all of present technic is a common heritag from mani
investig and innov pianofort teach as a matter of fact
is on of the most difficult of all task it is easi to teach it along
convent cut and dri method line but the teacher of real
import ar those who have the abil the gift the inclin and
the experi to make a brand new method for everi pupil
in order to develop the mean to commun on messag through on
art with the greatest effect there must be a masteri of the
delic balanc between natur tendenc and disciplin if the
student is subject to too much disciplin stiff angular result mai
be expect if the student is permit to plai with the flabbi
loos which some confus with natur relax characterless
plai must invari result the great desideratum is the fine
equilibrium between natur and disciplin thi mai seem an unnecessari
observ to some but mani student never seem to be abl to strike
the happi medium between march over the kei like a regiment of
wooden soldier or crawl over them like a lot of spineless
caterpillar
avoid machinelik plai
there is a certain someth which defin the individu of the
player and it seem well nigh imposs to sai just what thi
someth is let us by all mean preserv it imagin the futur of
music if everi piec were to be plai in the selfsam wai by everi
player like a seri of ordinari piano plai machin the remark
apparatu for record the plai of virtuoso and then reproduc
it through a mechan contriv is somewhat of a revel to the
pianist who tri it for the first time in the record of the plai
of artist whose interpret ar perfectli familiar to me there
still remain unquest mark of individu sometim these mark
ar small shortcom but which nevertheless ar so slight that thei
do no more than give charact look at a paint by van dyke and then
at on upon a similar subject by rembrandt and you will realiz how
these littl characterist influenc the whole outward aspect of an
art work both van dyke and rembrandt were dutchmen and in a sens
contemporari thei us pigment and brush canva and oil yet the
masterpiec of each ar readili distinguish by ani on slightli
familiar with their style it is precis the same with pianist all
of us have arm finger muscl and nerv but what we have to sai
upon the keyboard should be an express of our own mind not a
replica of some stereotyp model
when i listen to the first record of my own plai i heard thing
which seem unbeliev to me wa i after year of public plai
actual make mistak that i would be the first to condemn in ani on
of my own pupil i could hardli believ my ear and yet the
unrel machin show that in some place i had fail to plai both
hand exactli togeth and had been guilti of other error no less
heinou becaus thei were trifl i also learn in listen to my
own plai as reproduc that i had unconsci brought out certain
nuanc emphas differ voic and emploi special accent
without the conscious of have done so altogeth it made a most
interest studi for me and it becam veri clear that the person
of the artist must permeat everyth that he doe when hi technic is
suffici great it permit him to speak with fluenci and
selfexpress enhanc the valu of hi work a thousandfold
broad understand necessari
it would be a great mistak for the student to imagin that by mere
acquir finger dexter and a familiar with a certain number of
piec he mai consid himself profici there is vastli more to
pianoplai than that he must add to hi digit abil and hi
repertoir and comprehens grasp of the principl of music itself
the pupil should strive to accomplish as much as possibl through mental
work the old idea of attempt to plai everi singl studi written by
czerni or cramer or the other prolif writer of studi is a huge
mistak a judici select from the work of these pedagog
writer is desir but certainli not all of them thei ar at best
onli the materi with which on must work for a certain aim and that
aim should be high artist result it should be realiz by all
student and teacher that thi same studi materi excel in
itself mai actual produc bad result if not properli practic i
have repeatedli watch student practic industri but becom
wors and wors and actual cultiv fault rather than approach
perfect the student must alwai rememb that hi finger ar onli
the outward organ of hi inner conscious and while hi work mai be
mechan in part he should never think mechan the smallest
technic exercis must have it own direct it own aim noth
should be done without some definit purpos in view the student should
have point out to him just what the road he must travel is and where
it lead to the ideal teacher is the on who give the pupil someth
to take home and work out at home not the on who work out the
student lesson for him in the class room the teacher greatest
mission is to rais the conscious of the pupil until he can
appreci hi own power for develop an idea
freedom from convent
oh the horror of the convent the absolut right the human
machin who cannot make an error the balanc between the frigidli
correct and the abomin loos is a most difficult on to maintain it
is of cours desir that the young student pass through a certain
period of strict disciplin but if thi disciplin succe in make
an automaton of what earthli us is it is it realli necessari to
instruct our littl folk to think that everyth must be done in a
cut and dri manner take the simpl matter of time for instanc
listen to the plai of most young pupil and you will hear noth but
a kind of railroad train rhythm everi measur bump along precis
like the last on the pupil ha been taught to observ the bar sign
like stone wall partit the whole piec off into section the
result as a whole is too aw to describ as a matter of fact the bar
sign necessari as thei ar as guidepost when we ar learn the
element of notat ar often the mean of lead the poorli train
pupil to a wholli erron interpret for instanc in a passag
like the follow from beethoven f minor sonata opu 2 no 1
dedic to joseph haydn beethoven idea must have been the
follow
illustr
befor it wa divid into measur by bar line as now found print
illustr
the troubl with the pupil in plai the abov is that he seem
inclin to observ the bar line veri carefulli and lose all idea of
the phrase as a whole music should be studi by phrase not by
measur in studi a poem you strive first of all to get the poet
mean as express in hi phrase and in hi sentenc you do not try
to mumbl a few word in an arbitrari manner the pupil who never get
over the habit of plai in measur who never see the compos
messag as a whole rather than in littl segment can never plai
artist mani student fail to realiz that in some piec it is
actual mislead to count the beat in the measur the rhythm of the
piec as a whole is often mark by a seri of measur and on must
count the measur as unit rather than the note in the measur for
instanc the follow section from a chopin vals opu 64 no 1
sometim call the minut vals mai best be count by count
the measur thu

everi pupil know that the first beat in each ordinari measur of
fourquart time carri a strong accent the third beat the next
strongest and the second and fourth beat still weaker accent in a
seri of measur which mai be count in four it will be found that
the same arrang often prevail the pupil will continu meet
opportun to studi hi work along broader line and the wonder
part of it all is that music contain so much that is interest and
surpris that there need be no end to hi investig everi page

essenti of artist plai
s v rachmaninoff
form the proper concept of a piec
it is a seemingli imposs task to defin the number of attribut of
realli excel pianofort plai by select ten import
characterist howev and consid them carefulli on at a time
the student mai learn much that will give him food for thought after
all on can never tell in print what can be commun by the live
teacher in undertak the studi of a new composit it is highli
import to gain a concept of the work as a whole on must
comprehend the main design of the compos natur there ar
technic difficulti which must be work out measur by measur but
unless the student can form some idea of the work in it larger
proport hi finish perform mai resembl a kind of music
patchwork behind everi composit is the architectur plan of the
compos the student should endeavor first of all to discov thi
plan and then he should build in the manner in which the compos would
have had him build
you ask me how can the student form the proper concept of the work
as a whole doubtless the best wai is to hear it perform by some
pianist whose author as an interpret cannot be question howev
mani student ar so situat that thi cours is imposs it is also
often quit imposs for the teacher who is busi teach from
morn to night to give a render of the work that would be
absolut perfect in all of it detail howev on can gain
someth from the teacher who can by hi geniu give the pupil an
idea of the artist demand of the piec
if the student ha the advantag of hear neither the virtuoso nor the
teacher he need not despair if he ha talent talent ah that is the
great thing in all music work if he ha talent he will see with the
ey of talentthat wonder forc which penetr all artist
mysteri and reveal the truth as noth els possibl can then he
grasp as if by intuit the compos intent in write the
work and like the true interpret commun these thought to hi
audienc in their proper form
technic profici
it goe without sai that technic profici should be on of the
first acquisit of the student who would becom a fine pianist it is
imposs to conceiv of fine plai that is not mark by clean
fluent distinct elast technic the technic abil of the
perform should be of such a natur that it can be appli immedi
to all the artist demand of the composit to be interpret of
cours there mai be individu passag which requir some special
technic studi but gener speak technic is worthless unless
the hand and the mind of the player ar so train that thei can
encompass the princip difficulti found in modern composit
in the music school of russia great stress is laid upon technic
possibl thi mai be on of the reason why some of the russian pianist
have been so favor receiv in recent year the work in the lead
russian conservatori is almost entir under supervis of the
imperi music societi the system is elast in that although all
student ar oblig to go through the same cours special attent is
given to individu case technic howev is at first made a matter
of paramount import all student must becom technic
profici none ar excus it mai be interest to hear someth of
the gener plan follow in the imperi music school of russia the
cours is nine year in durat dure the first five year the
student get most of hi technic instruct from a book of studi by
hanon which is us veri extens in the conservatori in fact
thi is practic the onli book of strictli technic studi
emploi all of the studi ar in the kei of c thei includ scale
arpeggio and other form of exercis in special technic design
at the end of the fifth year an examin take place thi
examin is twofold the pupil is examin first for profici in
technic and later for profici in artist playingpiec
studi etc howev if the pupil fail to pass the technic
examin he is not permit to go ahead he know the exercis in
the book of studi by hanon so well that he know each studi by number
and the examin mai ask him for instanc to plai studi 17 or 28 or
32 etc the student at onc sit at the keyboard and plai
although the origin studi ar all in the kei of c he mai be
request to plai them in ani other kei he ha studi them so
thoroughli that he should be abl to plai them in ani kei desir a
metronom test is also appli the student know that he will be
expect to plai the studi at certain rate of speed the examin
state the speed and the metronom is start the pupil is requir
for instanc to plai the e flat major scale with the metronom at 120
eight note to the beat if he is success in do thi he is mark
accordingli and other test ar given
person i believ thi matter of insist upon a thorough technic
knowledg is a veri vital on the mere abil to plai a few piec
doe not constitut music profici it is like those music box
which possess onli a few tune the student technic grasp should be
allembrac
later the student is given advanc technic exercis like those of
tausig czerni is also veri deservedli popular less is heard of the
studi of henselt howev notwithstand hi long servic in
russia henselt studi ar so beauti that thei should rather be
class with piec like the studi of chopin
proper phrase
an artist interpret is not possibl if the student doe not know
the law underli the veri import subject of phrase
unfortun mani edit of good music ar found want in proper
phrase mark some of the phrase sign ar erron appli
consequ the onli safe wai is for the student to make a special
studi of thi import branch of music art in the olden dai phrase
sign were littl us bach us them veri sparingli it wa not
necessari to mark them in those time for everi musician who count
himself a musician could determin the phrase as he plai but a
knowledg of the mean of defin phrase in a composit is by no
mean allsuffici skill in execut the phrase is quit as
import the real music feel must exist in the mind of the
compos or all the knowledg of correct phrase he mai possess will be
worthless
regul the tempo
if a fine music feel or sensit must control the execut
of the phrase the regul of the tempo demand a kind of music
abil no less exact although in most case the tempo of a given
composit is now indic by mean of the metronom mark the
judgment of the player must also be brought frequent into requisit
he cannot follow the tempo mark blindli although it is usual unsaf
for him to strai veri far from these allimport music signpost
the metronom itself must not be us with close ey as we should
sai it in russia the player must us discret i do not approv of
continu practic with the metronom the metronom is design to set
the time and if not abus is a veri faith servant howev it
should onli be us for thi purpos the most mechan plai
imagin can proce from those who make themselv slave to thi
littl music clock which wa never intend to stand like a ruler
over everi minut of the student practic time
charact in plai
too few student realiz that there is continu and marvel
opportun for contrast in plai everi piec is a piec unto itself
it should therefor have it own peculiar interpret there ar
perform whose plai seem all alik it is like the meal serv in
some hotel everyth brought to the tabl ha the same tast of
cours a success perform must have a strong individu and all
of hi interpret must bear the mark of thi individu but at
the same time he should seek varieti constantli a chopin ballad must
have quit a differ interpret from a scarlatti capriccio there
is realli veri littl in common between a beethoven sonata and a liszt
rhapsodi consequ the student must seek to give each piec a
differ charact each piec must stand apart as possess an
individu concept and if the player fail to convei thi impress
to hi audienc he is littl better than some mechan instrument
josef hofmann ha the abil of invest each composit with an
individu and characterist charm that ha alwai been veri delight
to me
the signific of the pedal
the pedal ha been call the soul of the piano i never realiz what
thi meant until i heard anton rubinstein whose plai seem so
marvel to me that it beggar descript hi masteri of the pedal
wa noth short of phenomen in the last movement of the b flat
minor sonata of chopin he produc pedal effect that can never be
describ but for ani on who rememb them thei will alwai be
treasur as on of the greatest of music joi the pedal is the studi
of a lifetim it is the most difficult branch of higher pianofort
studi of cours on mai make rule for it us and the student should
carefulli studi all these rule but at the same time these rule mai
often be skilfulli broken in order to produc some veri charm
effect the rule repres a few known principl that ar within the
grasp of our music intellig thei mai be compar with the planet
upon which we live and about which we know so much beyond the rule
howev is the great universeth celesti system which onli the
telescop artist sight of the great musician can penetr thi
rubinstein and some other have done bring to our mundan vision
undreamtof beauti which thei alon could perceiv
the danger of convent
while we must respect the tradit of the past which for the most
part ar veri intang to us becaus thei ar onli to be found in
book we must nevertheless not be bound down by convent
iconoclasm is the law of artist progress all great compos and
perform have built upon the ruin of convent that thei themselv
have destroi it is infinit better to creat than to imit
befor we can creat howev it is well to make ourselv familiar
with the best that ha preced us thi appli not onli to
composit but to pianofort plai as well the master pianist
rubinstein and liszt were both marvel broad in the scope of their
knowledg thei knew the literatur of the pianofort in all it
possibl branch thei made themselv familiar with everi possibl
phase of music advanc thi is the reason for their gigant
promin their great wa not the hollow shell of acquir
technic thei knew oh for more student in these dai with the genuin
thirst for real music knowledg and not mere with the desir to
make a superfici exhibit at the keyboard
real music understand
i am told that some teacher lai a great deal of stress upon the
necess for the pupil learn the sourc of the compos
inspir thi is interest of cours and mai help to stimul a
dull imagin howev i am convinc that it would be far better
for the student to depend more upon hi real music understand it
is a mistak to suppos that the knowledg of the fact that schubert wa
inspir by a certain poem or that chopin wa inspir by a certain
legend could ever make up for a lack of the real essenti lead to
good pianofort plai the student must see first of all the main
point of music relationship in a composit he must understand what
it is that give the work uniti cohes forc or grace and must
know how to bring out these element there is a tendenc with some
teacher to magnifi the import of auxiliari studi and minim the
import of essenti thi cours is wrong and must lead to
erron result
plai to educ the public
the virtuoso must have some far greater motiv than that of plai for
gain he ha a mission and that mission is to educ the public it is
quit as necessari for the sincer student in the home to carri on thi
educ work for thi reason it is to hi advantag to direct hi
effort toward piec which he feel will be of music educ
advantag to hi friend in thi he must us judgment and not overstep
their intellig too far with the virtuoso it is somewhat differ
he expect and even demand from hi audienc a certain grade of
music tast a certain degre of music educ otherwis he would
work in vain if the public would enjoi the greatest in music thei must
hear good music until these beauti becom evid
it would be useless for the virtuoso to attempt a concert tour in the
heart of africa the virtuoso is expect to give hi best and he
should not be critic by audienc that have not the mental capac
to appreci hi work the virtuoso look to the student of the world
to do their share in the educ of the great music public do not
wast your time with music that is trite or ignobl life is too short
to spend it wander in the barren sahara of music trash
the vital spark
in all good pianofort plai there is a vital spark that seem to make
each interpret of a masterpiecea live thing it exist onli for
the moment and cannot be explain for instanc two pianist of equal
technic abil mai plai the same composit with on the plai is
dull lifeless and sapless with the other there is someth that is
indescrib wonder hi plai seem fairli to quiver with life

i can never thank my mother enough for the splendid start she gave me
in my earli music life she wa a wonder woman and a verit
geniu as a teacher see i have here todai on my piano a copi of the
schumann sonata in f sharp minor which she herself us and which she
plai with a feel i have never heard equal there is on thing in
particular for which i am everlastingli grate to her befor i wa
taught anyth of note or of the piano keyboard she took me asid on
dai and explain in the simpl and beauti tongu which onli a mother
emploi in talk to her child the wonder natur relationship of
tone us in make music whether thi wa an inspir an
intuit or a carefulli thought out plan for my benefit i cannot
tell but my mother put into practic what i have sinc come to consid
the most import and yet the most neglect step in the educ of
the child the fault li in the fact that most teacher at the start do
not teach music rather music notat and the peculiar of the
instrument
noth could possibl be more stultifi to the music instinct of
the child for instanc the plan gener pursu is to let the child
grope over the white kei of the piano keyboard and plai exercis in
the scale of c until he begin to feel that the whole music world
li in the scale of c with the scale of f and g as the frontier the
kei of f sharp b d flat and other ar look upon as tremend
difficult and the child mind reason with it own peculiar logic that
these kei be so much less us must of cours be less import
the black kei upon the keyboard ar a terra incognita consequ
at the veri start the child ha a radic incorrect view of what music
realli is
befor notat existedbefor keyboard were inventedpeopl sang
befor a child know anyth of notat or a keyboard it sing it is
follow it natur music instinct notat and keyboard ar
simpli symbol of musiccag in which the beauti bird is caught
thei ar not music ani more than the alphabet is literatur
unfortun our system of music symbol and the keyboard itself ar
veri complex for the young child it is as difficult as ar calculu and
algebra for hi older brother as a matter of fact the kei of f sharp
b and d flat major etc ar onli difficult becaus fate ha made them
so it would have serv the music purpos just as well if the pitch
of the instrument emploi had been adjust so that what is now f
sharp would be the kei of c major that howev would not have
simplifi matter and we have to receiv our long establish music
notat until we can exchang it for a better on
at a veri earli ag i wa taken to franz liszt by my mother liszt
immedi perceiv my natur talent and strongli advis my mother
to continu my music work at the same time he said as a child i wa
expos to critic as a wunderkind prodigi through the ignor of
my parent long befor i wa properli prepar to meet the inevit
consequ of public appear thi did incalcul damag to me
let your child be spare such a fate my own experi wa disastr
do not let your son appear in public until he is a matur artist
my first teacher loui khler wa an artist and a great artist but
he wa an artistteach rather than an artistpianist compar with
mani of hi contemporari hi plai suffer immens but he made
an art of teach as few other men have done he did not plai for hi
pupil to ani extent nor did he ask them to imit him in ani wai hi
plai wa usual confin to gener illustr and suggest
by these mean the individu of hi pupil wa preserv and
permit to develop so that while the pupil alwai had an excel
idea of the authorit tradit govern the interpret of a
certain piec there wa noth that suggest the stilt or wooden
perform of the brainless mimic he taught hi pupil to think he
wa an indefatig student and thinker himself he had what mani
teacher would have consid peculiar idea upon technic
khler technic scheme
while he invent mani littl mean wherebi technic difficulti
could be more readili overcom than by the exist plan he could not be
call in ani wai radic he believ in carri the technic side of
a pupil educ up to a certain point along more or less
convent line when the pupil reach that point he found that he
wa upon a verit height of mechan supremaci thereaft khler
depend upon the technic difficulti present in the literatur of
the instrument to continu the technic effici acquir in other
word the acquisit of a technic wa sole to enabl the pupil to
explor the world of music equip in such a wai that he wa not to be
overcom by anyth the everlast continu of technic exercis
wa look upon by khler as a ridicul wast of time and a great
injuri
i also hold thi opinion let us suppos that i were to sit at the
piano for six or seven hour and do noth but plai convent finger
exercis what happen to my soul psycholog consid dure
those hour spent upon exercis which no man or woman could possibl
find anyth other than an irrit do not the same exercis occur
in thousand of piec but in such connect that the mind is
interest is it necessari for the advanc pianist to punish himself
with a kind of mental and physic penanc more try perhap than
the devic of the mediev ascet or the orient priest of todai
no technic is the juggernaut which ha ground to piec more musician
than on can imagin it produc a stiff wooden touch and ha a
tendenc to induc the pianist to believ that the art of pianofort
plai depend upon the continu of technic exercis wherea the
acquisit of technic abil should be regard as the begin and
not the end when pupil leav your school you sai that thei ar have
a commenc the acquisit of a technic is onli the commenc
unfortun too mani consid it the end thi mai perhap be the
reason why our conservatori turn out so mani bright and profici
young peopl who in a few year ar buri in oblivion
with liszt
when i had reach a certain grade of advanc it wa my great
fortun to becom associ with the immort franz liszt i consid
liszt the greatest man i have ever met by thi i mean that i have never
met in ani other walk of life a man with the mental grasp splendid
disposit and gloriou geniu thi mai seem a somewhat extravag
statement i have met mani mani great men ruler jurist author
scientist teacher merchant and warrior but never have i met a man
in ani posit whom i have not thought would have prove the inferior
of franz liszt had liszt chosen to follow the career of the man in
question liszt person can onli be express by on word
coloss he had the most gener natur of ani man i have ever met
he had aspir to becom a great compos greater than hi own
measur of hi work as a compos had reveal to him the dire posit
of wagner present itself he abandon hi own ambitionsambit
higher than those he ever held toward piano virtuosityabandon them
complet to champion the difficult caus of the great wagner what
liszt suffer to make thi sacrific the world doe not know but no
finer exampl of moral heroism can be imagin hi convers with
me upon the subject were so intim that i do not care to reveal on
word
liszt pedagog method
hi generos and person forc in hi work with the young artist he
assist ar hard to describ you ask me whether he had a certain
method i repli he abhor method in the modern sens of the term
hi work wa eclect in the highest sens in on wai he could not be
consid a teacher at all he charg no fee and had irregular and
somewhat unsystemat class in anoth sens he wa the greatest of
teacher sit at the piano and i will indic the gener plan pursu
by liszt at a lesson reisenau is a remark and witti mimic of

plai at some length through sever short composit eventu
come to the inevit chopin vals op 69 no 1 in a flat

listen patient return imit the walk facial express and
the peculiar guttur snort characterist of liszt in hi later year
then follow a long kindli sermon upon the emot possibl of

consid thi

chopin next thought wa no doubt

but with hi uner good tast and sens of symmetri he write it so

now consid the thing in studi it and while plai it from the

concept befor the actual transfer of the thought to paper the
thought itself is in a nebul condit the compos see it in a
thousand light befor he actual determin upon the exact form he
desir to perpetu for instanc thi theme might have gone through
chopin mind much after thi fashion
illustr
the main idea be to reach the embryo of chopin thought and by
artist insight divin the connot of that thought as nearli as
possibl in the light of the treatment chopin ha given it
it is not so much the perform duti to plai mere note and dynam
mark as it is for him to make an artist estim of the compos
intent and to feel that dure the period of reproduct he
simul the natur psycholog condit which affect the
compos dure the actual process of composit in thi wai the

reisenau attitud toward the piano is uniqu and interest
musician ar gener understood to have an affection regard for
their instrument almost patern not so with reisenau he even goe
so far as to make thi statement i have awai been drawn to the piano
by a peculiar charm i have never been abl to explain to myself i feel
that i must plai plai plai plai plai it ha becom a second natur
to me i have plai so much and so long that the piano ha becom a
part of me yet i am never free from the feel that it is a constant
battl with the instrument and even with my technic resourc i am
not abl to express all the beauti i hear in the music while music is
my veri life i nevertheless hate the piano i plai becaus i cant help
plai and becaus there is no other instrument which can come as near

the futur of pianofort music
an interest question that frequent aris in music circl
relat to the futur possibl of the art of composit in it
connect with the pianofort not a few have some consider
apprehens regard the possibl dearth of new melod materi and
the technic and artist treatment of such materi i do not think
that there need be ani fear of a lack of origin melod materi or
origin method of treat such materi the possibl of the art
of music composit have by no mean been exhaust while i feel
that in a certain sens veri difficult to illustr with word on
great school of composit for the pianofort end with liszt and
the other in brahm nevertheless i can but prophesi the aris of mani
new and wonder school in the futur i base my propheci upon the
premis of frequent similar condit dure the histori of music
art
nevertheless it is yet my ambit to give a lengthi seri of
recit with program arrang to give a chronolog aspect of all
the great masterpiec in music i hope to be enabl to do thi befor
i retir it is part of a plan to circl the world in a manner that ha
not yet been done when ask whether these program were to resembl
rubinstein famou histor recit in london year ago he
repli thei will be more extens than the rubinstein recit the
time make such a seri possibl now which rubinstein would have
hesit to give
as to american compos reisenau is so thoroughli and
enthusiast won over by macdowel that he ha not given the other
compos suffici attent to warrant a critic opinion i found
upon question that he had made a genuin sincer effort to find
new materi in america but he said that outsid of macdowel he found
noth but indiffer good salonmus with the work of sever

noth himself as a compos and declar that it wa not hi fort

i find that american music tast is in mani wai astonish mani
musician who came to america prior to the time of thoma and damrosch
return to europ with what were no doubt true stori of the music
condit in america at that time these stori were given wide
circul in europ and it is difficult for european to understand
the cultur condit of the american peopl at the present time
america can never thank dr leopold damrosch and theodor thoma enough
for their unceas labor thank to the impetu that thei gave the
movement it is now possibl to plai program in almost ani american
citi that ar in no sens differ from those on is expect to give
in great european capit the statu of music educ in the

element necessarili affect it to a certain extent but in mani case
thi is not as injuri as might be imagin the futur of music in
america seem veri roseat to me and i can look back to my american
concert tour with great pleasur
concert condit in america
on of the great difficulti howev in concert tour in america
is the matter of enorm distanc i often think that american
audienc rare hear great pianist at their best consid the
larg amount of monei involv in a success american tour and the
busi enterpris which must be extrem forc to make such a tour
possibl it is not to be wonder that enorm journei must be made
in ridicul short time no on can imagin what thi mean to even a

i have been oblig to plai in on western citi on night and in an
eastern citi the follow night hundr of mile lai between them in
the latter citi i wa oblig to go directli from the railroad depot to
the stage of the concert hall hungri tire travel worn and without

conditionsyet certain condit make these thing unavoid in

on of the most inestim advantag i have ever had wa my good
fortun in have a music mother it is to her that i ow my whole
career as an artist if it had not been for her love care and her
patient persist i might have been engag in some entir differ
pursuit as a child i wa veri indiffer to music i abhor
practic and in fact show no sign of pronounc talent until my
twelfth year but she kept faithfulli peg awai at me and insist
that becaus my grandfath had been a note artist and becaus she wa
devot to music it must be in my blood
my mother wa a pupil of depp of whom miss ami fai ha written in her
book music studi in germani depp wa a remark pedagogu and had
excel idea upon the foundat of a ration system of touch he
sought the most natur posit of the hand and alwai aim to work
along the line of least resist my mother instil depp idea
into me togeth with a veri comprehens train in the standard
etud and classic within my youth technic grasp for those year
i could not have had a better teacher lucki is the child who like
gounod reisenau and other ha had the invalu instruct that
a patient selfsacrif mother can give the mother is the most
unselfish of all teacher and is painstak to a fault
slow systemat practic
she insist upon slow systemat regular practic she knew the
import of regular and on of the first thing i ever learn wa
that if i miss on or two dai practic i could not hope to make it
up by practic overtim on the follow dai practic dai miss or
skip ar gone forev on must make a fresh start and the loss is
sometim not recov for sever dai
i wa also made to realiz the necess of fresh at the practic
period the pupil who want to make hi practic lead to result must
feel well while practic practic while tire either mental or
physic is wast practic
pupil must learn to concentr and if thei have not the abil to do
thi natur thei should have a master who will teach them how it is
not easi to fix the mind upon on thing and at the same time drive everi
other thought awai with some young pupil thi take much practic
some never acquir itit is not in them concentr is the vertebr
of music success the student who cannot concentr had better
abandon music studi in fact the young person who cannot concentr
is not like to be a conspicu success in ani line of activ the
studi of music cultiv the pupil power of concentr perhap
more than ani other studi the note to be plai must be recogn
instantan and correctli perform in music the mind ha no time
to wander thi is on of the reason why music is so valuabl even for
those who do not ever contempl a profession career
on hour of concentr practic with the mind fresh and the bodi
rest is better than four hour of dissip practic with the mind
stale and the bodi tire with a fatigu intellect the finger simpli
dawdl over the kei and noth is accomplish i find in my own daili
practic that it is best for me to practic two hour in the morn and
then two hour later in the dai when i am finish with two hour of
hard studi i am exhaust from close concentr i have also note
that ani time over thi period is wast i am too fatigu for the
practic to be of ani benefit to me
the necess for a good gener educ
parent make a great mistak in not insur the gener educ of
the child who is destin to becom a concert perform i can imagin
noth more stultifi or more like to result in artist disast
than the cours that some parent take in neglect the child school
work with an idea that if he is to becom a profession musician he
need onli devot himself to music thi onesid cultiv should be
reserv for idiot who can do noth els the childwond is often
the victim of some mental disturb
i rememb onc see a remark child mathematician in hungari he
wa onli twelv year of ag and yet the most complic mathemat
problem were solv in a few second without recours to paper the
child had water on the brain and live but a few year hi us
to the world of mathemat wa limit sole to show purpos it is
precis the same with the socal music precoc thei ar
rare success in after life and unless train by some veri wise
and care teacher thei soon becom object for piti
the child who is design to becom a concert pianist should have the
broadest possibl cultur he must live in the world of art and letter
and becom a natur citizen the wider the rang of hi
inform experi and sympathi the larger will be the audienc
he will reach when he come to talk to them from the concert platform
it is the same as with a public speaker no on want to hear a speaker
who ha led a narrow crab intellectu exist but the man who
ha seen and known the world who ha becom acquaint with the great
masterpiec of art and the wonder achiev of scienc ha
littl difficulti in secur an audienc provid he ha master the
mean of express hi idea
clean plai vs slovenli plai
in the matter of technic prepar there is perhap too littl
attent be given todai to the necess for clean plai of
cours each individu requir a differ treatment the pupil who
ha a tendenc to plai with stiff and rigid mai be given studi
which will develop a more fluent style for these pupil studi like
those of heller ar desir in the case of student with onli
moder technic abil while the splendid etud of chopin ar
excel remedi for advanc pupil with tendenc toward hard
rigid plai the difficulti on ordinarili meet howev is rag
slovenli plai rather than stiff rigid plai to remedi thi
slovenli there is noth like the wellknown work of czerni
cramer or clementi
i have frequent told pupil in my meisterschul in vienna befor i
abandon teach for my work as a concert pianist that thei must
learn to draw befor thei learn to paint thei will persist in try to
appli color befor thei learn the art of make correct design thi
lead to dismal failur in almost everi case technic firstthen
interpret the great concertgo public ha no us for a player
with a dirti slovenli technic no matter how much he strive to make
morbidli sentiment interpret that ar expect to reach the
lover of sensat for such player a conscienti and exact studi
of czerni cramer clementi and other of similar design is good
music soap and water it wash them into respect and technic
decenc the pianist with a bungl slovenli technic who at the same
time attempt to perform the great masterpiec remind me of those
person who attempt to disguis the necess for soap and water with
nauseat perfum
health a vital factor
few peopl realiz what a vital factor health is to the concert pianist
the student should never fail to think of thi mani young american who
go abroad to studi break down upon the veri vehicl upon which thei must
depend in their ride to success through the indiscret of overwork or
wrong live the concert pianist realli live a life of privat i
alwai make it a point to restrict myself to certain hygien rule on
the dai befor a concert i have a certain diet and a certain amount of
exercis and sleep without which i cannot plai successfulli
in america on is overcom with the kind of wellmean peopl who
insist upon late supper recept etc it is hard to refus kind
of thi descript but i have alwai felt that my debt to my audienc
wa a matter of prime import and while on tour i refrain from
social pleasur of all kind my mind and my bodi must be right or
failur will sure result
i have often had peopl sai to me after the perform of some
particularli brilliant number ah you must have taken a bottl of
champagn to give a perform like that noth could be further
from the truth a half a bottl of beer would ruin a recit for me the
habit of take alcohol drink with the idea that thei lead to a more
fieri perform is a danger custom that ha been the ruin of more
than on pianist the perform who would be at hi best must live a
veri care almost abstemi life ani unnatur excess is sure to
mar hi plai and lead to hi downfal with the public i have seen
thi done over and over again and have watch alcohol tear down in a
few year what had taken decad of hard practic and earnest studi to
build up
judici us of technic exercis
the field of music is so enorm that i have often thought that the
teacher should be veri care not to overdo the matter of give
technic exercis technic exercis ar at best short cut thei
ar necessari for the student he should have a varieti of them and not
be kept incessantli pound awai at on or two exercis as nichola
rubinstein onc said to me scale should never be dry if you ar not
interest in them work with them until you becom interest in them
thei should be plai with accent and in differ rhythm if thei ar
given in the shapeless manner in which some teacher oblig their
unfortun pupil to practic them thei ar worthless i do not
believ in work out technic exercis at a tabl or with a dumb
piano the brain must alwai work with the finger and without the
sound of the piano the imagin must be enorm stretch to get
anyth more than the most senseless toneless soulless touch
technic with mani is unmistak a gift i sai thi after have given
the matter much care thought it is like the gift of speech some
peopl ar fluent talker precis as some peopl can do more in two
hour technic work at the keyboard than other could accomplish with
four of cours much can be accomplish with persist practic and
a latent gift mai be awaken but it is certainli not given to all to
becom abl technicalist again some becom veri profici from the
technic standpoint but ar barren soulless uninspir and vapid
when it come to the artist and musicianli interpret of a piec
there come a time to everi advanc pianist when such exercis as the
scale arpeggio the studi of czerni and cramer ar unnecessari i
have not practic them for some year but prai do not think that i
attempt to go without exercis these exercis i make by select
difficult part of famou piec and practic them over and over i
find the concerto of hummel particularli valuabl in thi connect
and there ar part of some of the beethoven concerto that make
splendid music exercis that i can practic without the fatal
diminut of interest which make a technic exercis valueless
studi abroad
in the matter of foreign studi i think that i mai speak without bia as
i am engag in teach and am not like to resum for some year i
am absolut convinc that there ar mani teacher in america who
ar as good as the best in europ nevertheless i would advis the
young american to secur the best instruct possibl in hi nativ
land and then to go abroad for a further cours it will serv to
broaden him in mani wai
i believ in patriot and i admir the man who stick to hi
fatherland but in art there is no such thing as patriot as the
conservatori of pari provid through the prix de rome for a three
year resid in itali and other countri for the most promis
pupil so the young american music student should avail themselv of
the advantag of old world civil art and music there is much
to be learn from the hustl and vigor wholesom growth of your own
countri that would be of decid advantag to the german student who
could afford a term of resid here it is narrow to think that on
should avoid the old world art center from the standpoint of american
patriot
versatil
few peopl recogn the multifari requir of the concert
pianist he must adjust himself to all sort of hall piano and live
condit the differ between on piano and anoth is often veri
remark it sometim oblig the artist to readjust hi technic
method veri materi again the differ in hall is noteworthi
in a great hall like the albert hall of london on can onli strive for
veri broad effect it is not possibl for on to attempt the delic
shade which the smaller hall demand much is lost in the great hall
and it is often unjust to determin the pianist abil by hi
exclus bravura perform in veri larg auditorium
cultiv finger strength
the concert pianist must have great endur hi finger must be as
strong as steel and yet thei must be as elast and as suppl as willow
wand i have alwai had great faith in the klein pischna and the
pischna exercis in cultiv strength these exercis ar now
world famou and it would be hard for me to imagin anyth better for
thi particular purpos thei ar somewhat volumin but necessarili
so on conspicu difficulti with which teacher have to contend is
that pupil attempt piec requir great digit strength without ever
have gone through such a cours as i advoc abov the result is
that thei have all sort of troubl with their hand through strain
some of these troubl ar irremedi other ar curabl but caus
annoi delai i have never had anyth of thi sort and attribut my
immun from weep sinew etc to correct hand posit a loos
wrist and slow systemat work in my youth
veloc
veloc depend more upon natur elast than strength some peopl
seem to be born with the abil to plai rapidli it is alwai a matter
of the finger but is more a matter of the brain some peopl have the
abil to think veri rapidli and when these peopl have good suppl
hand thei seem to be abl to plai rapidli with compar littl
studi when you fail to get veloc at first do not hesit to lai
the piec asid for sever week month or year then you will
doubtless find that the matter of veloc will not troubl you too
much studi upon a piec that fail for the time be to respond to
earnest effort is often a bad thing be a littl patient it will all
come out right in the end if you fuss and fume for immedi result
you mai be sadli disappoint
talent
talent is great and immut take the case of liszt for instanc i
recent heard from a reliabl sourc the follow interest stori
on dai liszt wa call awai from hi class at wiemar by an invit
to visit the grand duke von blow then a matur artist wa present
and he wa ask by liszt to teach the class for the dai liszt left the
room and a young student wa ask to plai on of liszt own
composit von blow did not like the youth interpret as he
had been accustom to plai the same work on tour in a veri differ
manner consequ he abus the student roundli and then sat at the
keyboard and wa plai to hi great satisfact when the totter
old master broke in the room and with equal sever reprimand von
blow and sat down at the keyboard and gave an interpret that wa
infinit superior to that of von blow it wa simpli a case of
superior of talent that enabl the ag and somewhat infirm liszt to
excel hi younger contemporari
be natur
in close let me enjoin all young american music student to strive
for natur avoid ostentati movement in your plai let your
plai be as quiet as possibl the wrist should be loos the hand
to my mind should be neither high nor low but should be in line with
the forearm on should continu strive for quiet noth should
be forc eas in plai is alwai admir and come in time to all
talent student who seek it the depp method of hand posit while
pedant and unnecessarili long is interest and instruct
person i advoc the us of the etud of chopin moschel and
the etud transcendant to all advanc pupil i have us them with
pupil with invari success i have also a seri of thirteen etud
of my own that i have made for the express purpos of afford pupil
materi for work which is not adequ cover in the usual cours
young american have a great futur befor them the pupil i have had
have invari been on who progress with astonish rapid thei
show keen and good tast and ar will to work faithfulli and
conscienti and that after all is the true road to success
talent count
if you think that talent doe not count you ar veri greatli mistaken
we not infrequ see men who have been engag in on occup with
onli veri moder success suddenli leap into fame in an entir
differ line men who have struggl to be great artist or
illustr like du maurier astonish the world with a previous
conceal literari abil it is foolish not to recogn the part that
talent must plai in the career of artist sometim hard work and
patient persist will stimul the mind and soul and reveal talent
that were never suppos to exist but if the talent doe not exist it
is as hopeless to hunt for it as it is to seek for diamond in a bowl of
porridg
talent peopl seem to be born with the knack or abil to do certain
thing twice as well and twice as quickli as other peopl can do the
same thing i well rememb that when all europ wa wild over the
diabolo craze my littl girl commenc to plai with the stick and the
littl spool it look interest and i thought that i would try it a
few time and then show her how to do it the more i tri the more

it i had wast a whole morn upon it my littl daughter took it up
and in a few minut practic she wa abl to do it as well as an

hour to accomplish other can do in a few second with appar less

economi in music studi
xaver scharwenka
it is somewhat of a question whether ani time spent in music studi is
actual wast sinc all intellectu activ is necessarili
accompani by an intellectu advanc howev it soon becom
appar to the young teacher that result can be achiev with a great
economi of time if the right method ar us by the us of the word
right method i do not mean to infer that onli on right method
exist the right method for on pupil might be quit differ from
that which would bring about the best result with anoth pupil in
these dai far more elast of method exist than wa gener
sanction in the past and the great of the teacher consist veri
larg of hi abil to invent adapt and adjust hi pedagog
mean to the special requir of hi pupil thu it happen that the
teacher by select onli those exercis etud and teach piec
demand by the obviou need of the pupil and by elimin
unnecessari materi a much more rapid rate of advanc mai be
obtain on pupil for instanc might lack those qualiti of
veloc and dexter which mani of the etud of czerni develop in
such an admir manner while anoth pupil might be defici in the
sing tone which is almost invari improv by the studi of
certain chopin etud
time lost in earli studi
although my educ work for mani year ha been almost exclus
limit to pupil prepar for career as teacher and as concert
pianist i nevertheless have natur taken a great interest in those
broad and signific problem which underli the elementari train of
the young music student i have written quit extens upon the
subject and my idea have been quit definit express in my book
methodik de klavierspiel systematisch darstellung der technischen
und sthetischen erforderniss fr einen rationellen lehrgang i have
also come in close contact with thi branch of music work in the
klindworthscharwenka conservatori in berlin
my observ have led to the firm convict that much of the time
lost in music studi could be save if the elementari train of the
pupil were made more comprehens and more secur it is by no mean an
economi of time to hurri over the foundat work of the pupil it is
also by no mean an economi of monei to place the beginn in the hand
of a secondr teacher there is just as much need for the specialist
to train the pupil at the start as there is for the head of the
meisterschul to guid the bud virtuoso how can we expect the
pupil to make rapid progress if the start is not right on might as
well expect a brokendown automobil to win a race the equip at the
begin must be of the kind which will carri the pupil through hi
entir career with success if ani omiss occur thei must be made up
later on and the difficulti in repair thi neglect is twice as great
as it would have been had the student receiv the proper instruct at
the start
eartrain
the train of the ear is of great import and if teacher would
onli make sure that their pupil studi music with their sens of
hear as well as with their finger much time would be save in later
work young pupil should be taught to listen by permit them to hear
good music which is at the same time suffici simpl to insur
comprehens earli music educ is altogeth too onesid the
child is taken to the piano and a peculiar set of hieroglyph known as
notat is displai to him he is given a few week to comprehend that
these sign refer to certain kei on the keyboard he commenc to push
down these kei faithfulli and patient and hi music educ is
thu launch in what mani consid the approv manner noth is said
about the mean of the piec it rhythm it harmoni it sthetic
beauti noth is told of the compos or of the period in which the
piec wa written it would be just about as sensibl to teach a pupil
to repeat the sound of the chines languag by read the chines
wordsign but without comprehend the mean of the sound and
sign is it ani wonder that beginn lose interest in their work and
refus to practis except when compel to do so
i am most emphat in favor of a more ration a more broad and a
more thorough train of the beginn time taken from that ordinarili
given to the senseless brainless work up and down of the finger at
the keyboard and devot to those studi such as harmoni music
histori form and in fact ani studi which will tend to widen the
pupil knowledg and increas hi interest will save much time in
later work
wast in technic studi
geometr speak the shortest distanc between two point is a
straight line teacher should make everi possibl effort to find the
straight line of technic which will carri the pupil from hi first step
to technic profici without wander about through endless lane
and avenu which lead to no particular end i suppos that all american
teacher hear the same complaint that is heard by all european teacher
when ani attempt is made to insist upon thorough practic and adequ
studi from the dilettant as soon as the teacher demand certain
indispens technic studi certain necessari investig of the
harmon sthetic or histor problem which contribut so much to
the excel of pianist interpret he hear the follow
complaint i dont want to be a compos or i dont want to be a
virtuosoi onli want to plai just a littl for my own amus the
teacher know and appreci the pupil attitud exactli and while he
realiz that hi reason is altogeth fatuou it seem wellnigh
imposs to explain to the amateur that unless he doe hi work right
he will get veri littl real pleasur or amus out of it
the whole sum and substanc of the matter is that a certain amount of
technic theoret and histor knowledg must be acquir to make
the musician befor we can make a player there is the distinct
teacher should never fail to rememb that their first consider
should be to make a musician all unmus plai is insuffer no
amount of technic studi will make a musician and all technic studi
which simpli aim to make the finger go faster or plai complic
rhythm is wast unless there is the foundat and cultur of the
real musician behind it
to the sincer student everi piec present technic problem peculiar
to itself the main object to all technic studi is that unless the
pupil is vital interest the work becom monoton the student
should constantli strive to avoid monotoni in practic exercis as
soon as the exercis becom dull and uninterest their valu
immedi depreci the onli wai to avoid thi is to seek varieti
as i have said in my methodik de klavierspiel the music and
tonal monotoni of technic exercis mai be lessen in a measur by
progress modul by variou rhythmic alter and further
through frequent chang in contrari motion great stress should be
laid upon practic in contrari motion the reason for thi is obviou to
all student of harmoni when plai in contrari motion all uneven
all break in precis and all unbalanc condit of touch becom
much more evid to the ear than if the same exercis were plai in
parallel motion anoth import reason for the help of plai
in contrari motion is not to be undervalu it is that a kind of
physic sympathi is develop between the finger and the nerv
which oper them in the correspond hand for instanc it is much
easier to plai with the fifth finger of on hand and the fifth finger of
the other hand than it is to plai with the third finger of on hand and
the fifth finger of anoth
wast in unimport subject
there is a gener impress among teacher todai that much time might
be save by a more care select of studi and by a better
adapt of the studi to particular pupil for instanc carl
czerni wrote over on thousand opu number he wrote some of the most
valuabl studi ever written but no on would think of demand a
pupil to plai all of the czerni studi ani more than the student
should be compel to plai everyth that loeschhorn cramer and
clementi ever wrote studi must be select with great care and
adapt to particular case and if the young teacher feel himself
incap of do thi he should either us select or collect
of studi edit by abl author or he should place himself under
the advic of some matur and experienc teacher until the right
experi ha been obtain it would not be a bad plan to demand that
all young teacher be apprent to an older teacher until the right
amount of experi ha been obtain the complet of a cours in
music doe not impli that the student is abl to teach teach and the
matter of music profici ar two veri differ thing mani
conservatori now conduct class for teacher which ar excel in
their wai in the olden dai a mechan had to work side by side with
hi master befor he wa consid profici to do hi work by
himself how much more import is it that our educ should be
compet train thei do not have to deal with machineri but thei
do have to deal with the most wonder of all machinesth human
brain
some studi in us by teacher ar undeserv of their popular
accord to my wai of think some studi ar altogeth trivial and
quit dispens i have never held ani particular fond for heller
for instanc hi studi ar tune but thei seem to me in mani
case weak imit of the style of some master such as schumann
mendelssohn etc who mai be studi with more profit i believ that
the studi of loeschhorn possess great pedagog valu loeschhorn
wa a born teacher he knew how to collect and present technic
difficulti in a manner design to be of real assist to the
student the studi of kullak ar also extrem fine
thi is a subject which is far more signific than it mai at first
appear whatev the student mai choos to studi after he leav the
teacher hi work while under the teacher direct should be focus
upon just those piec which will be of most valu to him the teacher
should see that the cours he prescrib is unifi there should be no
wast materi some teacher ar inclin to teach piec of a
worthless order to gain the fickl interest of some pupil thei feel
that it is better to teach an operat arrang no matter how
superfici and retain the interest of the pupil than to insist upon
what thei know is realli best for the pupil and run the risk of have
the pupil go to anoth teacher less conscienti about make
compromis of thi sort when the teacher ha come to a posit where
he is oblig to permit the pupil to select hi own piec or dictat
the kind of piec he is to be taught in order to retain hi interest
the teacher will find that he ha veri littl influenc over the pupil
pupil who insist upon map out their own career ar alwai
stumblingblock it is far better to make it veri clear to the pupil
in the first place that interfer of thi kind is never desir
and that unless the pupil ha implicit confid in the teacher
judgment it is better to discontinu
brain technic versu finger technic
few pupil realiz that hour and hour ar wast at the piano keyboard
do those thing which we ar alreadi abl to do and in the quest of
someth which we alreadi possess when we come to think of it everi
on is born with a kind of finger dexter ani on can move the
finger up and down with great rapid no studi of the pianofort
keyboard is necessari to do thi the savag in the african wild is
gift with that kind of dexter although he mai never have seen a
pianofort then why spend hour in practic at the keyboard with the
view of do someth we can alreadi do it mai come as a surpris to
mani when i make the statement that thei alreadi possess a kind of
dexter and veloc which thei mai not suspect on doe not have to
work for year to make the finger go up and down quickli it is also a
fact that a few lesson under a realli good teacher and a few ticket
for highclass piano recit will often give the feel and knack of
produc a good touch for which mani strive in vain for year at the
keyboard
no the technic which take time is the technic of the brain which
direct the finger to the right place at the right time thi mai be
made the greatest sourc of music economi if you want to save time in
your music studi see that you comprehend your music problem
thoroughli you must see it right in your mind you must hear it right
you must feel it right befor you place your finger on the keyboard
you should have form your ideal mental concept of the proper
rhythm the proper tonal qualiti the sthetic valu and the harmon
content these thing can onli be perfectli comprehend after studi
thei do not come from strum at the keyboard thi after all is the
greatest possibl mean for save time in music studi
a great deal might be said upon the subject of the teacher part in
save time the good teacher is a keen critic hi experi and hi
innat abil enabl him to diagnos fault just as a train medic
specialist can determin the caus of a diseas with accuraci and
rapid much depend upon the diagnosi it is no save to go to a
doctor who diagnos your case as on of rheumat and treat you for
rheumat pain wherea you ar realli suffer from neurasthenia in
a similar manner an unskil and incompet teacher mai wast much
treasur time in treat you for technic and music defici
entir differ from those which you realli suffer great care should
be taken in select a teacher for with the wrong teacher not onli time
is wast but talent energi and sometim that jewel in the crown of
successambit
a case in point
an illustr of on mean of wast time is well indic in the
case of some pedagog who hold to old idea in pianoplai simpli
becaus thei ar old i believ in conservat but at the same time i
am oppos to conservat which exclud all progress the world
is continu advanc and we ar continu find out new thing
as well as determin which of the older method will prove the best in
the long run all music europ ha been upset dure the last quarter
of the centuri over the vital subject of whether the pressur touch is
better than the angular blow touch there wa a time in the past when an
appar effort wa made to make everyth pertain to pianofort
technic as stiff and inelast as possibl the finger were train to
hop up and down like littl hammersth arm wa held stiff and hard at
the side in fact it wa not uncommon for some teacher to put a book
under the armpit and insist upon their pupil hold it there by
press against the bodi dure the practic period
h ehrlich who in hi dai wa a wide recogn author wrote a
pamphlet to accompani hi edit of the tausig technic studi in
which thi system is veri clearli outlin he assert that tausig
insist upon it todai we wit a great revolut the arm ar
held freeli and rigid of all kind is avoid it wa found that the
entir system of touch wa under a more delic and sensit control
when the pressur touch wa emploi than when the mechan hit
touch wa us it wa also found that much of the time spent in
develop the hit touch along mechan line wa wast sinc
superior result could be achiev in a shorter time by mean of
press and knead the kei rather than deliv blow to them
the pressur touch seem to me veri much freer and i am emphat in
favor of it the older method produc cramp unmus plai and the
pupil wa so restrict that he remind on for all the world of the
newfangl skirt hobbleskirt which seem to give our ladi of
fashion so much difficulti just now
the american pupil who have come to germani to studi with me have been
for the most part exceedingli well train in america there ar
innumer excel teacher the american pupil is almost alwai veri
industri hi chief point of vantag is hi abil to concentr
he doe not dissip hi time or thought in some instanc he can onli
remain in europ for two yearssometim less he quit natur feel
that a great deal must be done in those two year and consequ he
work at white heat thi is not a disadvantag for hi mental power
ar intensifi and he is faith to hi labor
the young women of america ar for the most part veri selfreli thi
is also veri much to their advantag as a rule thei know how to take
care of themselv and yet thei have the courag to ventur and ask
question when question should be ask my resid in america ha
brought me mani good friend and it is a pleasur to note the great
advanc made in everi wai sinc my last visit here i am particularli
anxiou to have some of my later composit becom better known in
america as i have great faith in the music futur of the countri i
wish that thei might becom familiar with such work as my fourth

learn a new piec
ernest schell
preliminari studi
in studi a new music composit experi ha reveal to me that
the student can save much time and get a better gener idea of the
composit by read it over sever time befor go to the
instrument while thi is difficult for veri young pupil to do befor
thei have becom accustom to mental interpret the note into
sound without the assist of the instrument it is nevertheless of
advantag from the veri start it save the pupil from much unprofit
blunder to take a piec right to the keyboard without ani
preliminari consider mai perhap be good practic for those who
would cultiv readi sight read but it should be rememb that
even the most apt sight reader will usual take the precaut of
look a new piec through at least onc to place themselv on guard
for the more difficult or more complic passag by form the
habit of read awai from the piano the pupil soon becom abl to hear
the music without make the sound at the keyboard and thi lead to a
mental concept of the piec as a whole which invari produc
surprisingli good result
the technic demand of the piec
the next consider should be the execut of the right note a
careless primavista read often lead the pupil to plai note quit
differ from those actual in the piec it is astonish how often
some pupil ar deceiv in thi matter until you have insur absolut
accuraci in the matter of the note you ar not in condit to regard
the other detail the failur to repeat an accident chromat
alter in the same bar the neglect of a tie or an enharmon
interv with a tie ar all common fault which mark careless
perform after the piec ha been read as a whole and you have
determin upon the note so that there is no opportun for inaccuraci
from that sourc you will find that the best wai to proce is to take a
veri small passag and studi that passag first for the inexperienc
student i should suggest two measur or a phrase of similar length do
not leav these two measur until you ar convinc that you have
master them thi will take a great amount of concentr mani
pupil fail becaus thei underestim the amount of concentr
requir thei expect result to come without effort and ar invari
disappoint after the first two measur have been master take the
next two measur and learn these thoroughli then go back and learn
measur two and three so that there mai be no possibl of a break or
interrupt between them next proce in the same wai with the
follow four measur and do not stop until you have complet the
piec
thi kind of studi mai take more time than the method to which you have
becom accustom but it is by all mean the most thorough and the most
satisfactori i found it indispens in the prepar of piec for
public perform it demand the closest kind of studi and thi
lead to artist result and a higher percept of the music valu
of the composit be studi take for instanc the c major fantasi
of schumann on of the most beauti and yet on of the most difficult
of all composit to interpret properli at first the whole work seem
disunit and if studi carelessli the necessari uniti which should
mark thi work can never be secur but if studi with minut regard
for detail after the manner in which i have suggest the whole
composit becom wonderfulli compact and everi part is link to the
other part so that a beauti uniti must result
formal divis
mani work have formal divis such as those of the sonata the
suit etc even the liszt rhapsodi have movement of mark
differ in tempo and style here the secret is to studi each
divis in it relat to the whole there must be an intern harmoni
between all the part otherwis the interpret will mar the great
masterpiec the difficulti is to find the bear of on movement upon
anoth even the theme of subject of the convent sonata have a
definit interrel how to interpret these theme and yet at the
same time produc contrast and uniti is difficult it is thi differ
of interpret that add charm to the piano recit of differ
virtuoso there is no on right wai and no on best wai but rather an
indefinit margin for person opinion and the exhibit of artist
tast if there wa on best wai there ar now machin which could
record that wai and there the whole matter would end but we want to
hear all the wai and consequ we go to the recit of differ
pianist how can i express more emphat the necess for the
pianist be a man of cultur artist sensibl and of creativ
tendenc the student must be taught to think about hi
interpret and if thi point is miss and he is permit to give
convent uninspir perform he need never hope to plai
artist
the touch requir
in studi a new piec as soon as the style of the piec ha been
determin and the accuraci of the note secur the pupil should
consid the allimport matter to touch he should have been
previous instruct in the principl of the differ kind of touch
us in pianofort plai i am a firm believ in associ the
appropri kind of touch with the passag studi from the veri
begin if the passag call for a staccato touch do not wast your
time as mani do by practic it legato again in a cantabil passag
do not make the mistak of us a touch that would produc the wrong
qualiti of tone the wrist at all time should be in the most suppl
possibl condit there should never be ani constraint at that point
when i resum my music studi with paderewski after a laps of
sever year he laid greatest emphasi upon thi point i feel that the
most valuabl year for the develop of touch and tone ar those
which bind the natur facil of the child hand with the acquir
agil of the adult to my great misfortun i wa not abl to practic
between the ag of twelv and eighteen thi wa due to excess studi
and extens concert tour as a prodigi these wreck my health and it
wa onli by the hardest kind of practic in after life that i wa abl
to regain the natur facil that had mark my plai in childhood
in fact i ow everyth to the kind persist and wonder
inspir of m paderewski
the right tempo
the right tempo is a veri import matter for the student first of
all he must be absolut posit that hi time is correct there is
noth so barbar in all pianoplai as a bad concept of time
even the inexperienc and unmus listen detect bad time the
student should consid thi matter on of greatest import and
demand perfect time from himself with some student thi can onli be
cultiv after much pain effort the metronom is of assist as
is count but these ar not enough the pupil must creat a sens of
time he must have a sort of intern metronom which he must feel
throb within all the time
alwai begin your practic slowli and gradual advanc the tempo the
worst possibl thing is to start practic too fast it invari
lead to bad result and to lengthi delai the right tempo will come
with time and you must have patienc until you can develop it in the
matter of tempo rubato passag which alwai invit disast upon the
part of the student the gener idea is that the right hand must be out
of time with the left thi is not alwai the case as thei sometim
plai in unison the word simpli impli rob the time but it is
rob after the same manner in which on rob peter to pai paul that
is a ritard in on part of the measur must be compens for by an
acceler in anoth part of the measur if the right hand is to
plai at varianc with the left hand the latter remain as a kind of
anchor upon which the tempo of the entir measur must depend chopin
call the left hand the chef dorchestr and a veri good appel
thi is take for instanc hi b flat minor prelud in the latter
part of thi wonder composit the regular rhythmic repetit in
octav in the bass make a rhythmic foundat which the most errat
and nervou right hand cannot shake
rhythmic peculiar
rhythm is the basi of everyth even the silent mountain boulder
ar but the monument of some terribl rhythmic convuls of the earth
in past ag there is a rhythm in the hum bird and there is a
rhythm in the movement of a giant locomot we ar all rhythmic in
our speech our walk and in our life more or less how import then
is the studi of the rhythmic peculiar of the new piec everi
contribut accent which give motion and characterist swing to the
piec must be carefulli studi it is rhythm which swai the audienc
some perform ar so gift with the abil to invest their
interpret with a rhythmic charm that thei seem to fairli
invigor their audienc with the spirit of motion i cannot conceiv
of a realli great artist without thi sens of rhythm
the compos inspir
person i believ in pure music that is music in the field of
pianofort composit that is suffici unto itself and which doe not
requir ani of the other art to enhanc it beauti howev in the
case of some of our modern compos who have professedli drawn their
music inspir from tale great pictur or from natur i can see
the desir of investig these sourc in order to come closer
to the compos idea some of the work of debussi demand thi let me
plai you hi night in granada for instanc the work is most subtl
and requir an appreci of orient life and is inde a kind of
tonal dream pictur of the old fortifi palac of moorish spain i feel
that in case of thi kind it help the perform to have in mind the
compos concept and in plai thi piec in public i alwai
follow thi plan
studi the phrase
each phrase in a piec requir separ studi i believ that the
student should leav noth undon to learn how to phrase or rather to
analyz a piec so that all it constitu phrase becom clear to him
each phrase must be studi with the same defer to detail that the
singer would give to an individu phrase thi is by no mean an easi
matter more import still is the interrel of phrase everi note
in a work of music art bear a certain relat to everi other note
so it is with the phrase each phrase must be plai with refer to
the work as a whole or more particularli to the movement of which it is
a part
mark the finger
it seem hardli necessari to sai anyth about the finger when so
much attent is be given to the matter by the best teacher of the
countri but certainli on of the most essenti consider in the
studi of a new piec is the studi of the finger a detail studi of
thi should be made and it should be clearli understood that the
finger should be adapt to fit the hand of the player it is by no
mean necessari to accept the finger given in the book as gospel
the wise student will try mani finger befor decid upon the on
that suit him best student who go to these pain ar the on who
invari succe those who take anyth that is present to them
without consid it advis rare attain lofti music
height
when a finger ha onc been determin upon it should never be
chang to chang a finger frequent mean to wast mani hour of
practic thi mai be consid a mechan method but it is the
method invari emploi by success artist why simpli becaus
on finger close adher to establish finger habit which give
freedom and certainti and permit the player to give more consider
to the other detail of artist interpret
i ofttim find it expedi to adapt a more difficult finger of
some given passag for the reason that the difficult finger
frequent lead to a better interpret of the compos mean i
know of innumer passag in the piano classic which illustr thi
point moreov a finger that seem difficult at first is often more
simpl than the convent or arbitrari finger emploi by the
student after the student ha given suffici time to the new
finger the requir accent often oblig the perform to emploi a
differ finger the stronger finger ar natur better adapt
to the stronger accent otherwis it is best to us a similar finger
for similar passag
memor
i should like to add a few word with regard to commit piec to
memori there ar three wai 1 by sight that is see the note in
your mind ey 2 memor by ear the wai which come to on most
natur 3 memor by the finger that is train the finger to
do their duti no matter what happen befor perform in public the
student should have memor the composit in all of these wai onli
thu can he be absolut sure of himself if on wai fail him the
other method come to hi rescu
after care attent ha been given to the variou point of which i
have spoken and the detail of the composit satisfactorili work out
the student should practic with a view to learn the piec as a
whole noth is so distress to the musician as a piec which doe
not seem to have coher and uniti it should be regard aural as
the artist regard hi work visual the painter stand off at some
distanc to look at hi work in order to see whether all part of hi
paint harmon the pianist must do much the same thing he must
listen to hi work time and time again and if it doe not seem to hang
togeth he must unifi all the part until he can give a real
interpret instead of a collect of disjoint section thi
demand grasp insight and talent three qualif without which
the pianist cannot hope for larg success

sigismund stojowski wa born at strelc poland mai 2 1870 he studi
piano with l zelenski at cracow and with dimer at the pari
conservatoir at the same institut he studi composit with lo
delib hi talent both as a compos and as a pianist wa consid
extraordinari at that time and he wa success in carri off two
first prize on for piano and on for composit 1889 at that time
stojowski great fellow countryman paderewski assum the educ
supervis of hi career and becam hi teacher in person
stojowski orchestr composit attract wide attent in pari
and he met with pronounc success as a virtuoso mr stojowski came to
america in 1906 and he enter immedi into the music life of the
countri take foremost rank as a compos pianist and teacher asid
from hi music talent he is a remark linguist and speak mani
languag fluentli hi articl written in english for instanc ar
unusu graphic and express onc when compliment upon hi
linguist abil he remark we pole ar given the credit of be
natur linguist becaus we take the troubl to learn mani languag
thoroughli in our youth in 1913 mr stojowski made a highli success

what interpret realli is
sigismund stojowski
the compos limit in hi mean of express
it is difficult for some peopl who ar not vers in the intric
mysteri of the art of music to realiz how limit ar the mean
afford the compos for commun to the interpret some slight
indic of the ideal he had in mind when write the composit it
mai be said that while everi great compos feel almost godlik at
the moment of creation the merest fraction of the myriad beauti he
ha in mind ever reach human ear the veri sign with which the
compos is provid to help him put hi thought down on paper ar in
themselv inadequ to serv as a mean of record more than a
shadow of hi masterpiec as it wa origin conceiv of cours we
ar speak now in a larg sensew ar imagin that the compos is
a beethoven with an immort messag to convei to poster of all
compos beethoven wa perhap the on to emploi the most perfect
mean of express hi work repres a complet a pois and a
masterli finish which will serv as a model for all time to come it
must also be note that few compos have emploi more accur mark
of expressionsuch as time mark dynam mark etc
in all these thing beethoven wa oblig to adher to the convent
adopt by other for thi purpos of attempt to make the compos
mean clearer to other mind these convent like all convent
ar partli insuffici to convei the full idea of the compos and
partli arbitrari in that thei do not give the interpret adequ
latitud to introduc hi own idea in express the student should
seek to break the veil of convent provid by notat and seek a
clearer insight into the compos individu as express in hi
composit from thi point of view the socal subject
interpret seem the onli legitim on in fact the on who
pretend to be object in the sens of be liter and plai
strictli accord to the mark of express and admit littl
elast in the interpret of these ar also as rubinstein
point out subject at heart thi mai be more concis express
thu sinc all thing of perman valu in music have proceed from a
fervid artist imagin thei should be interpret with the
continu employ of the perform imagin
on the other hand the subject method right as it is in principl
can becom of cours accord to the italian sai traduttor
traditorethat is an absolut treacheri to the compos ideal if
the perform understand and execut of the composit is not
base upon long and care investig of all the fundament law
and associ branch of music studi which ar design to give him
a basi for form hi own opinion upon the best method of
interpret the composit inadequ train in thi respect is the
chines wall which surround the compos hidden mean thi wall
must be torn down brick by brick stone by stone in a manner which we
would call analyt practic it is the onli wai in which the
student mai gain entranc to the sacr citi of the elect to whom the
ideal of the compos ha been reveal
the interpret must coper with the compos
in a certain sens the interpret is a coper with the compos
or more definit express he is the continu along the line of
the music thought and it adequ express music of all art is
the unfinish art when a great paint is complet time and time
onli will make the chang in it surfac when the great masterpiec
left the brush of raphael ruben holbein correggio or van dyck thei
were finish work of art when bach beethoven chopin and brahm put
their thought down upon paper thei left a record in ink and paper which
must be born again everi time it is brought to the mind of men thi
rebirth is the veri essenc of all that is best in interpret skill
new life goe into the composit at the veri moment it pass through
the soul of the master perform it is here that he should realiz the
great truth that in music more than in ani other art the letter kill
and the spirit vivifi the interpret must master the letter and
seek to give rebirth to the spirit if he can do thi he will attain
the greatest in interpret abil
from the liter or object standpoint then an insight is gain
into the natur of the compos masterpiecebi close and care
studi of the work itself by gain a knowledg of the music law
underli the structur and composit of a work of it kind as well
as the necessari keyboard technic to give express to the workbut
the veil is torn from the compos hidden mean onli becom
intim with hi creativ person as a master by studi hi life
environ by investig the histor background of the period
in which he work by learn of hi joi and hi suffer by
cultiv a deep and heartfelt sympathi for hi ideal and by the
scrupul and constant revis of on own ideal and concept of
the standard by which hi masterpiec should be judg
studi the histor background
to exemplifi what i mean i could for instanc refer to paderewski
interpret of liszt and chopin dure the time i wa associ
with the master pianist as a pupil i had abund opportun to make
note upon the veri individu as well as the highli artist
differenti express of hi music judgment it wa interest
to observ that he plai the rhapsodi with variou extens and
modif the result of which is the glorif of liszt own
spirit on the contrari in order to preserv chopin spirit the
master would alwai repudi ani chang like those of tausig for
instanc by which some virtuoso pretend to emphas or modern
chopin person and perfect pianism differ in treatment ar the
outcom of deep insight as well as the studi of the time and condit
under which the work wa produc
the studi of music histori reveal mani veri signific thing which
have a direct bear not onli upon the interpret of the perform
but upon the degre of appreci with which the listen is abl to
enjoi a music work it wa for thi reason that i prefac the first
two recit of my cours of histor recit given at mendelssohn
hall new york dure the past season with a lectur upon the
histor condit which surround the master at the time the
composit were compos
the inadequaci of music sign
i have alreadi refer to the inadequaci of music sign even the
mechan guid the metronom is not alwai to be depend upon to
give the exact tempo the compos had in mind let me cite a littl
instanc from the biographi of ri the friend of beethoven ri wa
prepar to conduct a perform of the beethoven ninth symphoni he
request beethoven to make note upon paper regard the metronom
mark of speed at which the composit should be plai the metronom
at that time wa a compar new instrument maelzel it inventor
or rather it improv sinc the principl of the metronom wa of
dutch origin wa a friend of beethoven at time thei were on the best
of term and at other time thei were liter at sword point
nevertheless maelzel who had a strong person succeed in
induc beethoven to put metronom mark upon sever of hi
composit natur the metronom wa immedi accord an
import place in the music world even at that dai ri wa
consequ veri anxiou to give the choral symphoni accord to
beethoven own idea beethoven had compli with the publish
desir and sent a slip of paper with the tempi mark metronom
thi slip wa lost ri wrote to beethoven for a duplic beethoven
sent anoth later the lost slip wa found and upon compar it with
the second slip it wa found that beethoven had made an entir
differ estim of the tempi at which he desir the symphoni to be
plai
even with the most elabor and complet mark of express such as
those for instanc emploi by beethoven and by wagner the compos
is confront with hi great poverti of resourc to present hi view
to the mind of the interpret extens as some of the modern
dictionari of music terminolog seem to be thei ar wholli
inadequ from the standpoint of a complet vocabulari to give full
express to the artist imagin it also give full scope to an
infinit varieti of error in the matter of the shade or degre of
dynam forc at which the convent mark mai be render
on might ventur to remark that compos ar the most keen most
consciou judg of their own work or rather of the garment which
fit them best there is in all composit a divin part and also a
consciou part the divin part is the inspir the consciou part
ha to do with dress the inspir in it most appropri
harmon polyphon and rhythmic garment these garment ar the
raiment in which the inspir will be view by futur gener
it is often by these garment that thei will be judg if the garment
ar awkward inappropri and illfit a beauti interpret
of the compos ideal will be imposs nevertheless it is the
perform duti in each case to try to see through even unbecom
garment and divin the compos thought accord to the
interpret best understand
learn the music languag
where interpret is concern on is too often inclin to forget
that while there is a higher part the secret of which ar access
onli to the elect there is also an elementari part which involv the
knowledg of music grammar and beyond that the correct feel of
music declamationsinc music after all is a languag which is at
all time perfectli teachabl and which should be most carefulli and
systemat taught i consid the book of mathi lussi rhythm and
music express of great valu to the student in search of truth
pertain to intellig interpret lussi wa a swiss who wa born
in the earli part of the last centuri he went to pari to studi
medicin but have had a music train in the countri of hi
birth he becam a good pianofort teacher and an excel writer upon
music subject while teach in a young ladi school he wa
confront with the great pauciti of real knowledg of the rudiment of
express and he accordingli prepar a book upon the subject which
ha sinc been translat into sever languag thi book is most
help and i advoc it us frequent it should be in the hand of
everi conscienti piano student
mistak peculiar to the pianofort player
the natur of the keyboard of the piano and the eas with which certain
thing ar accomplish make it possibl for the perform to make
certain error which the construct of other instrument would
prevent the pianist is for instanc entir unlik the violinist
who ha to locat hi keyboard everi time he take up hi instrument
and moreov locat it by a highli train sens of posit in a
certain wai i sometim feel somewhat asham for the pianist profess
when i hear player even those with manifest technic profici
commit flagrant mistak against elementari rule of accentu and
phrase such as for instanc an averag violinist acquaint with
good bow is accordingli prevent from make upon hi instrument
the mean of discov the compos hidden mean ar in fact so
numer that the conscienti interpret must keep upon continu
voyag of explor there ar mani easili recogniz path lead
to the promis landon is the path of harmoni without an
understand of which the wouldb perform can never reach hi goal
anoth is music histori other ar the studi of phrase rhythm
