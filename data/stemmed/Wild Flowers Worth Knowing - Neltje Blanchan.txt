let us not note for the present what happen in the older flower but

yale blue sprengel who made a most elabor studi of the violet
condens the result of hi research into the follow question and
answer which ar given here becaus much that he sai appli to our
own nativ speci which have been too littl studi in the modern
scientif spirit
1 why is the flower situat on a long stalk which is upright but
curv downward at the free end in order that it mai hang down which
firstli prevent rain from obtain access to the nectar and
secondli place the stamen in such a posit that the pollen fall
into the open space between the pistil and the free end of the stamen
if the flower were upright the pollen would fall into the space
between the base of the stamen and the base of the pistil and would not
come in contact with the bee
2 why doe the pollen differ from that of most other insectfertil
flower in most of such flower the insect themselv remov the
pollen from the anther and it is therefor import that the pollen
should not easili be detach and carri awai by the wind in the
present case on the contrari it is desir that it should be looser
and drier so that it mai easili fall into the space between the stamen
and the pistil if it remain attach to the anther it would not be
touch by the bee and the flower would remain unfertil
3 why is the base of the style so thin in order that the bee mai be
more easili abl to bend the style
4 why is the base of the style bent for the same reason the result
of the curvatur is that the pistil is much more easili bent than would
be the case if the style were straight
5 final why doe the membran termin of the upper filament
overlap the correspond portion of the two middl stamen becaus
thi enabl the bee to move the pistil and therebi to set free the
pollen more easili than would be the case under the revers
