chapter i
childhood and earli educ
it seem proper that i should prefix to the follow biograph sketch
some mention of the reason which have made me think it desir that i
should leav behind me such a memori of so unev a life as mine
i do not for a moment imagin that ani part of what i have to relat can
be interest to the public as a narr or as be connect with
myself but i have thought that in an ag in which educ and it
improv ar the subject of more if not of profound studi than at
ani former period of english histori it mai be us that there should
be some record of an educ which wa unusu and remark and
which whatev els it mai have done ha prove how much more than is
commonli suppos mai be taught and well taught in those earli year
which in the common mode of what is call instruct ar littl
better than wast it ha also seem to me that in an ag of transit
in opinion there mai be somewhat both of interest and of benefit in
note the success phase of ani mind which wa alwai press forward
equal readi to learn and to unlearn either from it own thought or from
those of other but a motiv which weigh more with me than either of
these is a desir to make acknowledg of the debt which my
intellectu and moral develop ow to other person some of them of
recognis emin other less known than thei deserv to be and the
on to whom most of all is due on whom the world had no opportun of
know the reader whom these thing do not interest ha onli himself to
blame if he read farther and i do not desir ani other indulg from
him than that of bear in mind that for him these page were not written
i wa born in london on the 20th of mai 1806 and wa the eldest son
of jame mill the author of the histori of british india my father
the son of a petti tradesman and i believ small farmer at northwat
bridg in the counti of angu wa when a boi recommend by hi
abil to the notic of sir john stuart of fettercairn on of the
baron of the exchequ in scotland and wa in consequ sent to
the univers of edinburgh at the expens of a fund establish by
ladi jane stuart the wife of sir john stuart and some other ladi
for educ young men for the scottish church he there went through
the usual cours of studi and wa licens as a preacher but never
follow the profess have satisfi himself that he could not
believ the doctrin of that or ani other church for a few year he
wa a privat tutor in variou famili in scotland among other that
of the marqui of tweeddal but end by take up hi resid in
london and devot himself to authorship nor had he ani other mean
of support until 1819 when he obtain an appoint in the india hous
in thi period of my father life there ar two thing which it is
imposs not to be struck with on of them unfortun a veri
common circumst the other a most uncommon on the first is that
in hi posit with no resourc but the precari on of write in
period he marri and had a larg famili conduct than which
noth could be more oppos both as a matter of good sens and of
duti to the opinion which at least at a later period of life he
strenuous upheld the other circumst is the extraordinari
energi which wa requir to lead the life he led with the
disadvantag under which he labour from the first and with those
which he brought upon himself by hi marriag it would have been no
small thing had he done no more than to support himself and hi
famili dure so mani year by write without ever be in debt
or in ani pecuniari difficulti hold as he did opinion both in
polit and in religion which were more odiou to all person of
influenc and to the common run of prosper englishmen in that
gener than either befor or sinc and be not onli a man whom
noth would have induc to write against hi convict but on
who invari threw into everyth he wrote as much of hi
convict as he thought the circumst would in ani wai permit
be it must also be said on who never did anyth neglig
never undertook ani task literari or other on which he did not
conscienti bestow all the labour necessari for perform it
adequ but he with these burden on him plan commenc and
complet the histori of india and thi in the cours of about ten
year a shorter time than ha been occupi even by writer who had
no other employ in the product of almost ani other histor
work of equal bulk and of anyth approach to the same amount of
read and research and to thi is to be ad that dure the
whole period a consider part of almost everi dai wa emploi in
the instruct of hi children in the case of on of whom myself
he exert an amount of labour care and persever rare if
ever emploi for a similar purpos in endeavour to give
accord to hi own concept the highest order of intellectu
educ
a man who in hi own practic so vigor act up to the
principl of lose no time wa like to adher to the same rule
in the instruct of hi pupil i have no remembr of the time
when i began to learn greek i have been told that it wa when i wa
three year old my earliest recollect on the subject is that of
commit to memori what my father term vocabl be list of
common greek word with their signif in english which he
wrote out for me on card of grammar until some year later i
learnt no more than the inflect of the noun and verb but after
a cours of vocabl proceed at onc to translat and i faintli
rememb go through aesop fabl the first greek book which
i read the anabasi which i rememb better wa the second i
learnt no latin until my eighth year at that time i had read under
my father tuition a number of greek prose author among whom i
rememb the whole of herodotu and of xenophon cyropaedia and
memori of socrat some of the live of the philosoph by
diogen laertiu part of lucian and isocr ad demonicum and ad
nicoclem i also read in 1813 the first six dialogu in the common
arrang of plato from the euthyphron to the theoctetu inclus
which last dialogu i ventur to think would have been better omit
as it wa total imposs i should understand it but my father in
all hi teach demand of me not onli the utmost that i could do
but much that i could by no possibl have done what he wa himself
will to undergo for the sake of my instruct mai be judg from
the fact that i went through the whole process of prepar my greek
lesson in the same room and at the same tabl at which he wa write
and as in those dai greek and english lexicon were not and i could
make no more us of a greek and latin lexicon than could be made without
have yet begun to learn latin i wa forc to have recours to him
for the mean of everi word which i did not know thi incess
interrupt he on of the most impati of men submit to and
wrote under that interrupt sever volum of hi histori and all
els that he had to write dure those year
the onli thing besid greek that i learnt as a lesson in thi part
of my childhood wa arithmet thi also my father taught me it wa
the task of the even and i well rememb it disagre
but the lesson were onli a part of the daili instruct i receiv
much of it consist in the book i read by myself and my father
discours to me chiefli dure our walk from 1810 to the end of
1813 we were live in newington green then an almost rustic
neighbourhood my father health requir consider and constant
exercis and he walk habitu befor breakfast gener in the
green lane toward hornsei in these walk i alwai accompani him
and with my earliest recollect of green field and wild flower
is mingl that of the account i gave him daili of what i had read the
dai befor to the best of my remembr thi wa a voluntari rather
than a prescrib exercis i made note on slip of paper while
read and from these in the morn walk i told the stori to him
for the book were chiefli histori of which i read in thi manner
a great number robertson histori hume gibbon but my greatest
delight then and for long afterward wa watson philip the second
and third the heroic defenc of the knight of malta against the
turk and of the revolt provinc of the netherland against spain
excit in me an intens and last interest next to watson my
favourit histor read wa hook histori of rome of greec
i had seen at that time no regular histori except school abridg
and the last two or three volum of a translat of rollin
ancient histori begin with philip of macedon but i read with
great delight langhorn translat of plutarch in english histori
beyond the time at which hume leav off i rememb read burnet
histori of hi own time though i care littl for anyth in it
except the war and battl and the histor part of the annual
regist from the begin to about 1788 where the volum my
father borrow for me from mr bentham left off i felt a live
interest in freder of prussia dure hi difficulti and in paoli
the corsican patriot but when i came to the american war i took my
part like a child as i wa until set right by my father on the
wrong side becaus it wa call the english side in these frequent
talk about the book i read he us as opportun offer to give
me explan and idea respect civil govern moral
mental cultiv which he requir me afterward to restat to him
in my own word he also made me read and give him a verbal account of
mani book which would not have interest me suffici to induc me
to read them of myself among other millar histor view of the
english govern a book of great merit for it time and which he
highli valu mosheim ecclesiast histori mccri life of
john knox and even sewel and rutti histori of the quaker he wa
fond of put into my hand book which exhibit men of energi and
resourc in unusu circumst struggl against difficulti and
overcom them of such work i rememb beaver african memoranda
and collinss account of the first settlement of new south wale
two book which i never weari of read were anson voyag so
delight to most young person and a collect hawkesworth i
believ of voyag round the world in four volum begin with
drake and end with cook and bougainvil of children book ani
more than of playth i had scarc ani except an occasion gift
from a relat or acquaint among those i had robinson cruso
wa preemin and continu to delight me through all my boyhood
it wa no part howev of my father system to exclud book of
amus though he allow them veri sparingli of such book he
possess at that time next to none but he borrow sever for me
those which i rememb ar the arabian night cazott arabian
tale don quixot miss edgeworth popular tale and a book
of some reput in it dai brook fool of qualiti
in my eighth year i commenc learn latin in conjunct with a
younger sister to whom i taught it as i went on and who afterward
repeat the lesson to my father from thi time other sister and
brother be success ad as pupil a consider part of my
dai work consist of thi preparatori teach it wa a part which
i greatli dislik the more so as i wa held respons for the
lesson of my pupil in almost as full a sens as for my own i
howev deriv from thi disciplin the great advantag of learn
more thoroughli and retain more lastingli the thing which i wa
set to teach perhap too the practic it afford in explain
difficulti to other mai even at that ag have been us in
other respect the experi of my boyhood is not favour to the
plan of teach children by mean of on anoth the teach i
am sure is veri ineffici as teach and i well know that the
relat between teacher and taught is not a good moral disciplin
to either i went in thi manner through the latin grammar and a
consider part of corneliu nepo and caesar commentari but
afterward ad to the superintend of these lesson much longer
on of my own
in the same year in which i began latin i made my first commenc
in the greek poet with the iliad after i had made some progress in
thi my father put pope translat into my hand it wa the first
english vers i had care to read and it becam on of the book in
which for mani year i most delight i think i must have read it
from twenti to thirti time through i should not have thought it
worth while to mention a tast appar so natur to boyhood if i
had not as i think observ that the keen enjoy of thi brilliant
specimen of narr and versif is not so univers with boi
as i should have expect both a priori and from my individu
experi soon after thi time i commenc euclid and somewhat later
algebra still under my father tuition
from my eighth to my twelfth year the latin book which i rememb
read were the bucol of virgil and the first six book of the
aeneid all horac except the epod the fabl of phaedru the
first five book of livi to which from my love of the subject i
voluntarili ad in my hour of leisur the remaind of the first
decad all sallust a consider part of ovid metamorphos
some plai of terenc two or three book of lucretiu sever of the
orat of cicero and of hi write on oratori also hi letter
to atticu my father take the troubl to translat to me from the
french the histor explan in mingault note in greek i
read the iliad and odyssei through on or two plai of sophocl
euripid and aristophan though by these i profit littl all
thucydid the hellen of xenophon a great part of demosthen
aeschin and lysia theocritu anacreon part of the antholog
a littl of dionysiu sever book of polybiu and lastli
aristotl rhetor which as the first expressli scientif
treatis on ani moral or psycholog subject which i had read and
contain mani of the best observ of the ancient on human
natur and life my father made me studi with peculiar care and throw
the matter of it into synopt tabl dure the same year i learnt
elementari geometri and algebra thoroughli the differenti calculu
and other portion of the higher mathemat far from thoroughli for
my father not have kept up thi part of hi earli acquir
knowledg could not spare time to qualifi himself for remov my
difficulti and left me to deal with them with littl other aid
than that of book while i wa continu incur hi displeasur
by my inabl to solv difficult problem for which he did not see
that i had not the necessari previou knowledg
as to my privat read i can onli speak of what i rememb histori
continu to be my strongest predilect and most of all ancient
histori mitford greec i read continu my father had put me on
my guard against the tori prejudic of thi writer and hi
pervers of fact for the whitewash of despot and blacken
of popular institut these point he discours on exemplifi
them from the greek orat and historian with such effect that in
read mitford my sympathi were alwai on the contrari side to
those of the author and i could to some extent have argu the
point against him yet thi did not diminish the ever new pleasur
with which i read the book roman histori both in my old favourit
hook and in ferguson continu to delight me a book which in
spite of what is call the dryness of it style i took great
pleasur in wa the ancient univers histori through the
incess read of which i had my head full of histor detail
concern the obscurest ancient peopl while about modern histori
except detach passag such as the dutch war of independ i
knew and care compar littl a voluntari exercis to which
throughout my boyhood i wa much addict wa what i call write
histori i success compos a roman histori pick out
of hook and an abridg of the ancient univers histori a
histori of holland from my favourit watson and from an anonym
compil and in my eleventh and twelfth year i occupi myself
with write what i flatter myself wa someth seriou thi wa
no less than a histori of the roman govern compil with the
assist of hook from livi and dionysiu of which i wrote as much
as would have made an octavo volum extend to the epoch of the
licinian law it wa in fact an account of the struggl between
the patrician and plebeian which now engross all the interest in
my mind which i had previous felt in the mere war and conquest of
the roman i discuss all the constitut point as thei aros
though quit ignor of niebuhr research i by such light as my
father had given me vindic the agrarian law on the evid of
livi and upheld to the best of my abil the roman democrat
parti a few year later in my contempt of my childish effort i
destroi all these paper not then anticip that i could ever
feel ani curios about my first attempt at write and reason
my father encourag me in thi us amus though as i think
judici he never ask to see what i wrote so that i did not
feel that in write it i wa account to ani on nor had the
chill sensat of be under a critic ey
but though these exercis in histori were never a compulsori lesson
there wa anoth kind of composit which wa so name write
vers and it wa on of the most disagre of my task greek
and latin vers i did not write nor learnt the prosodi of those
languag my father think thi not worth the time it requir
content himself with make me read aloud to him and correct
fals quantiti i never compos at all in greek even in prose and
but littl in latin not that my father could be indiffer to the
valu of thi practic in give a thorough knowledg of these
languag but becaus there realli wa not time for it the vers
i wa requir to write were english when i first read pope homer
i ambiti attempt to compos someth of the same kind and
achiev as much as on book of a continu of the iliad there
probabl the spontan prompt of my poetic ambit would
have stop but the exercis begun from choic wa continu by
command conform to my father usual practic of explain to
me as far as possibl the reason for what he requir me to do
he gave me for thi as i well rememb two reason highli
characterist of him on wa that some thing could be express
better and more forcibl in vers than in prose thi he said wa
a real advantag the other wa that peopl in gener attach more
valu to vers than it deserv and the power of write it wa on
thi account worth acquir he gener left me to choos my own
subject which as far as i rememb were mostli address to some
mytholog personag or allegor abstract but he made me
translat into english vers mani of horac shorter poem i also
rememb hi give me thomson winter to read and afterward
make me attempt without book to write someth myself on the same
subject the vers i wrote were of cours the merest rubbish nor
did i ever attain ani facil of versif but the practic mai
have been us in make it easier for me at a later period to
acquir readi of expression1 i had read up to thi time veri
littl english poetri shakspear my father had put into my hand
chiefli for the sake of the histor plai from which howev
i went on to the other my father never wa a great admir of
shakspear the english idolatri of whom he us to attack with some
sever he care littl for ani english poetri except milton for
whom he had the highest admir goldsmith burn and grai
bard which he prefer to hi elegi perhap i mai add cowper and
beatti he had some valu for spenser and i rememb hi read to
me unlik hi usual practic of make me read to him the first book
of the fairi queen but i took littl pleasur in it the poetri
of the present centuri he saw scarc ani merit in and i hardli
becam acquaint with ani of it till i wa grown up to manhood
except the metric romanc of walter scott which i read at hi
recommend and wa intens delight with as i alwai wa with
anim narr dryden poem were among my father book and
mani of these he made me read but i never care for ani of them
except alexand feast which as well as mani of the song
in walter scott i us to sing intern to a music of my own to
some of the latter inde i went so far as to compos air which
i still rememb cowper short poem i read with some pleasur but
never got far into the longer on and noth in the two volum
interest me like the prose account of hi three hare in my
thirteenth year i met with campbel poem among which lochiel
hohenlinden the exil of erin and some other gave me
sensat i had never befor experienc from poetri here too
i made noth of the longer poem except the strike open of
gertrud of wyom which long kept it place in my feel as
the perfect of patho
dure thi part of my childhood on of my greatest amus wa
experiment scienc in the theoret howev not the practic
sens of the word not try experimentsa kind of disciplin which
i have often regret not have hadnor even see but mere
read about them i never rememb be so wrapt up in ani book as
i wa in joyc scientif dialogu and i wa rather recalcitr
to my father critic of the bad reason respect the first
principl of physic which abound in the earli part of that work i
devour treatis on chemistri especi that of my father earli
friend and schoolfellow dr thomson for year befor i attend a
lectur or saw an experi
from about the ag of twelv i enter into anoth and more advanc
stage in my cours of instruct in which the main object wa no
longer the aid and applianc of thought but the thought themselv
thi commenc with logic in which i began at onc with the organon
and read it to the analyt inclus but profit littl by the
posterior analyt which belong to a branch of specul i wa not
yet ripe for contemporan with the organon my father made me
read the whole or part of sever of the latin treatis on the
scholast logic give each dai to him in our walk a minut account
of what i had read and answer hi numer and most search
question after thi i went in a similar manner through the computatio
sive logica of hobb a work of a much higher order of thought than the
book of the school logician and which he estim veri highli in my
own opinion beyond it merit great as these ar it wa hi invari
practic whatev studi he exact from me to make me as far as
possibl understand and feel the util of them and thi he deem
peculiarli fit in the case of the syllogist logic the us
of which had been impugn by so mani writer of author i well
rememb how and in what particular walk in the neighbourhood of bagshot
heath where we were on a visit to hi old friend mr wallac then on
of the mathemat professor at sandhurst he first attempt by
question to make me think on the subject and frame some concept of
what constitut the util of the syllogist logic and when i had
fail in thi to make me understand it by explan the
explan did not make the matter at all clear to me at the time
but thei were not therefor useless thei remain as a nucleu for my
observ and reflect to crystal upon the import of hi
gener remark be interpret to me by the particular instanc
which came under my notic afterward my own conscious and
experi ultim led me to appreci quit as highli as he did
the valu of an earli practic familiar with the school logic
i know of noth in my educ to which i think myself more
indebt for whatev capac of think i have attain the first
intellectu oper in which i arriv at ani profici wa
dissect a bad argument and find in what part the fallaci lai
and though whatev capac of thi sort i attain wa due to the
fact that it wa an intellectu exercis in which i wa most
perseveringli drill by my father yet it is also true that the
school logic and the mental habit acquir in studi it were
among the princip instrument of thi drill i am persuad that
noth in modern educ tend so much when properli us to
form exact thinker who attach a precis mean to word and
proposit and ar not impos on by vagu loos or ambigu
term the boast influenc of mathemat studi is noth to
it for in mathemat process none of the real difficulti of
correct ratiocin occur it is also a studi peculiarli adapt to
an earli stage in the educ of philosoph student sinc it
doe not presuppos the slow process of acquir by experi and
reflect valuabl thought of their own thei mai becom capabl
of disentangl the intricaci of confus and selfcontradictori
thought befor their own think faculti ar much advanc a
power which for want of some such disciplin mani otherwis abl
men altogeth lack and when thei have to answer oppon onli
endeavour by such argument as thei can command to support the
opposit conclus scarc even attempt to confut the
reason of their antagonist and therefor at the utmost
leav the question as far as it depend on argument a balanc on
dure thi time the latin and greek book which i continu to read
with my father were chiefli such as were worth studi not for the
languag mere but also for the thought thi includ much of the
orat and especi demosthen some of whose princip orat
i read sever time over and wrote out by wai of exercis a full
analysi of them my father comment on these orat when i read
them to him were veri instruct to me he not onli drew my attent
to the insight thei afford into athenian institut and the
principl of legisl and govern which thei often illustr
but point out the skill and art of the oratorhow everyth
import to hi purpos wa said at the exact moment when he had
brought the mind of hi audienc into the state most fit to
receiv it how he made steal into their mind gradual and by
insinu thought which if express in a more direct manner
would have rous their opposit most of these reflect were
beyond my capac of full comprehens at the time but thei left
seed behind which germin in due season at thi time i also read
the whole of tacitu juven and quintilian the latter ow to
hi obscur style and to the scholast detail of which mani part
of hi treatis ar made up is littl read and seldom suffici
appreci hi book is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thought of
the ancient on the whole field of educ and cultur and i have
retain through life mani valuabl idea which i can distinctli trace
to my read of him even at that earli ag it wa at thi period
that i read for the first time some of the most import dialogu
of plato in particular the gorgia the protagora and the
republ there is no author to whom my father thought himself more
indebt for hi own mental cultur than plato or whom he more
frequent recommend to young student i can bear similar testimoni
in regard to myself the socrat method of which the platon
dialogu ar the chief exampl is unsurpass as a disciplin for
correct the error and clear up the confus incid to the
intellectu sibi permissu the understand which ha made up all
it bundl of associ under the guidanc of popular phraseolog
the close search elenchu by which the man of vagu gener
is constrain either to express hi mean to himself in definit
term or to confess that he doe not know what he is talk about
the perpetu test of all gener statement by particular instanc
the sieg in form which is laid to the mean of larg abstract term
by fix upon some still larger classnam which includ that and more
and divid down to the thing soughtmark out it limit and
definit by a seri of accur drawn distinct between it and
each of the cognat object which ar success part off from it
all thi as an educ for precis think is inestim and
all thi even at that ag took such hold of me that it becam part of
my own mind i have felt ever sinc that the titl of platonist belong
by far better right to those who have been nourish in and have
endeavour to practis plato mode of investig than to those
who ar distinguish onli by the adopt of certain dogmat
conclus drawn mostli from the least intellig of hi work and
which the charact of hi mind and write make it uncertain whether
he himself regard as anyth more than poetic fanci or philosoph
conjectur
in go through plato and demosthen sinc i could now read these
author as far as the languag wa concern with perfect eas i
wa not requir to constru them sentenc by sentenc but to read
them aloud to my father answer question when ask but the
particular attent which he paid to elocut in which hi own
excel wa remark made thi read aloud to him a most
pain task of all thing which he requir me to do there wa none
which i did so constantli ill or in which he so perpetu lost hi
temper with me he had thought much on the principl of the art of
read especi the most neglect part of it the inflect of
the voic or modul as writer on elocut call it in
contrast with articul on the on side and express on the
other and had reduc it to rule ground on the logic analysi
of a sentenc these rule he strongli impress upon me and took me
sever to task for everi violat of them but i even then remark
though i did not ventur to make the remark to him that though he
reproach me when i read a sentenc ill and told me how i ought to
have read it he never by read it himself show me how it ought
to be read a defect run through hi otherwis admir mode of
instruct as it did through all hi mode of thought wa that of
trust too much to the intellig of the abstract when not
embodi in the concret it wa at a much later period of my youth
when practis elocut by myself or with companion of my own ag
that i for the first time understood the object of hi rule and saw
the psycholog ground of them at that time i and other follow
out the subject into it ramif and could have compos a veri
us treatis ground on my father principl he himself left
those principl and rule unwritten i regret that when my mind wa
full of the subject from systemat practic i did not put them and
our improv of them into a formal shape
a book which contribut larg to my educ in the best sens of
the term wa my father histori of india it wa publish in the
begin of 1818 dure the year previou while it wa pass
through the press i us to read the proof sheet to him or rather
i read the manuscript to him while he correct the proof the number
of new idea which i receiv from thi remark book and the
impuls and stimulu as well as guidanc given to my thought by it
critic and disquisit on societi and civil in the hindoo
part on institut and the act of govern in the english part
made my earli familiar with it emin us to my subsequ
progress and though i can perceiv defici in it now as compar
with a perfect standard i still think it if not the most on of the
most instruct histori ever written and on of the book from
which most benefit mai be deriv by a mind in the cours of make up
it opinion
the prefac among the most characterist of my father write as
well as the richest in materi of thought give a pictur which mai
be entir depend on of the sentiment and expect with which
he wrote the histori satur as the book is with the opinion and
mode of judgment of a democrat radic then regard as extrem
and treat with a sever at that time most unusu the english
constitut the english law and all parti and class who
possess ani consider influenc in the countri he mai have
expect reput but certainli not advanc in life from it
public nor could he have suppos that it would rais up anyth
but enemi for him in power quarter least of all could he have
expect favour from the east india compani to whose commerci
privileg he wa unqualifiedli hostil and on the act of whose
govern he had made so mani sever comment though in variou part
of hi book he bore a testimoni in their favour which he felt to be
their just due name that no govern had on the whole given so much
proof to the extent of it light of good intent toward it subject
and that if the act of ani other govern had the light of public

on learn howev in the spring of 1819 about a year after the
public of the histori that the east india director desir to
strengthen the part of their home establish which wa emploi in
carri on the correspond with india my father declar himself
a candid for that employ and to the credit of the director
successfulli he wa appoint on of the assist of the examin
of india correspond offic whose duti it wa to prepar draft
of despatch to india for consider by the director in the
princip depart of administr in thi offic and in that
of examin which he subsequ attain the influenc which hi
talent hi reput and hi decis of charact gave him with
superior who realli desir the good govern of india enabl him
to a great extent to throw into hi draft of despatch and to carri
through the ordeal of the court of director and board of control
without have their forc much weaken hi real opinion on indian
subject in hi histori he had set forth for the first time mani of
the true principl of indian administr and hi despatch
follow hi histori did more than had ever been done befor to
promot the improv of india and teach indian offici to
understand their busi if a select of them were publish thei
would i am convinc place hi charact as a practic statesman
fulli on a level with hi emin as a specul writer
thi new employ of hi time caus no relax in hi attent to
my educ it wa in thi same year 1819 that he took me through a
complet cours of polit economi hi love and intim friend
ricardo had shortli befor publish the book which form so great an
epoch in polit economi a book which would never have been publish
or written but for the entreati and strong encourag of my father
for ricardo the most modest of men though firmli convinc of the
truth of hi doctrin deem himself so littl capabl of do them
justic in exposit and express that he shrank from the idea of
public the same friendli encourag induc ricardo a year or
two later to becom a member of the hous of common where dure the
remain year of hi life unhappili cut short in the full vigour of
hi intellect he render so much servic to hi and my father
opinion both on polit economi and on other subject
though ricardo great work wa alreadi in print no didact treatis
embodi it doctrin in a manner fit for learner had yet appear
my father therefor commenc instruct me in the scienc by a sort
of lectur which he deliv to me in our walk he expound each
dai a portion of the subject and i gave him next dai a written account
of it which he made me rewrit over and over again until it wa clear
precis and toler complet in thi manner i went through the whole
extent of the scienc and the written outlin of it which result from
my daili compt rendu serv him afterward as note from which to
write hi element of polit economi after thi i read ricardo
give an account daili of what i read and discuss in the best
manner i could the collater point which offer themselv in our
progress
on monei as the most intric part of the subject he made me read
in the same manner ricardo admir pamphlet written dure what
wa call the bullion controversi to these succeed adam smith and
in thi read it wa on of my father main object to make me
appli to smith more superfici view of polit economi the
superior light of ricardo and detect what wa fallaci in smith
argument or erron in ani of hi conclus such a mode of
instruct wa excel calcul to form a thinker but it
requir to be work by a thinker as close and vigor as my
father the path wa a thorni on even to him and i am sure it wa
so to me notwithstand the strong interest i took in the subject
he wa often and much beyond reason provok by my failur in case
where success could not have been expect but in the main hi method
wa right and it succeed i do not believ that ani scientif
teach ever wa more thorough or better fit for train the
faculti than the mode in which logic and polit economi were
taught to me by my father strive even in an exagger degre
to call forth the activ of my faculti by make me find out
everyth for myself he gave hi explan not befor but after
i had felt the full forc of the difficulti and not onli gave me an
accur knowledg of these two great subject as far as thei were
then understood but made me a thinker on both i thought for myself
almost from the first and occasion thought differ from him
though for a long time onli on minor point and make hi opinion
the ultim standard at a later period i even occasion convinc
him and alter hi opinion on some point of detail which i state
to hi honour not my own it at onc exemplifi hi perfect candour
and the real worth of hi method of teach
at thi point conclud what can properli be call my lesson when i
wa about fourteen i left england for more than a year and after my
return though my studi went on under my father gener direct
he wa no longer my schoolmast i shall therefor paus here and
turn back to matter of a more gener natur connect with the part
of my life and educ includ in the preced reminisc
in the cours of instruct which i have partial retrac the
point most superfici appar is the great effort to give dure
the year of childhood an amount of knowledg in what ar consid
the higher branch of educ which is seldom acquir if
acquir at all until the ag of manhood the result of the experi
show the eas with which thi mai be done and place in a strong
light the wretch wast of so mani preciou year as ar spent in
acquir the modicum of latin and greek commonli taught to schoolboi
a wast which ha led so mani educ reform to entertain the
illjudg propos of discard these languag altogeth from
gener educ if i had been by natur extrem quick of
apprehens or had possess a veri accur and retent memori
or were of a remark activ and energet charact the trial
would not be conclus but in all these natur gift i am rather
below than abov par what i could do could assuredli be done by ani
boi or girl of averag capac and healthi physic constitut and
if i have accomplish anyth i ow it among other fortun
circumst to the fact that through the earli train bestow on
me by my father i start i mai fairli sai with an advantag of a
quarter of a centuri over my contemporari
there wa on cardin point in thi train of which i have alreadi
given some indic and which more than anyth els wa the
caus of whatev good it effect most boi or youth who have had
much knowledg drill into them have their mental capac not
strengthen but overlaid by it thei ar cram with mere fact
and with the opinion or phrase of other peopl and these ar
accept as a substitut for the power to form opinion of their own
and thu the son of emin father who have spare no pain in
their educ so often grow up mere parrot of what thei have
learnt incap of us their mind except in the furrow trace
for them mine howev wa not an educ of cram my father never
permit anyth which i learnt to degener into a mere exercis
of memori he strove to make the understand not onli go along with
everi step of the teach but if possibl preced it anyth
which could be found out by think i never wa told until i had
exhaust my effort to find it out for myself as far as i can trust
my remembr i acquit myself veri lame in thi depart my
recollect of such matter is almost wholli of failur hardli ever
of success it is true the failur were often in thing in which
success in so earli a stage of my progress wa almost imposs
i rememb at some time in my thirteenth year on my happen to
us the word idea he ask me what an idea wa and express some
displeasur at my ineffectu effort to defin the word i recollect
also hi indign at my us the common express that someth
wa true in theori but requir correct in practic and how after
make me vainli strive to defin the word theori he explain it
mean and show the fallaci of the vulgar form of speech which i
had us leav me fulli persuad that in be unabl to give a
correct definit of theori and in speak of it as someth which
might be at varianc with practic i had shown unparallel ignor
in thi he seem and perhap wa veri unreason but i think onli
in be angri at my failur a pupil from whom noth is ever demand
which he cannot do never doe all he can
on of the evil most liabl to attend on ani sort of earli profici
and which often fatal blight it promis my father most anxious
guard against thi wa selfconceit he kept me with extrem
vigil out of the wai of hear myself prais or of be led
to make selfflatt comparison between myself and other from
hi own intercours with me i could deriv none but a veri humbl
opinion of myself and the standard of comparison he alwai held up to
me wa not what other peopl did but what a man could and ought to
do he complet succeed in preserv me from the sort of influenc
he so much dread i wa not at all awar that my attain were
anyth unusu at my ag if i accident had my attent drawn to
the fact that some other boi knew less than myselfwhich happen less
often than might be imaginedi conclud not that i knew much but that
he for some reason or other knew littl or that hi knowledg wa of
a differ kind from mine my state of mind wa not humil but neither
wa it arrog i never thought of sai to myself i am or i can do
so and so i neither estim myself highli nor lowli i did not estim
myself at all if i thought anyth about myself it wa that i wa
rather backward in my studi sinc i alwai found myself so in
comparison with what my father expect from me i assert thi with
confid though it wa not the impress of variou person who saw
me in my childhood thei as i have sinc found thought me greatli and
disagre selfconceit probabl becaus i wa disputati and did
not scrupl to give direct contradict to thing which i heard said
i suppos i acquir thi bad habit from have been encourag in an
unusu degre to talk on matter beyond my ag and with grown person
while i never had inculc on me the usual respect for them my father
did not correct thi illbreed and impertin probabl from not
be awar of it for i wa alwai too much in aw of him to be otherwis
than extrem subdu and quiet in hi presenc yet with all thi i had
no notion of ani superior in myself and well wa it for me that i had
not i rememb the veri place in hyde park where in my fourteenth year
on the ev of leav my father hous for a long absenc he told me
that i should find as i got acquaint with new peopl that i had been
taught mani thing which youth of my ag did not commonli know and that
mani person would be dispos to talk to me of thi and to compliment
me upon it what other thing he said on thi topic i rememb veri
imperfectli but he wound up by sai that whatev i knew more than
other could not be ascrib to ani merit in me but to the veri unusu
advantag which had fallen to my lot of have a father who wa abl to
teach me and will to give the necessari troubl and time that it wa
no matter of prais to me if i knew more than those who had not had a
similar advantag but the deepest disgrac to me if i did not i have a
distinct remembr that the suggest thu for the first time made to
me that i knew more than other youth who were consid well educ
wa to me a piec of inform to which as to all other thing which
my father told me i gave implicit credenc but which did not at all
impress me as a person matter i felt no disposit to glorifi myself
upon the circumst that there were other person who did not know what
i knew nor had i ever flatter myself that my acquir whatev
thei might be were ani merit of mine but now when my attent wa
call to the subject i felt that what my father had said respect my
peculiar advantag wa exactli the truth and common sens of the matter
and it fix my opinion and feel from that time forward
chapter ii
moral influenc in earli youth my father charact and opinion
in my educ as in that of everyon the moral influenc which
ar so much more import than all other ar also the most
complic and the most difficult to specifi with ani approach to
complet without attempt the hopeless task of detail the
circumst by which in thi respect my earli charact mai have
been shape i shall confin myself to a few lead point which
form an indispens part of ani true account of my educ
i wa brought up from the first without ani religi belief in the
ordinari accept of the term my father educ in the creed of
scotch presbyterian had by hi own studi and reflect been
earli led to reject not onli the belief in revel but the
foundat of what is commonli call natur religion i have heard
him sai that the turn point of hi mind on the subject wa read
butler analog that work of which he alwai continu to speak
with respect kept him as he said for some consider time a
believ in the divin author of christian by prove to him
that whatev ar the difficulti in believ that the old and new
testament proce from or record the act of a perfectli wise and
good be the same and still greater difficulti stand in the wai
of the belief that a be of such a charact can have been the
maker of the univers he consid butler argument as conclus
against the onli oppon for whom it wa intend those who admit
an omnipot as well as perfectli just and benevol maker and ruler
of such a world as thi can sai littl against christian but what
can with at least equal forc be retort against themselv
find therefor no halt place in deism he remain in a state
of perplex until doubtless after mani struggl he yield to
the convict that concern the origin of thing noth whatev
can be known thi is the onli correct statement of hi opinion for
dogmat atheism he look upon as absurd as most of those whom the
world ha consid atheist have alwai done these particular ar
import becaus thei show that my father reject of all that is
call religi belief wa not as mani might suppos primarili a
matter of logic and evid the ground of it were moral still more
than intellectu he found it imposs to believ that a world so
full of evil wa the work of an author combin infinit power with
perfect good and righteous hi intellect spurn the
subtleti by which men attempt to blind themselv to thi open
contradict the sabaean or manichaean theori of a good and an evil
principl struggl against each other for the govern of the
univers he would not have equal condemn and i have heard him
express surpris that no on reviv it in our time he would have
regard it as a mere hypothesi but he would have ascrib to it no
deprav influenc as it wa hi avers to religion in the sens
usual attach to the term wa of the same kind with that of
lucretiu he regard it with the feel due not to a mere mental
delus but to a great moral evil he look upon it as the greatest
enemi of moral first by set up fictiti excellencesbelief
in creed devot feel and ceremoni not connect with the
good of humankindand caus these to be accept as substitut
for genuin virtu but abov all by radic vitiat the
standard of moral make it consist in do the will of a be
on whom it lavish inde all the phrase of adul but whom in
sober truth it depict as emin hate i have a hundr time
heard him sai that all ag and nation have repres their god as
wick in a constantli increas progress that mankind have gone
on ad trait after trait till thei reach the most perfect
concept of wicked which the human mind can devis and have
call thi god and prostrat themselv befor it thi ne plu
ultra of wicked he consid to be embodi in what is commonli
present to mankind as the creed of christian think he us to
sai of a be who would make a hellwho would creat the human race
with the infal foreknowledg and therefor with the intent
that the great major of them were to be consign to horribl and
everlast torment the time i believ is draw near when thi
dread concept of an object of worship will be no longer
identifi with christian and when all person with ani sens of
moral good and evil will look upon it with the same indign with
which my father regard it my father wa as well awar as anyon
that christian do not in gener undergo the demor
consequ which seem inher in such a creed in the manner or
to the extent which might have been expect from it the same
slovenli of thought and subject of the reason to fear
wish and affect which enabl them to accept a theori involv
a contradict in term prevent them from perceiv the logic
consequ of the theori such is the facil with which mankind
believ at on and the same time thing inconsist with on anoth
and so few ar those who draw from what thei receiv as truth ani
consequ but those recommend to them by their feel that
multitud have held the undoubt belief in an omnipot author
of hell and have nevertheless identifi that be with the best
concept thei were abl to form of perfect good their worship
wa not paid to the demon which such a be as thei imagin would
realli be but to their own ideal of excel the evil is that
such a belief keep the ideal wretchedli low and oppos the most
obstin resist to all thought which ha a tendenc to rais it
higher believ shrink from everi train of idea which would lead
the mind to a clear concept and an elev standard of excel
becaus thei feel even when thei do not distinctli see that such a
standard would conflict with mani of the dispens of natur and
with much of what thei ar accustom to consid as the christian
creed and thu moral continu a matter of blind tradit with
no consist principl nor even ani consist feel to guid it
it would have been wholli inconsist with my father idea of duti
to allow me to acquir impress contrari to hi convict and
feel respect religion and he impress upon me from the first
that the manner in which the world came into exist wa a subject
on which noth wa known that the question who made me cannot
be answer becaus we have no experi or authent inform
from which to answer it and that ani answer onli throw the difficulti
a step further back sinc the question immedi present itself
who made god he at the same time took care that i should be
acquaint with what had been thought by mankind on these impenetr
problem i have mention at how earli an ag he made me a reader of
ecclesiast histori and he taught me to take the strongest interest
in the reform as the great and decis contest against priestli
tyranni for liberti of thought
i am thu on of the veri few exampl in thi countri of on who ha
not thrown off religi belief but never had it i grew up in a
neg state with regard to it i look upon the modern exactli as
i did upon the ancient religion as someth which in no wai concern
me it did not seem to me more strang that english peopl should believ
what i did not than that the men i read of in herodotu should have done
so histori had made the varieti of opinion among mankind a fact familiar
to me and thi wa but a prolong of that fact thi point in my
earli educ had howev incident on bad consequ deserv
notic in give me an opinion contrari to that of the world my father
thought it necessari to give it as on which could not prudent be avow
to the world thi lesson of keep my thought to myself at that earli
ag wa attend with some moral disadvantag though my limit
intercours with stranger especi such as were like to speak to
me on religion prevent me from be place in the altern of
avow or hypocrisi i rememb two occas in my boyhood on which i
felt myself in thi altern and in both case i avow my disbelief
and defend it my oppon were boi consider older than myself
on of them i certainli stagger at the time but the subject wa never
renew between us the other who wa surpris and somewhat shock did
hi best to convinc me for some time without effect
the great advanc in liberti of discuss which is on of the most
import differ between the present time and that of my childhood
ha greatli alter the moral of thi question and i think that
few men of my father intellect and public spirit hold with such
intens of moral convict as he did unpopular opinion on religion
or on ani other of the great subject of thought would now either
practis or inculc the withhold of them from the world unless in
the case becom fewer everi dai in which frank on these subject
would either risk the loss of mean of subsist or would amount to
exclus from some sphere of us peculiarli suitabl to the
capac of the individu on religion in particular the time appear
to me to have come when it is the duti of all who be qualifi in
point of knowledg have on matur consider satisfi themselv
that the current opinion ar not onli fals but hurt to make their
dissent known at least if thei ar among those whose station or
reput give their opinion a chanc of be attend to such an
avow would put an end at onc and for ever to the vulgar prejudic
that what is call veri improperli unbelief is connect with ani
bad qualiti either of mind or heart the world would be astonish if
it knew how great a proport of it brightest ornamentsof those most
distinguish even in popular estim for wisdom and virtuear
complet sceptic in religion mani of them refrain from avow less
from person consider than from a conscienti though now in my
opinion a most mistaken apprehens lest by speak out what would
tend to weaken exist belief and by consequ as thei suppos
exist restraint thei should do harm instead of good
of unbeliev so call as well as of believ there ar mani
speci includ almost everi varieti of moral type but the best
among them as no on who ha had opportun of realli know them
will hesit to affirm ar more genuin religi in the best
sens of the word religion than those who exclus arrog to
themselv the titl the liber of the ag or in other word the
weaken of the obstin prejudic which make men unabl to see
what is befor their ey becaus it is contrari to their expect
ha caus it be veri commonli admit that a deist mai be truli
religi but if religion stand for ani grace of charact and not
for mere dogma the assert mai equal be made of mani whose belief
is far short of deism though thei mai think the proof incomplet that
the univers is a work of design and though thei assuredli disbeliev
that it can have an author and governor who is absolut in power as
well as perfect in good thei have that which constitut the
princip worth of all religion whatev an ideal concept of a
perfect be to which thei habitu refer as the guid of their
conscienc and thi ideal of good is usual far nearer to perfect
than the object deiti of those who think themselv oblig to find
absolut good in the author of a world so crowd with suffer
and so deform by injustic as our
my father moral convict wholli dissev from religion were
veri much of the charact of those of the greek philosoph and
were deliv with the forc and decis which character all
that came from him even at the veri earli ag at which i read with
him the memorabilia of xenophon i imbib from that work and from
hi comment a deep respect for the charact of socrat who stood
in my mind as a model of ideal excel and i well rememb how my
father at that time impress upon me the lesson of the choic of
hercul at a somewhat later period the lofti moral standard
exhibit in the write of plato oper upon me with great forc
my father moral inculc were at all time mainli those of the
socratici viri justic temper to which he gave a veri
extend applic verac persever readi to encount
pain and especi labour regard for the public good estim of
person accord to their merit and of thing accord to their
intrins us a life of exert in contradict to on of
selfindulg eas and sloth these and other moral he convei
in brief sentenc utter as occas aros of grave exhort
or stern reprob and contempt
but though direct moral teach doe much indirect doe more and
the effect my father produc on my charact did not depend sole
on what he said or did with that direct object but also and still
more on what manner of man he wa
in hi view of life he partook of the charact of the stoic the
epicurean and the cynic not in the modern but the ancient sens of
the word in hi person qualiti the stoic predomin hi
standard of moral wa epicurean inasmuch as it wa utilitarian
take as the exclus test of right and wrong the tendenc of
action to produc pleasur or pain but he had and thi wa the
cynic element scarc ani belief in pleasur at least in hi later
year of which alon on thi point i can speak confid he wa
not insens to pleasur but he deem veri few of them worth the
price which at least in the present state of societi must be paid
for them the greater number of miscarriag in life he consid to
be attribut to the overvalu of pleasur accordingli
temper in the larg sens intend by the greek philosoph
stop short at the point of moder in all indulgenceswa
with him as with them almost the central point of educ
precept hi inculc of thi virtu fill a larg place in my
childish remembr he thought human life a poor thing at best
after the fresh of youth and of unsatisfi curios had gone by
thi wa a topic on which he did not often speak especi it mai
be suppos in the presenc of young person but when he did it
wa with an air of settl and profound convict he would sometim
sai that if life were made what it might be by good govern and
good educ it would be worth have but he never spoke with
anyth like enthusiasm even of that possibl he never vari in
rate intellectu enjoy abov all other even in valu as
pleasur independ of their ulterior benefit the pleasur of
the benevol affect he place high in the scale and us to
sai that he had never known a happi old man except those who were
abl to live over again in the pleasur of the young for passion
emot of all sort and for everyth which ba been said or
written in exalt of them he profess the greatest contempt
he regard them as a form of mad the intens wa with him a
byeword of scorn disapprob he regard as an aberr of
the moral standard of modern time compar with that of the ancient
the great stress laid upon feel feel as such he consid
to be no proper subject of prais or blame right and wrong good and
bad he regard as qualiti sole of conductof act and omiss
there be no feel which mai not lead and doe not frequent lead
either to good or to bad action conscienc itself the veri desir to
act right often lead peopl to act wrong consist carri
out the doctrin that the object of prais and blame should be the
discourag of wrong conduct and the encourag of right he
refus to let hi prais or blame be influenc by the motiv of the
agent he blame as sever what he thought a bad action when the
motiv wa a feel of duti as if the agent had been conscious
evil doer he would not have accept as a plea in mitig for
inquisitor that thei sincer believ burn heret to be an
oblig of conscienc but though he did not allow honesti of purpos
to soften hi disapprob of action it had it full effect on hi
estim of charact no on prize conscienti and rectitud
of intent more highli or wa more incap of valu ani person
in whom he did not feel assur of it but he dislik peopl quit
as much for ani other defici provid he thought it equal like
to make them act ill he dislik for instanc a fanat in ani bad
caus as much as or more than on who adopt the same caus from
selfinterest becaus he thought him even more like to be practic
mischiev and thu hi avers to mani intellectu error or what
he regard as such partook in a certain sens of the charact of a
moral feel all thi is mere sai that he in a degre onc common
but now veri unusu threw hi feel into hi opinion which truli
it is difficult to understand how anyon who possess much of both can
fail to do none but those who do not care about opinion will confound
thi with intoler those who have opinion which thei hold to be
immens import and their contrari to be prodigi hurt
have ani deep regard for the gener good will necessarili dislik as
a class and in the abstract those who think wrong what thei think right
and right what thei think wrong though thei need not therefor be nor
wa my father insens to good qualiti in an oppon nor govern
in their estim of individu by on gener presumpt instead
of by the whole of their charact i grant that an earnest person
be no more infal than other men is liabl to dislik peopl
on account of opinion which do not merit dislik but if he neither
himself doe them ani ill offic nor conniv at it be donc by
other he is not intoler and the forbear which flow from a
conscienti sens of the import to mankind of the equal freedom
of all opinion is the onli toler which is commend or to the
highest moral order of mind possibl
it will be admit that a man of the opinion and the charact
abov describ wa like to leav a strong moral impress on ani
mind princip form by him and that hi moral teach wa not
like to err on the side of laxiti or indulg the element which
wa chiefli defici in hi moral relat to hi children wa that
of tender i do not believ that thi defici lai in hi own
natur i believ him to have had much more feel than he habitu
show and much greater capac of feel than were ever
develop he resembl most englishmen in be asham of the sign
of feel and by the absenc of demonstr starv the
feel themselv if we consid further that he wa in the try
posit of sole teacher and add to thi that hi temper wa
constitution irrit it is imposs not to feel true piti for
a father who did and strove to do so much for hi children who
would have so valu their affect yet who must have been
constantli feel that fear of him wa dry it up at it sourc
thi wa no longer the case later in life and with hi younger
children thei love him tenderli and if i cannot sai so much of
myself i wa alwai loyal devot to him as regard my own
educ i hesit to pronounc whether i wa more a loser or
gainer by hi sever it wa not such as to prevent me from have a
happi childhood and i do not believ that boi can be induc to
appli themselv with vigour andwhat is so much more
difficultpersever to dry and irksom studi by the sole forc
of persuas and soft word much must be done and much must be
learnt by children for which rigid disciplin and known liabil
to punish ar indispens as mean it is no doubt a veri
laudabl effort in modern teach to render as much as possibl of
what the young ar requir to learn easi and interest to them
but when thi principl is push to the length of not requir them
to learn anyth but what ha been made easi and interest on
of the chief object of educ is sacrif i rejoic in the
declin of the old brutal and tyrann system of teach which
howev did succe in enforc habit of applic but the new
as it seem to me is train up a race of men who will be incap
of do anyth which is disagre to them i do not then
believ that fear as an element in educ can be dispens with
but i am sure that it ought not to be the main element and when it
predomin so much as to preclud love and confid on the part of
the child to those who should be the unreservedli trust advis of
after year and perhap to seal up the fountain of frank and
spontan commun in the child natur it is an evil for
which a larg abat must be made from the benefit moral and
intellectu which mai flow from ani other part of the educ
dure thi first period of my life the habitu frequent of my
father hous were limit to a veri few person most of them littl
known to the world but whom person worth and more or less of
congeni with at least hi polit opinion not so frequent
to be met with then as sinc inclin him to cultiv and hi
convers with them i listen to with interest and instruct
my be an habitu inmat of my father studi made me acquaint
with the dearest of hi friend david ricardo who by hi benevol
counten and kindli of manner wa veri attract to young
person and who after i becam a student of polit economi
invit me to hi hous and to walk with him in order to convers on
the subject i wa a more frequent visitor from about 1817 or 1818
to mr hume who born in the same part of scotland as my father and
have been i rather think a younger schoolfellow or colleg
companion of hi had on return from india renew their youth

induc partli by that influenc to go into parliament and there
adopt the line of conduct which ha given him an honour place in
the histori of hi countri of mr bentham i saw much more ow to
the close intimaci which exist between him and my father i do not
know how soon after my father first arriv in england thei becam
acquaint but my father wa the earliest englishman of ani great
mark who thoroughli understood and in the main adopt bentham
gener view of ethic govern and law and thi wa a natur
foundat for sympathi between them and made them familiar
companion in a period of bentham life dure which he admit much
fewer visitor than wa the case subsequ at thi time mr
bentham pass some part of everi year at barrow green hous in a
beauti part of the surrei hill a few mile from godston and
there i each summer accompani my father in a long visit in 1813 mr
bentham my father and i made an excurs which includ oxford
bath and bristol exet plymouth and portsmouth in thi journei i
saw mani thing which were instruct to me and acquir my first
tast for natur sceneri in the elementari form of fond for a
view in the succeed winter we move into a hous veri near mr
bentham which my father rent from him in queen squar
westminst from 1814 to 1817 mr bentham live dure half of each
year at ford abbei in somersetshir or rather in a part of
devonshir surround by somersetshir which interv i had the
advantag of pass at that place thi sojourn wa i think an
import circumst in my educ noth contribut more to
nourish elev of sentiment in a peopl than the larg and free
charact of their habit the middleag architectur the
baroni hall and the spaciou and lofti room of thi fine old
place so unlik the mean and cramp extern of english
middleclass life gave the sentiment of a larger and freer exist
and were to me a sort of poetic cultiv aid also by the
charact of the ground in which the abbei stood which were riant
and seclud umbrag and full of the sound of fall water
i ow anoth of the fortun circumst in my educ a
year resid in franc to mr bentham brother gener sir
samuel bentham i had seen sir samuel bentham and hi famili at their
hous near gosport in the cours of the tour alreadi mention he
be then superintend of the dockyard at portsmouth and dure a
stai of a few dai which thei made at ford abbei shortli after the
peac befor go to live on the contin in 1820 thei invit me
for a six month visit to them in the south of franc which their
kind ultim prolong to nearli a twelvemonth sir samuel
bentham though of a charact of mind differ from that of hi
illustri brother wa a man of veri consider attain and
gener power with a decid geniu for mechan art hi wife a
daughter of the celebr chemist dr fordyc wa a woman of strong
will and decid charact much gener knowledg and great
practic good sens of the edgeworth kind she wa the rule spirit
of the household as she deserv and wa well qualifi to be
their famili consist of on son the emin botanist and three
daughter the youngest about two year my senior i am indebt to
them for much and variou instruct and for an almost parent
interest in my welfar when i first join them in mai 1820 thei
occupi the chteau of pompignan still belong to a descend of
voltair enemi on the height overlook the plain of the garonn
between montauban and toulous i accompani them in an excurs to
the pyrene includ a stai of some durat at bagnr de
bigorr a journei to pau bayonn and bagnr de luchon and an
ascent of the pic du midi de bigorr
thi first introduct to the highest order of mountain sceneri made
the deepest impress on me and gave a colour to my tast through
life in octob we proceed by the beauti mountain rout of
castr and st pon from toulous to montpelli in which last
neighbourhood sir samuel had just bought the estat of restinclir
near the foot of the singular mountain of st loup dure thi
resid in franc i acquir a familiar knowledg of the french
languag and acquaint with the ordinari french literatur i took
lesson in variou bodili exercis in none of which howev i made
ani profici and at montpelli i attend the excel winter
cours of lectur at the facult de scienc those of m anglada
on chemistri of m proven on zoologi and of a veri accomplish
repres of the eighteenth centuri metaphys m gergonn on
logic under the name of philosophi of the scienc i also went
through a cours of the higher mathemat under the privat tuition
of m lenthric a professor at the lyce of montpelli but the
greatest perhap of the mani advantag which i ow to thi episod
in my educ wa that of have breath for a whole year the
free and genial atmospher of continent life thi advantag wa not
the less real though i could not then estim nor even conscious
feel it have so littl experi of english life and the few
peopl i knew be mostli such as had public object of a larg and
person disinterest kind at heart i wa ignor of the low
moral tone of what in england is call societi the habit of not
inde profess but take for grant in everi mode of
implic that conduct is of cours alwai direct toward low and
petti object the absenc of high feel which manifest itself by
sneer depreci of all demonstr of them and by gener
abstin except among a few of the stricter religionist from
profess ani high principl of action at all except in those
preordain case in which such profess is put on as part of the
costum and formal of the occas i could not then know or
estim the differ between thi manner of exist and that of
a peopl like the french whose fault if equal real ar at all
event differ among whom sentiment which by comparison at least
mai be call elev ar the current coin of human intercours
both in book and in privat life and though often evapor in
profess ar yet kept aliv in the nation at larg by constant
exercis and stimul by sympathi so as to form a live and
activ part of the exist of great number of person and to be
recognis and understood by all neither could i then appreci the
gener cultur of the understand which result from the habitu
exercis of the feel and is thu carri down into the most
uneduc class of sever countri on the contin in a degre
not equal in england among the socal educ except where an
unusu tender of conscienc lead to a habitu exercis of the
intellect on question of right and wrong i did not know the wai in
which among the ordinari english the absenc of interest in thing
of an unselfish kind except occasion in a special thing here and
there and the habit of not speak to other nor much even to
themselv about the thing in which thei do feel interest caus
both their feel and their intellectu faculti to remain
undevelop or to develop themselv onli in some singl and veri
limit direct reduc them consid as spiritu be to
a kind of neg exist all these thing i did not perceiv till
long afterward but i even then felt though without state it
clearli to myself the contrast between the frank sociabl and
amiabl of french person intercours and the english mode of
exist in which everybodi act as if everybodi els with few or
no except wa either an enemi or a bore in franc it is true
the bad as well as the good point both of individu and of nation
charact come more to the surfac and break out more fearlessli in
ordinari intercours than in england but the gener habit of the
peopl is to show as well as to expect friendli feel in everi on
toward everi other wherev there is not some posit caus for the
opposit in england it is onli of the best bred peopl in the upper
or upper middl rank that anyth like thi can be said
in my wai through pari both go and return i pass some time
in the hous of m sai the emin polit economist who wa a
friend and correspond of my father have becom acquaint with
him on a visit to england a year or two after the peac he wa a man
of the later period of the french revolut a fine specimen of the
best kind of french republican on of those who had never bent the
knee to bonapart though court by him to do so a truli upright
brave and enlighten man he live a quiet and studiou life made
happi by warm affect public and privat he wa acquaint with
mani of the chief of the liber parti and i saw variou noteworthi
person while stai at thi hous among whom i have pleasur in the
recollect of have onc seen saintsimon not yet the founder
either of a philosophi or a religion and consid onli as a clever
origin the chief fruit which i carri awai from the societi i saw
wa a strong and perman interest in continent liber of
which i ever afterward kept myself au courant as much as of
english polit a thing not at all usual in those dai with
englishmen and which had a veri salutari influenc on my develop
keep me free from the error alwai preval in englandand from
which even my father with all hi superior to prejudic wa not
exemptof judg univers question by a mere english standard
after pass a few week at caen with an old friend of my father
i return to england in juli 1821 and my educ resum it
ordinari cours
chapter iii
last stage of educ and first of selfeduc
for the first year or two after my visit to franc i continu my old
studi with the addit of some new on when i return my
father wa just finish for the press hi element of polit
economi and he made me perform an exercis on the manuscript which
mr bentham practis on all hi own write make what he call
margin content a short abstract of everi paragraph to enabl
the writer more easili to judg of and improv the order of the
idea and the gener charact of the exposit soon after my
father put into my hand condillac trait de sensat and the
logic and metaphys volum of hi cour detud the first
notwithstand the superfici resembl between condillac
psycholog system and my father quit as much for a warn as
for an exampl i am not sure whether it wa in thi winter or the
next that i first read a histori of the french revolut i learnt
with astonish that the principl of democraci then appar in
so insignific and hopeless a minor everywher in europ had
born all befor them in franc thirti year earlier and had been the
creed of the nation as mai be suppos from thi i had previous a
veri vagu idea of that great commot i knew onli that the french
had thrown off the absolut monarchi of loui xiv and xv had put
the king and queen to death guillotin mani person on of whom wa
lavoisi and had ultim fallen under the despot of bonapart
from thi time as wa natur the subject took an immens hold of my
feel it alli itself with all my juvenil aspir to the
charact of a democrat champion what had happen so late
seem as if it might easili happen again and the most transcend
glori i wa capabl of conceiv wa that of figur success or
unsuccess as a girondist in an english convent
dure the winter of 18212 mr john austin with whom at the time of
my visit to franc my father had but late becom acquaint kindli
allow me to read roman law with him my father notwithstand hi
abhorr of the chao of barbar call english law had turn
hi thought toward the bar as on the whole less inelig for me
than ani other profess and these read with mr austin who had
made bentham best idea hi own and ad much to them from other
sourc and from hi own mind were not onli a valuabl introduct
to legal studi but an import portion of gener educ with
mr austin i read heinecciu on the institut hi roman antiqu
and part of hi exposit of the pandect to which wa ad a
consider portion of blackston it wa at the commenc of these
studi that my father as a need accompani to them put into my
hand bentham princip specul as interpret to the contin
and inde to all the world by dumont in the trait de lgislat
the read of thi book wa an epoch in my life on of the turn
point in my mental histori
my previou educ had been in a certain sens alreadi a cours
of bentham the bentham standard of the greatest happi wa
that which i had alwai been taught to appli i wa even familiar
with an abstract discuss of it form an episod in an
unpublish dialogu on govern written by my father on the
platon model yet in the first page of bentham it burst upon me
with all the forc of novelti what thu impress me wa the chapter
in which bentham pass judgment on the common mode of reason in
moral and legisl deduc from phrase like law of natur
right reason the moral sens natur rectitud and the like
and character them as dogmat in disguis impos it
sentiment upon other under cover of sound express which
convei no reason for the sentiment but set up the sentiment as it
own reason it had not struck me befor that bentham principl put
an end to all thi the feel rush upon me that all previou
moralist were supersed and that here inde wa the commenc
of a new era in thought thi impress wa strengthen by the
manner in which bentham put into scientif form the applic of
the happi principl to the moral of action by analys the
variou class and order of their consequ but what struck me
at that time most of all wa the classif of offenc which is
much more clear compact and impos in dumont rdaction than in
the origin work of bentham from which it wa taken logic and the
dialect of plato which had form so larg a part of my previou
train had given me a strong relish for accur classif
thi tast had been strengthen and enlighten by the studi of
botani on the principl of what is call the natur method which
i had taken up with great zeal though onli as an amus dure my
stai in franc and when i found scientif classif appli to
the great and complex subject of punish act under the guidanc
of the ethic principl of pleasur and pain consequ
follow out in the method of detail introduc into these subject by
bentham i felt taken up to an emin from which i could survei a
vast mental domain and see stretch out into the distanc
intellectu result beyond all comput as i proceed further
there seem to be ad to thi intellectu clear the most
inspir prospect of practic improv in human affair to
bentham gener view of the construct of a bodi of law i wa not
altogeth a stranger have read with attent that admir
compendium my father articl on jurisprud but i had read it
with littl profit and scarc ani interest no doubt from it
extrem gener and abstract charact and also becaus it
concern the form more than the substanc of the corpu juri the
logic rather than the ethic of law but bentham subject wa
legisl of which jurisprud is onli the formal part and at
everi page he seem to open a clearer and broader concept of what
human opinion and institut ought to be how thei might be made
what thei ought to be and how far remov from it thei now ar when
i laid down the last volum of the trait i had becom a differ
be the principl of util understood as bentham understood
it and appli in the manner in which he appli it through these
three volum fell exactli into it place as the keyston which held
togeth the detach and fragmentari compon part of my knowledg
and belief it gave uniti to my concept of thing i now had
opinion a creed a doctrin a philosophi in on among the best
sens of the word a religion the inculc and diffus of which
could be made the princip outward purpos of a life and i had a
grand concept laid befor me of chang to be effect in the
condit of mankind through that doctrin the trait de legisl
wound up with what wa to me a most impress pictur of human life as
it would be made by such opinion and such law as were recommend in
the treatis the anticip of practic improv were
studious moder deprec and discountenanc as reveri of
vagu enthusiasm mani thing which will on dai seem so natur to human
be that injustic will probabl be done to those who onc thought
them chimer but in my state of mind thi appear of superior
to illus ad to the effect which bentham doctrin produc on me
by heighten the impress of mental power and the vista of improv
which he did open wa suffici larg and brilliant to light up my life
as well as to give a definit shape to my aspir
after thi i read from time to time the most import of the other
work of bentham which had then seen the light either as written by
himself or as edit by dumont thi wa my privat read while
under my father direct my studi were carri into the higher
branch of analyt psycholog i now read lock essai and wrote
out an account of it consist of a complet abstract of everi
chapter with such remark as occur to me which wa read by or
i think to my father and discuss throughout i perform the same
process with helvetiu de lesprit which i read of my own choic
thi prepar of abstract subject to my father censorship wa
of great servic to me by compel precis in conceiv and
express psycholog doctrin whether accept as truth or onli
regard as the opinion of other after helvetiu my father made me
studi what he deem the realli masterproduct in the philosophi
of mind hartlei observ on man thi book though it did
not like the trait de lgislat give a new colour to my
exist made a veri similar impress on me in regard to it
immedi subject hartlei explan incomplet as in mani point
it is of the more complex mental phenomena by the law of associ
commend itself to me at onc as a real analysi and made me feel by
contrast the insuffici of the mere verbal gener of
condillac and even of the instruct grope and feel about for
psycholog explan of lock it wa at thi veri time that my
father commenc write hi analysi of the mind which carri
hartlei mode of explain the mental phenomena to so much greater
length and depth he could onli command the concentr of thought
necessari for thi work dure the complet leisur of hi holidai
for a month or six week annual and he commenc it in the summer
of 1822 in the first holidai he pass at dork in which
neighbourhood from that time to the end of hi life with the
except of two year he live as far as hi offici duti
permit for six month of everi year he work at the analysi
dure sever success vacat up to the year 1829 when it wa
publish and allow me to read the manuscript portion by portion
as it advanc the other princip english writer on mental
philosophi i read as i felt inclin particularli berkelei hume
essai reid dugald stewart and brown on caus and effect brown
lectur i did not read until two or three year later nor at that
time had my father himself read them
among the work read in the cours of thi year which contribut
materi to my develop i ow it to mention a book written on
the foundat of some of bentham manuscript and publish under
the pseudonym of philip beauchamp entitl analysi of the influenc
of natur religion on the tempor happi of mankind thi wa an
examin not of the truth but of the us of religi belief
in the most gener sens apart from the peculiar of ani special
revel which of all the part of the discuss concern
religion is the most import in thi ag in which real belief in
ani religi doctrin is feebl and precari but the opinion of
it necess for moral and social purpos almost univers and when
those who reject revel veri gener take refug in an
optimist deism a worship of the order of natur and the suppos
cours of provid at least as full of contradict and
pervert to the moral sentiment as ani of the form of
christian if onli it is as complet realiz yet veri littl
with ani claim to a philosoph charact ha been written by
sceptic against the us of thi form of belief the volum
bear the name of philip beauchamp had thi for it special object
have been shown to my father in manuscript it wa put into my hand
by him and i made a margin analysi of it as i had done of the
element of polit economi next to the trait de lgislat
it wa on of the book which by the search charact of it
analysi produc the greatest effect upon me on read it late
after an interv of mani year i find it to have some of the defect
as well as the merit of the bentham mode of thought and to
contain as i now think mani weak argument but with a great
overbal of sound on and much good materi for a more
complet philosoph and conclus treatment of the subject
i have now i believ mention all the book which had ani
consider effect on my earli mental develop from thi point
i began to carri on my intellectu cultiv by write still more
than by read in the summer of 1822 i wrote my first argument
essai i rememb veri littl about it except that it wa an attack
on what i regard as the aristocrat prejudic that the rich were
or were like to be superior in moral qualiti to the poor my
perform wa entir argument without ani of the declam
which the subject would admit of and might be expect to suggest to
a young writer in that depart howev i wa and remain veri
inapt dry argument wa the onli thing i could manag or willingli
attempt though passiv i wa veri suscept to the effect of
all composit whether in the form of poetri or oratori which
appeal to the feel on ani basi of reason my father who knew
noth of thi essai until it wa finish wa well satisfi and
as i learnt from other even pleas with it but perhap from a
desir to promot the exercis of other mental faculti than the
pure logic he advis me to make my next exercis in composit
on of the orator kind on which suggest avail myself of
my familiar with greek histori and idea and with the athenian
orat i wrote two speech on an accus the other a defenc
of pericl on a suppos impeach for not march out to fight
the lacedemonian on their invas of attica after thi i continu
to write paper on subject often veri much beyond my capac but
with great benefit both from the exercis itself and from the
discuss which it led to with my father
i had now also begun to convers on gener subject with the
instruct men with whom i came in contact and the opportun of
such contact natur becam more numer the two friend of my
father from whom i deriv most and with whom i most associ were
mr grote and mr john austin the acquaint of both with my father
wa recent but had ripen rapidli into intimaci mr grote wa
introduc to my father by mr ricardo i think in 1819 be then
about twentyf year old and sought assidu hi societi and
convers alreadi a highli instruct man he wa yet by the side
of my father a tyro in the great subject of human opinion but he
rapidli seiz on my father best idea and in the depart of
polit opinion he made himself known as earli as 1820 by a
pamphlet in defenc of radic reform in repli to a celebr
articl by sir jame mackintosh then late publish in he
edinburgh review mr grote father the banker wa i believ
a thorough tori and hi mother intens evangel so that for
hi liber opinion he wa in no wai indebt to home influenc
but unlik most person who have the prospect of be rich by
inherit he had though activ engag in the busi of
bank devot a great portion of time to philosoph studi and
hi intimaci with my father did much to decid the charact of the
next stage in hi mental progress him i often visit and my
convers with him on polit moral and philosoph subject
gave me in addit to much valuabl instruct all the pleasur
and benefit of sympathet communion with a man of the high
intellectu and moral emin which hi life and write have sinc
manifest to the world
mr austin who wa four or five year older than mr grote wa the
eldest son of a retir miller in suffolk who had made monei by
contract dure the war and who must have been a man of remark
qualiti as i infer from the fact that all hi son were of more
than common abil and all emin gentlemen the on with whom we
ar now concern and whose write on jurisprud have made him
celebr wa for some time in the armi and serv in sicili under
lord william bentinck after the peac he sold hi commiss and
studi for the bar to which he had been call for some time befor
my father knew him he wa not like mr grote to ani extent a pupil
of my father but he had attain by read and thought a
consider number of the same opinion modifi by hi own veri
decid individu of charact he wa a man of great intellectu
power which in convers appear at their veri best from the
vigour and rich of express with which under the excit of
discuss he wa accustom to maintain some view or other of most
gener subject and from an appear of not onli strong but
deliber and collect will mix with a certain bitter partli
deriv from tempera and partli from the gener cast of hi
feel and reflect the dissatisfact with life and the world
felt more or less in the present state of societi and intellect by
everi discern and highli conscienti mind gave in hi case a
rather melancholi ting to the charact veri natur to those whose
passiv moral suscept ar more than proport to their
activ energi for it must be said that the strength of will of
which hi manner seem to give such strong assur expend itself
princip in manner with great zeal for human improv a strong
sens of duti and capac and acquir the extent of which is
prove by the write he ha left he hardli ever complet ani
intellectu task of magnitud he had so high a standard of what
ought to be done so exagger a sens of defici in hi own
perform and wa so unabl to content himself with the amount of
elabor suffici for the occas and the purpos that he not
onli spoilt much of hi work for ordinari us by overlabour it but
spent so much time and exert in superflu studi and thought that
when hi task ought to have been complet he had gener work
himself into an ill without have half finish what he
undertook from thi mental infirm of which he is not the sole
exampl among the accomplish and abl men whom i have known
combin with liabil to frequent attack of disabl though not
danger illhealth he accomplish through life littl in
comparison with what he seem capabl of but what he did produc is
held in the veri highest estim by the most compet judg and
like coleridg he might plead as a setoff that he had been to mani
person through hi convers a sourc not onli of much
instruct but of great elev of charact on me hi influenc
wa most salutari it wa moral in the best sens he took a sincer
and kind interest in me far beyond what could have been expect
toward a mere youth from a man of hi ag stand and what seem
auster of charact there wa in hi convers and demeanour a
tone of highminded which did not show itself so much if the
qualiti exist as much in ani of the other person with whom at that
time i associ my intercours with him wa the more benefici
ow to hi be of a differ mental type from all other
intellectu men whom i frequent and he from the first set himself
decidedli against the prejudic and narrow which ar almost
sure to be found in a young man form by a particular mode of thought
or a particular social circl
hi younger brother charl austin of whom at thi time and for the
next year or two i saw much had also a great effect on me though of
a veri differ descript he wa but a few year older than
myself and had then just left the univers where he had shone with
great clat as a man of intellect and a brilliant orat and
convers the effect he produc on hi cambridg contemporari
deserv to be account an histor event for to it mai in part be
trace the tendenc toward liber in gener and the bentham
and politicoeconom form of it in particular which show itself in
a portion of the more activemind young men of the higher class
from thi time to 1830 the union debat societi at that time at
the height of it reput wa an arena where what were then
thought extrem opinion in polit and philosophi were weekli
assert face to face with their opposit befor audienc
consist of the lite of the cambridg youth and though mani
person afterward of more or less note of whom lord macaulai is the
most celebr gain their first orator laurel in those
debat the realli influenti mind among these intellectu
gladiat wa charl austin he continu after leav the
univers to be by hi convers and person ascend a
leader among the same class of young men who had been hi associ
there and he attach me among other to hi car through him i
becam acquaint with macaulai hyde and charl villier strutt
now lord belper romilli now lord romilli and master of the roll
and variou other who subsequ figur in literatur or polit
and among whom i heard discuss on mani topic as yet to a certain
degre new to me the influenc of charl austin over me differ
from that of the person i have hitherto mention in be not the
influenc of a man over a boi but that of an elder contemporari it
wa through him that i first felt myself not a pupil under teacher
but a man among men he wa the first person of intellect whom i met
on a ground of equal though as yet much hi inferior on that
common ground he wa a man who never fail to impress greatli those
with whom he came in contact even when their opinion were the veri
revers of hi the impress he gave wa that of boundless strength
togeth with talent which combin with such appar forc of will
and charact seem capabl of domin the world those who knew
him whether friendli to him or not alwai anticip that he would
plai a conspicu part in public life it is seldom that men produc
so great an immedi effect by speech unless thei in some degre
lai themselv out for it and he did thi in no ordinari degre he
love to strike and even to startl he knew that decis is the
greatest element of effect and he utter hi opinion with all the
decis he could throw into them never so well pleas as when he
astonish anyon by their audac veri unlik hi brother who made
war against the narrow interpret and applic of the
principl thei both profess he on the contrari present the
bentham doctrin in the most startl form of which thei were
suscept exagger everyth in them which tend to
consequ offens to anyon preconceiv feel all which
he defend with such verv and vivac and carri off by a manner
so agreeabl as well as forcibl that he alwai either came off
victor or divid the honour of the field it is my belief that much
of the notion popularli entertain of the tenet and sentiment of
what ar call benthamit or utilitarian had it origin in paradox
thrown out by charl austin it must be said howev that hi exampl
wa follow haud passibu aequi by younger proselyt and that to
outrer whatev wa by anybodi consid offens in the doctrin
and maxim of bentham becam at on time the badg of a small coteri
of youth all of these who had anyth in them myself among other
quickli outgrew thi boyish vaniti and those who had not becam tire
of differ from other peopl and gave up both the good and the bad part
of the heterodox opinion thei had for some time profess
it wa in the winter of 18223 that i form the plan of a littl
societi to be compos of young men agre in fundament
principlesacknowledg util as their standard in ethic and
polit and a certain number of the princip corollari drawn from
it in the philosophi i had acceptedand meet onc a fortnight to
read essai and discuss question conform to the premis thu
agre on the fact would hardli be worth mention but for the
circumst that the name i gave to the societi i had plan wa the
utilitarian societi it wa the first time that anyon had taken the
titl of utilitarian and the term made it wai into the languag from
thi humbl sourc i did not invent the word but found it in on of
galt novel the annal of the parish in which the scotch
clergyman of whom the book is a suppos autobiographi is repres
as warn hi parishion not to leav the gospel and becom
utilitarian with a boi fond for a name and a banner i seiz
on the word and for some year call myself and other by it as a
sectarian appel and it came to be occasion us by some
other hold the opinion which it wa intend to design as those
opinion attract more notic the term wa repeat by stranger and
oppon and got into rather common us just about the time when those
who had origin assum it laid down that along with other sectarian
characterist the societi so call consist at first of no more
than three member on of whom be mr bentham amanuensi
obtain for us permiss to hold our meet in hi hous the number
never i think reach ten and the societi wa broken up in 1826 it
had thu an exist of about three year and a half the chief effect
of it as regard myself over and abov the benefit of practic in oral
discuss wa that of bring me in contact with sever young men at

the occup of so much of my time by offic work did not relax my
attent to my own pursuit which were never carri on more

the first write of mine which got into print were two letter
publish toward the end of 1822 in the travel even newspap

becom on of the most import newspap organ of liber polit
colonel torren himself wrote much of the polit economi of hi
paper and had at thi time made an attack upon some opinion of ricardo

answer and coulson out of consider for my father and goodwil to
me insert it there wa a repli by torren to which i again
rejoin i soon after attempt someth consider more ambiti

to be now and the holder of obnoxi opinion had to be alwai readi
to argu and reargu for the liberti of express them i wrote a
seri of five letter under the signatur of wickliff go over the
whole length and breadth of the question of free public of all
opinion on religion and offer them to the morn chronicl three
of them were publish in januari and februari 1823 the other two

thought with great facil and skill from thi time the chronicl
ceas to be the mere whig organ it wa befor and dure the next
ten year becam to a consider extent a vehicl of the opinion of
the utilitarian radic thi wa mainli by what black himself wrote
with some assist from fonblanqu who first show hi emin
qualiti as a writer by articl and jeux desprit in the
chronicl the defect of the law and of the administr of
justic were the subject on which that paper render most servic to
improv up to that time hardli a word had been said except by
bentham and my father against that most peccant part of english
institut and of their administr it wa the almost univers
creed of englishmen that the law of england the judicatur of england
the unpaid magistraci of england were model of excel i do not go
beyond the mark in sai that after bentham who suppli the
princip materi the greatest share of the merit of break down
thi wretch superstit belong to black as editor of the morn

absurd and vice of the law and the court of justic paid and
unpaid until he forc some sens of them into peopl mind on mani
other question he becam the organ of opinion much in advanc of ani
which had ever befor found regular advocaci in the newspap press
black wa a frequent visitor of my father and mr grote us to sai
that he alwai knew by the mondai morn articl whether black had
been with my father on the sundai black wa on of the most influenti
of the mani channel through which my father convers and person
influenc made hi opinion tell on the world cooper with the
effect of hi write in make him a power in the countri such as it
ha rare been the lot of an individu in a privat station to be
through the mere forc of intellect and charact and a power which wa
often act the most effici where it wa least seen and suspect
i have alreadi notic how much of what wa done by ricardo hume and
grote wa the result in part of hi prompt and persuas he wa
the good geniu by the side of brougham in most of what he did for the
public either on educ law reform or ani other subject and hi
influenc flow in minor stream too numer to be specifi thi
influenc wa now about to receiv a great extens by the foundat
of the westminst review
contrari to what mai have been suppos my father wa in no degre a
parti to set up the westminst review the need of a radic
organ to make head against the edinburgh and quarterli then in the
period of their greatest reput and influenc had been a topic of
convers between him and mr bentham mani year earlier and it had
been a part of their chteau en espagn that my father should be the
editor but the idea had never assum ani practic shape in 1823
howev mr bentham determin to establish the review at hi own
cost and offer the editorship to my father who declin it as
incompat with hi india hous appoint it wa then entrust to
mr now sir john bowr at that time a merchant in the citi mr
bowr had been for two or three year previou an assidu frequent
of mr bentham to whom he wa recommend by mani person good
qualiti by an ardent admir for bentham a zealou adopt of
mani though not all of hi opinion and not least by an extens
acquaintanceship and correspond with liber of all countri
which seem to qualifi him for be a power agent in spread
bentham fame and doctrin through all quarter of the world my
father had seen littl of bowr but knew enough of him to have form
a strong opinion that he wa a man of an entir differ type from
what my father consid suitabl for conduct a polit and
philosoph review and he augur so ill of the enterpris that he
regret it altogeth feel persuad not onli that mr bentham
would lose hi monei but that discredit would probabl be brought upon
radic principl he could not howev desert mr bentham and he
consent to write an articl for the first number as it had been a
favourit portion of the scheme formerli talk of that part of the
work should be devot to review the other review thi articl of
my father wa to be a gener critic of the edinburgh review from
it commenc befor write it he made me read through all the
volum of the review or as much of each as seem of ani import
which wa not so arduou a task in 1823 as it would be now and make
note for him of the articl which i thought he would wish to examin
either on account of their good or their bad qualiti thi paper of my
father wa the chief caus of the sensat which the westminst
review produc at it first appear and is both in concept and
in execut on of the most strike of all hi write he began by
an analysi of the tendenc of period literatur in gener
point out that it cannot like book wait for success but must
succe immedi or not at all and is henc almost certain to
profess and inculc the opinion alreadi held by the public to which
it address itself instead of attempt to rectifi or improv those
opinion he next to character the posit of the edinburgh
review as a polit organ enter into a complet analysi from the
radic point of view of the british constitut he held up to notic
it thoroughli aristocrat charact the nomin of a major of
the hous of common by a few hundr famili the entir

wa induc for conveni to admit to a share of power and final
what he call it two prop the church and the legal profess he
point out the natur tendenc of an aristocrat bodi of thi
composit to group itself into two parti on of them in possess
of the execut the other endeavour to supplant the former and
becom the predomin section by the aid of public opinion without ani
essenti sacrific of the aristocrat predomin he describ the
cours like to be pursu and the polit ground occupi by an
aristocrat parti in opposit coquet with popular principl for
the sake of popular support he show how thi idea wa realiz in the
conduct of the whig parti and of the edinburgh review as it chief
literari organ he describ as their main characterist what he
term seesaw write altern on both side of the question which
touch the power or interest of the govern class sometim in

and illustr hi posit by copiou specimen so formid an
attack on the whig parti and polici had never befor been made nor had
so great a blow ever been struck in thi countri for radic nor
wa there i believ ani live person capabl of write that articl
except my father2
in the meantim the nascent review had form a junction with anoth
project of a pure literari period to be edit by mr henri
southern afterward a diplomatist then a literari man by profess
the two editor agre to unit their corp and divid the editorship
bowr take the polit southern the literari depart
southern review wa to have been publish by longman and that firm
though part proprietor of the edinburgh were will to be the

made and the prospectus sent out the longman saw my father attack
on the edinburgh and drew back my father wa now appeal to for hi
interest with hi own publish baldwin which wa exert with a
success result and so in april 1824 amidst anyth but hope on my
father part and that of most of those who afterward aid in
carri on the review the first number made it appear
that number wa an agreeabl surpris to most of us the averag of the
articl wa of much better qualiti than had been expect the literari

frequent of bentham wa a friend of both the austin and had adopt
with great ardour mr bentham philosoph opinion partli from
accid there were in the first number as mani as five articl by
bingham and we were extrem pleas with them i well rememb the
mix feel i myself had about the review the joi of find what
we did not at all expect that it wa suffici good to be capabl of
be made a credit organ of those who held the opinion it
profess and extrem vexat sinc it wa so good on the whole at
what we thought the blemish of it when howev in addit to our
gener favour opinion of it we learn that it had an
extraordinari larg sale for a first number and found that the
appear of a radic review with pretens equal to those of the
establish organ of parti had excit much attent there could
be no room for hesit and we all becam eager in do everyth
we could to strengthen and improv it

our youth zeal render us by no mean backward in make complaint
we led the two editor a sad life from my knowledg of what i then wa
i have no doubt that we were at least as often wrong as right and i am
veri certain that if the review had been carri on accord to our
notion i mean those of the junior it would have been no better
perhap not even so good as it wa but it is worth note as a fact in
the histori of bentham that the period organ by which it wa
best known wa from the first extrem unsatisfactori to those whose
opinion on all subject it wa suppos special to repres

afterward sought my father acquaint and frequent hi hous
among these mai be mention strutt afterward lord belper and the

by no mean complet unanim among ani portion of us nor had ani of

hi essai on govern wa regard probabl by all of us as a
masterpiec of polit wisdom our adhes by no mean extend to
the paragraph of it in which he maintain that women mai consist
with good govern be exclud from the suffrag becaus their
interest is the same with that of men from thi doctrin i and all
those who form my chosen associ most posit dissent it is
due to my father to sai that he deni have intend to affirm that
women should be exclud ani more than men under the ag of forti
concern whom he maintain in the veri next paragraph an exactli
similar thesi he wa as he truli said not discuss whether the
suffrag had better be restrict but onli assum that it is to be
restrict what is the utmost limit of restrict which doe not
necessarili involv a sacrific of the secur for good govern
but i thought then as i have alwai thought sinc that the opinion
which he acknowledg no less than that which he disclaim is as
great an error as ani of those against which the essai wa direct
that the interest of women is includ in that of men exactli as much as
the interest of subject is includ in that of king and no more and
that everi reason which exist for give the suffrag to anybodi
demand that it should not be withheld from women thi wa also the
gener opinion of the younger proselyt and it is pleasant to be abl
to sai that mr bentham on thi import point wa wholli on our side
but though none of us probabl agre in everi respect with my father
hi opinion as i said befor were the princip element which gave
it colour and charact to the littl group of young men who were the
first propag of what wa afterward call philosoph radic
their mode of think wa not character by bentham in ani sens
which ha relat to bentham as a chief or guid but rather by a
combin of bentham point of view with that of the modern polit

if all would be gain if the whole popul were taught to read if
all sort of opinion were allow to be address to them by word and
in write and if by mean of the suffrag thei could nomin a
legislatur to give effect to the opinion thei adopt he thought that
when the legislatur no longer repres a class interest it would

these variou opinion were seiz on with youth fanatic by the
littl knot of young men of whom i wa on and we put into them a
sectarian spirit from which in intent at least my father wa
wholli free what we or rather a phantom substitut in the place of
us were sometim by a ridicul exagger call by other
name a school some of us for a time realli hope and aspir to be
the french philosoph of the eighteenth centuri were the exampl we
sought to imit and we hope to accomplish no less result no on of
the set went to so great excess in hi boyish ambit as i did which
might be shown by mani particular were it not an useless wast of
space and time
all thi howev is properli onli the outsid of our exist or at
least the intellectu part alon and no more than on side of that
in attempt to penetr inward and give ani indic of what we
were as human be i must be understood as speak onli of myself
of whom alon i can speak from suffici knowledg and i do not
believ that the pictur would suit ani of my companion without mani
and great modif
i conceiv that the descript so often given of a benthamit as a
mere reason machin though extrem inapplic to most of those
who have been design by that titl wa dure two or three year of
my life not altogeth untru of me it wa perhap as applic to me
as it can well be to anyon just enter into life to whom the common
object of desir must in gener have at least the attract of
novelti there is noth veri extraordinari in thi fact no youth of
the ag i then wa can be expect to be more than on thing and thi
wa the thing i happen to be ambit and desir of distinct i had
in abund and zeal for what i thought the good of mankind wa my
strongest sentiment mix with and colour all other but my zeal
wa as yet littl els at that period of my life than zeal for
specul opinion it had not it root in genuin benevol or
sympathi with mankind though these qualiti held their due place in
my ethic standard nor wa it connect with ani high enthusiasm for
ideal nobl yet of thi feel i wa imagin veri
suscept but there wa at that time an intermiss of it natur
aliment poetic cultur while there wa a superabund of the
disciplin antagonist to it that of mere logic and analysi add to
thi that as alreadi mention my father teach tend to the
undervalu of feel it wa not that he wa himself coldheart or
insens i believ it wa rather from the contrari qualiti he
thought that feel could take care of itself that there wa sure to
be enough of it if action were properli care about offend by the
frequenc with which in ethic and philosoph controversi feel
is made the ultim reason and justif of conduct instead of
be itself call on for a justif while in practic action
the effect of which on human happi is mischiev ar defend as
be requir by feel and the charact of a person of feel
obtain a credit for desert which he thought onli due to action he
had a real impati of attribut prais to feel or of ani but
the most spare refer to it either in the estim of person or
in the discuss of thing in addit to the influenc which thi
characterist in him had on me and other we found all the opinion to
which we attach most import constantli attack on the ground of
feel util wa denounc as cold calcul polit economi as
hardheart antipopul doctrin as repuls to the natur
feel of mankind we retort by the word sentiment which
along with declam and vagu gener serv us as common
term of opprobrium although we were gener in the right as against
those who were oppos to us the effect wa that the cultiv of
feel except the feel of public and privat duti wa not in much
esteem among us and had veri littl place in the thought of most of
us myself in particular what we princip thought of wa to alter
peopl opinion to make them believ accord to evid and know
what wa their real interest which when thei onc knew thei would we
thought by the instrument of opinion enforc a regard to it upon on
anoth while fulli recognis the superior excel of unselfish
benevol and love of justic we did not expect the regener of
mankind from ani direct action on those sentiment but from the effect
of educ intellect enlighten the selfish feel although thi
last is prodigi import as a mean of improv in the hand of
those who ar themselv impel by nobler principl of action i do
not believ that ani on of the survivor of the benthamit or
utilitarian of that dai now reli mainli upon it for the gener
amend of human conduct
from thi neglect both in theori and in practic of the cultiv of
feel natur result among other thing an undervalu of
poetri and of imagin gener as an element of human natur it
is or wa part of the popular notion of benthamit that thei ar
enemi of poetri thi wa partli true of bentham himself he us to
sai that all poetri is misrepresent but in the sens in which he
said it the same might have been said of all impress speech of all
represent or inculc more orator in it charact than a
sum in arithmet an articl of bingham in the first number of the
westminst review in which he offer as an explan of someth
which he dislik in moor that mr moor is a poet and therefor
is not a reason did a good deal to attach the notion of hate
poetri to the writer in the review but the truth wa that mani of us
were great reader of poetri bingham himself had been a writer of it
while as regard me and the same thing might be said of my father the
correct statement would be not that i dislik poetri but that i wa
theoret indiffer to it i dislik ani sentiment in poetri
which i should have dislik in prose and that includ a great deal
and i wa wholli blind to it place in human cultur as a mean of
educ the feel but i wa alwai person veri suscept to
some kind of it in the most sectarian period of my bentham i
happen to look into pope essai on man and though everi opinion
in it wa contrari to mine i well rememb how powerfulli it act on
my imagin perhap at that time poetic composit of ani higher
type than eloqu discuss in vers might not have produc a
similar effect upon me at all event i seldom gave it an opportun
thi howev wa a mere passiv state long befor i had enlarg in
ani consider degre the basi of my intellectu creed i had
obtain in the natur cours of my mental progress poetic cultur of
the most valuabl kind by mean of reverenti admir for the live
and charact of heroic person especi the hero of philosophi
the same inspir effect which so mani of the benefactor of mankind
have left on record that thei had experienc from plutarch live
wa produc on me by plato pictur of socrat and by some modern
biographi abov all by condorcet life of turgot a book well
calcul to rous the best sort of enthusiasm sinc it contain on
of the wisest and noblest of live delin by on of the wisest and
noblest of men the heroic virtu of these gloriou repres of
the opinion with which i sympath deepli affect me and i
perpetu recur to them as other do to a favourit poet when
need to be carri up into the more elev region of feel and
thought i mai observ by the wai that thi book cure me of my
sectarian folli the two or three page begin il regardait tout
sect comm nuisibl and explain why turgot alwai kept himself
perfectli distinct from the encyclopedist sank deepli into my mind
i left off design myself and other as utilitarian and by the
pronoun we or ani other collect design i ceas to
affich sectarian my real inward sectarian i did not get rid
of till later and much more gradual
about the end of 1824 or begin of 1825 mr bentham have late
got back hi paper on evid from m dumont whose trait de
preuv judiciair ground on them wa then first complet and
publish resolv to have them print in the origin and bethought
himself of me as capabl of prepar them for the press in the same
manner as hi book of fallaci had been recent edit by bingham
i gladli undertook thi task and it occupi nearli all my leisur for
about a year exclus of the time afterward spent in see the five
larg volum through the press mr bentham had begun thi treatis
three time at consider interv each time in a differ
manner and each time without refer to the preced two of the
three time he had gone over nearli the whole subject these three
mass of manuscript it wa my busi to condens into a singl
treatis adopt the on last written as the groundwork and
incorpor with it as much of the two other as it had not complet
supersed i had also to unrol such of bentham involv and
parenthet sentenc as seem to overpass by their complex the
measur of what reader were like to take the pain to understand it
wa further mr bentham particular desir that i should from myself
endeavour to suppli ani lacuna which he had left and at hi instanc
i read for thi purpos the most authorit treatis on the
english law of evid and comment on a few of the objection
point of the english rule which had escap bentham notic i also
repli to the object which had been made to some of hi doctrin
by review of dumont book and ad a few supplementari remark on
some of the more abstract part of the subject such as the theori of
improb and imposs the controversi part of these
editori addit wa written in a more assum tone than becam on
so young and inexperienc as i wa but inde i had never contempl
come forward in my own person and as an anonym editor of bentham i
fell into the tone of my author not think it unsuit to him or to
the subject howev it might be so to me my name as editor wa put to
the book after it wa print at mr bentham posit desir which i
in vain attempt to persuad him to forego
the time occupi in thi editori work wa extrem well emploi in
respect to my own improv the rational of judici evid is
on of the richest in matter of all bentham product the theori of
evid be in itself on of the most import of hi subject and
ramifi into most of the other the book contain veri fulli
develop a great proport of all hi best thought while among
more special thing it compris the most elabor exposur of the
vice and defect of english law as it then wa which is to be found
in hi work not confin to the law of evid but includ by wai
of illustr episod the entir procedur or practic of westminst
hall the direct knowledg therefor which i obtain from the book
and which wa imprint upon me much more thoroughli than it could have
been by mere read wa itself no small acquisit but thi
occup did for me what might seem less to be expect it gave a
great start to my power of composit everyth which i wrote
subsequ to thi editori employ wa markedli superior to
anyth that i had written befor it bentham later style as the
world know wa heavi and cumbersom from the excess of a good
qualiti the love of precis which made him introduc claus within
claus into the heart of everi sentenc that the reader might receiv
into hi mind all the modif and qualif simultan
with the main proposit and the habit grew on him until hi sentenc
becam to those not accustom to them most labori read but hi
earlier style that of the fragment on govern plan of a judici
establish etc is a model of liveli and eas combin with
ful of matter scarc ever surpass and of thi earlier style
there were mani strike specimen in the manuscript on evid all
of which i endeavour to preserv so long a cours of thi admir
write had a consider effect upon my own and i ad to it by the
assidu read of other writer both french and english who
combin in a remark degre eas with forc such as goldsmith
field pascal voltair and courier through these influenc my
write lost the jejun of my earli composit the bone and
cartilag began to cloth themselv with flesh and the style becam
at time live and almost light
thi improv wa first exhibit in a new field mr marshal of
leed father of the present gener of marshal the same who wa
brought into parliament for yorkshir when the represent forfeit
by grampound wa transfer to it an earnest parliamentari reform
and a man of larg fortun of which he made a liber us had been
much struck with bentham book of fallaci and the thought had
occur to him that it would be us to publish annual the
parliamentari debat not in the chronolog order of hansard but
classifi accord to subject and accompani by a commentari
point out the fallaci of the speaker with thi intent he veri
natur address himself to the editor of the book of fallaci
and bingham with the assist of charl austin undertook the
editorship the work wa call parliamentari histori and review it
sale wa not suffici to keep it in exist and it onli last
three year it excit howev some attent among parliamentari and
polit peopl the best strength of the parti wa put forth in it
and it execut did them much more credit than that of the
westminst review had ever done bingham and charl austin wrote
much in it as did strutt romilli and sever other liber lawyer
my father wrote on articl in hi best style the elder austin anoth
coulson wrote on of great merit it fell to my lot to lead off the
first number by an articl on the princip topic of the session that
of 1825 the cathol associ and the cathol disabl in the
second number i wrote an elabor essai on the commerci crisi of
1825 and the currenc debat in the third i had two articl on on
a minor subject the other on the reciproc principl in commerc
propo of a celebr diplomat correspond between can
and gallatin these write were no longer mere reproduct and
applic of the doctrin i had been taught thei were origin
think as far as that name can be appli to old idea in new form
and connexion and i do not exce the truth in sai that there wa a
matur and a welldigest charact about them which there had not
been in ani of my previou perform in execut therefor thei
were not at all juvenil but their subject have either gone by or
have been so much better treat sinc that thei ar entir
supersed and should remain buri in the same oblivion with my
contribut to the first dynasti of the westminst review
while thu engag in write for the public i did not neglect other
mode of selfcultiv it wa at thi time that i learnt german
begin it on the hamiltonian method for which purpos i and sever
of my companion form a class for sever year from thi period our
social studi assum a shape which contribut veri much to my mental
progress the idea occur to us of carri on by read and
convers a joint studi of sever of the branch of scienc which
we wish to be master of we assembl to the number of a dozen or
more mr grote lent a room of hi hous in threadneedl street for the
purpos and hi partner prescott on of the three origin member of
the utilitarian societi made on among us we met two morn in everi
week from halfpast eight till ten at which hour most of us were
call off to our daili occup our first subject wa polit
economi we chose some systemat treatis as our textbook my father
element be our first choic on of us read aloud a chapter or
some smaller portion of the book the discuss wa then open and
anyon who had an object or other remark to make made it our rule
wa to discuss thoroughli everi point rais whether great or small
prolong the discuss until all who took part were satisfi with
the conclus thei had individu arriv at and to follow up everi
topic of collater specul which the chapter or the convers
suggest never leav it until we had unti everi knot which we
found we repeatedli kept up the discuss of some on point for
sever week think intent on it dure the interv of our
meet and contriv solut of the new difficulti which had
risen up in the last morn discuss when we had finish in thi
wai my father element we went in the same manner through ricardo
principl of polit economi and bailei dissert on valu
these close and vigor discuss were not onli improv in a high
degre to those who took part in them but brought out new view of some
topic of abstract polit economi the theori of intern valu
which i afterward publish eman from these convers as did
also the modifi form of ricardo theori of profit laid down in my
essai on profit and interest those among us with whom new
specul chiefli origin were elli graham and i though
other gave valuabl aid to the discuss especi prescott and
roebuck the on by hi knowledg the other by hi dialect
acut the theori of intern valu and of profit were
excogit and work out in about equal proport by myself and
graham and if our origin project had been execut my essai on
some unsettl question of polit economi would have been brought
out along with some paper of hi under our joint name but when my
exposit came to be written i found that i had so much overestim
my agreement with him and he dissent so much from the most origin
of the two essai that on intern valu that i wa oblig to
consid the theori as now exclus mine and it came out as such
when publish mani year later i mai mention that among the
alter which my father made in revis hi element for the
third edit sever were found on critic elicit by these
convers and in particular he modifi hi opinion though not to
the extent of our new specul on both the point to which i
have advert
when we had enough of polit economi we took up the syllogist
logic in the same manner grote now join us our first textbook wa
aldrich but be disgust with it superfici we reprint on
of the most finish among the mani manual of the school logic which
my father a great collector of such book possess the manuductio
ad logicam of the jesuit du trieu after finish thi we took up
whate logic then first republish from the encyclopedia
metropolitana and final the computatio sive logica of hobb
these book dealt with in our manner afford a high rang for
origin metaphys specul and most of what ha been done in the
first book of my system of logic to ration and correct the
principl and distinct of the school logician and to improv the
theori of the import of proposit had it origin in these
discuss graham and i origin most of the novelti while grote
and other furnish an excel tribun or test from thi time i
form the project of write a book on logic though on a much humbler
scale than the on i ultim execut
have done with logic we launch into analyt psycholog and have
chosen hartlei for our textbook we rais priestlei edit to an
extravag price by search through london to furnish each of us with
a copi when we had finish hartlei we suspend our meet but my
father analysi of the mind be publish soon after we
reassembl for the purpos of read it with thi our exercis
end i have alwai date from these convers my own real
inaugur as an origin and independ thinker it wa also through
them that i acquir or veri much strengthen a mental habit to which
i attribut all that i have ever done or ever shall do in specul
that of never accept halfsolut of difficulti as complet
never abandon a puzzl but again and again return to it until it
wa clear up never allow obscur corner of a subject to remain
unexplor becaus thei did not appear import never think that i
perfectli understood ani part of a subject until i understood the whole
our do from 1825 to 1830 in the wai of public speak fill a
consider place in my life dure those year and as thei had
import effect on my develop someth ought to be said of them
there wa for some time in exist a societi of owenit call the
cooper societi which met for weekli public discuss in
chanceri lane in the earli part of 1825 accid brought roebuck in
contact with sever of it member and led to hi attend on or two
of the meet and take part in the debat in opposit to owen
some on of us start the notion of go there in a bodi and have a
gener battl and charl austin and some of hi friend who did not
usual take part in our joint exercis enter into the project it
wa carri out by concert with the princip member of the societi
themselv noth loth as thei natur prefer a controversi with
oppon to a tame discuss among their own bodi the question of
popul wa propos as the subject of debat charl austin led the
case on our side with a brilliant speech and the fight wa kept up by
adjourn through five or six weekli meet befor crowd
auditori includ along with the member of the societi and their
friend mani hearer and some speaker from the inn of court when
thi debat wa end anoth wa commenc on the gener merit of
owen system and the contest altogeth last about three month it
wa a lutt corp corp between owenit and polit economist
whom the owenit regard as their most inveter oppon but it
wa a perfectli friendli disput we who repres polit economi
had the same object in view as thei had and took pain to show it and
the princip champion on their side wa a veri estim man with whom
i wa well acquaint mr william thompson of cork author of a book
on the distribut of wealth and of an appeal in behalf of women
against the passag relat to them in my father essai on
govern elli roebuck and i took an activ part in the debat
and among those from the inn of court who join in it i rememb
charl villier the other side obtain also on the popul
question veri effici support from without the wellknown gale
jone then an elderli man made on of hi florid speech but the
speaker with whom i wa most struck though i dissent from nearli
everi word he said wa thirlwal the historian sinc bishop of st
david then a chanceri barrist unknown except by a high reput
for eloqu acquir at the cambridg union befor the era of austin
and macaulai hi speech wa in answer to on of mine befor he had
utter ten sentenc i set him down as the best speaker i had ever
heard and i have never sinc heard anyon whom i place abov him
the great interest of these debat predispos some of those who took
part in them to catch at a suggest thrown out by mcculloch the
polit economist that a societi wa want in london similar to the
specul societi at edinburgh in which brougham horner and other
first cultiv public speak our experi at the cooper
societi seem to give caus for be sanguin as to the sort of men
who might be brought togeth in london for such a purpos mcculloch
mention the matter to sever young men of influenc to whom he wa
then give privat lesson in polit economi some of these enter
warmli into the project particularli georg villier after earl of
clarendon he and hi brother hyde and charl romilli charl
austin and i with some other met and agre on a plan we determin
to meet onc a fortnight from novemb to june at the freemason
tavern and we had soon a fine list of member contain along with
sever member of parliament nearli all the most note speaker of the
cambridg union and of the oxford unit debat societi it is
curious illustr of the tendenc of the time that our princip
difficulti in recruit for the societi wa to find a suffici number
of tori speaker almost all whom we could press into the servic were
liber of differ order and degre besid those alreadi name
we had macaulai thirlwal pra lord howick samuel wilberforc
afterward bishop of oxford charl poulett thomson afterward lord
sydenham edward and henri lytton bulwer fonblanqu and mani other
whom i cannot now recollect but who made themselv afterward more or
less conspicu in public or literari life noth could seem more
promis but when the time for action drew near and it wa necessari
to fix on a presid and find somebodi to open the first debat none
of our celebr would consent to perform either offic of the mani
who were press on the subject the onli on who could be prevail on
wa a man of whom i knew veri littl but who had taken high honour at
oxford and wa said to have acquir a great orator reput
there who some time afterward becam a tori member of parliament he
accordingli wa fix on both for fill the presid chair and for
make the first speech the import dai arriv the bench were
crowd all our great speaker were present to judg of but not to
help our effort the oxford orat speech wa a complet failur
thi threw a damp on the whole concern the speaker who follow were
few and none of them did their best the affair wa a complet
fiasco and the orator celebr we had count on went awai
never to return give to me at least a lesson in knowledg of the
world thi unexpect breakdown alter my whole relat to the
project i had not anticip take a promin part or speak much
or often particularli at first but i now saw that the success of the
scheme depend on the new men and i put my shoulder to the wheel i
open the second question and from that time spoke in nearli everi
debat it wa veri uphil work for some time the three villier and
romilli stuck to us for some time longer but the patienc of all the
founder of the societi wa at last exhaust except me and roebuck in
the season follow 18267 thing began to mend we had acquir two
excel tori speaker hayward and shee afterward sergeant shee
the radic side wa reinforc by charl buller cockburn and other
of the second gener of cambridg bentham and with their and
other occasion aid and the two tori as well as roebuck and me for
regular speaker almost everi debat wa a batail rang between
the philosoph radic and the tori lawyer until our conflict
were talk about and sever person of note and consider came to
hear us thi happen still more in the subsequ season 1828 and
1829 when the coleridgian in the person of mauric and sterl
made their appear in the societi as a second liber and even
radic parti on total differ ground from bentham and
vehement oppos to it bring into these discuss the gener
doctrin and mode of thought of the european reaction against the
philosophi of the eighteenth centuri and ad a third and veri
import belliger parti to our contest which were now no bad
expon of the movement of opinion among the most cultiv part of
the new gener our debat were veri differ from those of common
debat societi for thei habitu consist of the strongest
argument and most philosoph principl which either side wa abl to
produc thrown often into close and serr confut of on
anoth the practic wa necessarili veri us to us and emin
so to me i never inde acquir real fluenci and had alwai a bad
and ungrac deliveri but i could make myself listen to and as i
alwai wrote my speech when from the feel involv or the natur
of the idea to be develop express seem import i greatli
increas my power of effect write acquir not onli an ear for
smooth and rhythm but a practic sens for tell sentenc
and an immedi criterion of their tell properti by their effect on
a mix audienc
the societi and the prepar for it togeth with the prepar
for the morn convers which were go on simultan
occupi the greater part of my leisur and made me feel it a relief
when in the spring of 1828 i ceas to write for the westminst
the review had fallen into difficulti though the sale of the first
number had been veri encourag the perman sale had never i
believ been suffici to pai the expens on the scale on which the
review wa carri on those expens had been consider but not
suffici reduc on of the editor southern had resign and
sever of the writer includ my father and me who had been paid
like other contributor for our earlier articl had latterli written
without payment nevertheless the origin fund were nearli or quit
exhaust and if the review wa to be continu some new arrang
of it affair had becom indispens my father and i had sever
confer with bowr on the subject we were will to do our
utmost for maintain the review as an organ of our opinion but not
under bowr editorship while the imposs of it ani longer
support a paid editor afford a ground on which without affront to
him we could propos to dispens with hi servic we and some of our
friend were prepar to carri on the review as unpaid writer either
find among ourselv an unpaid editor or share the editorship
among us but while thi negoti wa proceed with bowr
appar acquiesc he wa carri on anoth in a differ quarter
with colonel perronet thompson of which we receiv the first
intim in a letter from bowr as editor inform us mere that
an arrang had been made and propos to us to write for the next
number with promis of payment we did not disput bowr right to
bring about if he could an arrang more favour to himself than
the on we had propos but we thought the conceal which he had
practis toward us while seemingli enter into our own project an
affront and even had we not thought so we were indispos to expend
ani more of our time and troubl in attempt to write up the review
under hi manag accordingli my father excus himself from
write though two or three year later on great pressur he did
write on more polit articl as for me i posit refus and
thu end my connexion with the origin westminst the last
articl which i wrote in it had cost me more labour than ani previou
but it wa a labour of love be a defenc of the earli french
revolutionist against the tori misrepresent of sir walter scott
in the introduct to hi life of napoleon the number of book which
i read for thi purpos make note and extractseven the number i
had to bui for in those dai there wa no public or subscript
librari from which book of refer could be taken homefar exceed
the worth of the immedi object but i had at that time a halfform
intent of write a histori of the french revolut and though i
never execut it my collect afterward were veri us to carlyl
for a similar purpos
chapter v
crisi in my mental histori on stage onward
for some year after thi time i wrote veri littl and noth
regularli for public and great were the advantag which i
deriv from the intermiss it wa of no common import to me at
thi period to be abl to digest and matur my thought for my own mind
onli without ani immedi call for give them out in print had i
gone on write it would have much disturb the import
transform in my opinion and charact which took place dure
those year the origin of thi transform or at least the process
by which i wa prepar for it can onli be explain by turn some
distanc back
from the winter of 1821 when i first read bentham and especi from
the commenc of the westminst review i had what might truli be
call an object in life to be a reform of the world my concept
of my own happi wa entir identifi with thi object the
person sympathi i wish for were those of fellow labour in thi
enterpris i endeavour to pick up as mani flower as i could by the
wai but as a seriou and perman person satisfact to rest upon
my whole relianc wa place on thi and i wa accustom to felicit
myself on the certainti of a happi life which i enjoi through place
my happi in someth durabl and distant in which some progress
might be alwai make while it could never be exhaust by complet
attain thi did veri well for sever year dure which the
gener improv go on in the world and the idea of myself as
engag with other in struggl to promot it seem enough to fill
up an interest and anim exist but the time came when i
awaken from thi as from a dream it wa in the autumn of 1826 i wa
in a dull state of nerv such as everybodi is occasion liabl to
unsuscept to enjoy or pleasur excit on of those mood
when what is pleasur at other time becom insipid or indiffer
the state i should think in which convert to method usual ar
when smitten by their first convict of sin in thi frame of mind
it occur to me to put the question directli to myself suppos that
all your object in life were realiz that all the chang in

happi to you and an irrepress selfconsci distinctli
answer no at thi my heart sank within me the whole foundat on

been found in the continu pursuit of thi end the end had ceas to
charm and how could there ever again be ani interest in the mean i
seem to have noth left to live for
at first i hope that the cloud would pass awai of itself but it did
not a night sleep the sovereign remedi for the smaller vexat of
life had no effect on it i awok to a renew conscious of the
woful fact i carri it with me into all compani into all
occup hardli anyth had power to caus me even a few minut
oblivion of it for some month the cloud seem to grow thicker and
thicker the line in coleridg dejectioni wa not then acquaint
with themexactli describ my case
a grief without a pang void dark and drear
a drowsi stifl unimpass grief
which find no natur outlet or relief
in word or sigh or tear
in vain i sought relief from my favourit book those memori of past
nobl and great from which i had alwai hitherto drawn strength
and anim i read them now without feel or with the accustom
feel minu all it charm and i becam persuad that my love of
mankind and of excel for it own sake had worn itself out i
sought no comfort by speak to other of what i felt if i had love
anyon suffici to make confid my grief a necess i should
not have been in the condit i wa i felt too that mine wa not an
interest or in ani wai respect distress there wa noth in it
to attract sympathi advic if i had known where to seek it would have
been most preciou the word of macbeth to the physician often occur
to my thought but there wa no on on whom i could build the faintest
hope of such assist my father to whom it would have been natur
to me to have recours in ani practic difficulti wa the last
person to whom in such a case as thi i look for help everyth
convinc me that he had no knowledg of ani such mental state as i wa
suffer from and that even if he could be made to understand it he
wa not the physician who could heal it my educ which wa wholli
hi work had been conduct without ani regard to the possibl of
it end in thi result and i saw no us in give him the pain of
think that hi plan had fail when the failur wa probabl
irremedi and at all event beyond the power of hi remedi of
other friend i had at that time none to whom i had ani hope of make
my condit intellig it wa howev abundantli intellig to
myself and the more i dwelt upon it the more hopeless it appear
my cours of studi had led me to believ that all mental and moral
feel and qualiti whether of a good or of a bad kind were the
result of associ that we love on thing and hate anoth take
pleasur in on sort of action or contempl and pain in anoth
sort through the cling of pleasur or pain idea to those
thing from the effect of educ or of experi as a corollari
from thi i had alwai heard it maintain by my father and wa myself
convinc that the object of educ should be to form the strongest
possibl associ of the salutari class associ of pleasur
with all thing benefici to the great whole and of pain with all
thing hurt to it thi doctrin appear inexpugn but it now
seem to me on retrospect that my teacher had occupi themselv
but superfici with the mean of form and keep up these
salutari associ thei seem to have trust altogeth to the old
familiar instrument prais and blame reward and punish now i
did not doubt that by these mean begun earli and appli unremittingli
intens associ of pain and pleasur especi of pain might be
creat and might produc desir and avers capabl of last
undiminish to the end of life but there must alwai be someth
artifici and casual in associ thu produc the pain and
pleasur thu forcibl associ with thing ar not connect with
them by ani natur tie and it is therefor i thought essenti to
the durabl of these associ that thei should have becom so
intens and inveter as to be practic indissolubl befor the
habitu exercis of the power of analysi had commenc for i now saw
or thought i saw what i had alwai befor receiv with incredul
that the habit of analysi ha a tendenc to wear awai the feel
as inde it ha when no other mental habit is cultiv and the
analys spirit remain without it natur complement and
correct the veri excel of analysi i argu is that it tend
to weaken and undermin whatev is the result of prejudic that it
enabl us mental to separ idea which have onli casual clung
togeth and no associ whatev could ultim resist thi
dissolv forc were it not that we ow to analysi our clearest
knowledg of the perman sequenc in natur the real connexion
between thing not depend on our will and feel natur law
by virtu of which in mani case on thing is insepar from anoth
in fact which law in proport as thei ar clearli perceiv and
imagin realiz caus our idea of thing which ar alwai
join togeth in natur to coher more and more close in our
thought analyt habit mai thu even strengthen the associ
between caus and effect mean and end but tend altogeth to
weaken those which ar to speak familiarli a mere matter of feel
thei ar therefor i thought favour to prudenc and clear
sighted but a perpetu worm at the root both of the passion and
of the virtu and abov all fearfulli undermin all desir and
all pleasur which ar the effect of associ that is accord
to the theori i held all except the pure physic and organ of the
entir insuffici of which to make life desir no on had a
stronger convict than i had these were the law of human natur by
which as it seem to me i had been brought to my present state all
those to whom i look up were of opinion that the pleasur of sympathi
with human be and the feel which made the good of other and
especi of mankind on a larg scale the object of exist were
the greatest and surest sourc of happi of the truth of thi i wa
convinc but to know that a feel would make me happi if i had it
did not give me the feel my educ i thought had fail to
creat these feel in suffici strength to resist the dissolv
influenc of analysi while the whole cours of my intellectu
cultiv had made precoci and prematur analysi the inveter
habit of my mind i wa thu as i said to myself left strand at the
commenc of my voyag with a wellequip ship and a rudder but
no sail without ani real desir for the end which i had been so
carefulli fit out to work for no delight in virtu or the gener
good but also just as littl in anyth els the fountain of vaniti
and ambit seem to have dri up within me as complet as those
of benevol i had had as i reflect some gratif of vaniti
at too earli an ag i had obtain some distinct and felt myself of
some import befor the desir of distinct and of import had
grown into a passion and littl as it wa which i had attain yet
have been attain too earli like all pleasur enjoi too soon it
had made me bla and indiffer to the pursuit thu neither selfish
nor unselfish pleasur were pleasur to me and there seem no power
in natur suffici to begin the format of my charact anew and
creat in a mind now irretriev analyt fresh associ of
pleasur with ani of the object of human desir
these were the thought which mingl with the dry heavi deject of
the melancholi winter of 18267 dure thi time i wa not incap of
my usual occup i went on with them mechan by the mere
forc of habit i had been so drill in a certain sort of mental
exercis that i could still carri it on when all the spirit had gone
out of it i even compos and spoke sever speech at the debat
societi how or with what degre of success i know not of four year
continu speak at that societi thi is the onli year of which i
rememb next to noth two line of coleridg in whom alon of all
writer i have found a true descript of what i felt were often in my
thought not at thi time for i had never read them but in a later
period of the same mental maladi
work without hope draw nectar in a siev
and hope without an object cannot live
in all probabl my case wa by no mean so peculiar as i fanci it
and i doubt not that mani other have pass through a similar state
but the idiosyncrasi of my educ had given to the gener
phenomenon a special charact which made it seem the natur effect of
caus that it wa hardli possibl for time to remov i frequent
ask myself if i could or if i wa bound to go on live when life
must be pass in thi manner i gener answer to myself that i did
not think i could possibl bear it beyond a year when howev not
more than half that durat of time had elaps a small rai of light
broke in upon my gloom i wa read accident marmontel
mmoir and came to the passag which relat hi father death
the distress posit of the famili and the sudden inspir by
which he then a mere boi felt and made them feel that he would be
everyth to themwould suppli the place of all that thei had lost a
vivid concept of the scene and it feel came over me and i wa
move to tear from thi moment my burden grew lighter the oppress
of the thought that all feel wa dead within me wa gone i wa no
longer hopeless i wa not a stock or a stone i had still it seem
some of the materi out of which all worth of charact and all
capac for happi ar made reliev from my everpres sens of
irremedi wretched i gradual found that the ordinari incid
of life could again give me some pleasur that i could again find
enjoy not intens but suffici for cheer in sunshin and
sky in book in convers in public affair and that there wa
onc more excit though of a moder kind in exert myself
for my opinion and for the public good thu the cloud gradual drew
off and i again enjoi life and though i had sever relaps some
of which last mani month i never again wa as miser as i
had been
the experi of thi period had two veri mark effect on my opinion
and charact in the first place thei led me to adopt a theori of life
veri unlik that on which i had befor i act and have much in common
with what at that time i certainli had never heard of the antiself
conscious theori of carlyl i never inde waver in the convict
that happi is the test of all rule of conduct and the end of life
but i now thought that thi end wa onli to be attain by not make it
the direct end those onli ar happi i thought who have their mind
fix on some object other than their own happi on the happi of
other on the improv of mankind even on some art or pursuit
follow not as a mean but as itself an ideal end aim thu at
someth els thei find happi by the wai the enjoy of life
such wa now my theori ar suffici to make it a pleasant thing
when thei ar taken en passant without be made a princip object
onc make them so and thei ar immedi felt to be insuffici
thei will not bear a scrutin examin ask yourself whether you
ar happi and you ceas to be so the onli chanc is to treat not
happi but some end extern to it as the purpos of life let your
selfconsci your scrutini your selfinterrog exhaust
themselv on that and if otherwis fortun circumstanc you will
inhal happi with the air you breath without dwell on it or
think about it without either forestal it in imagin or
put it to flight by fatal question thi theori now becam the
basi of my philosophi of life and i still hold to it as the best
theori for all those who have but a moder degre of sensibl and
of capac i for enjoy that is for the great major of mankind
the other import chang which my opinion at thi time underw wa
that i for the first time gave it proper place among the prime
necess of human wellb to the intern cultur of the
individu i ceas to attach almost exclus import to the
order of outward circumst and the train of the human be
for specul and for action
i had now learnt by experi that the pass suscept need
to be cultiv as well as the activ capac and requir to be
nourish and enrich as well as guid i did not for an instant
lose sight of or undervalu that part of the truth which i had seen
befor i never turn recreant to intellectu cultur or ceas to
consid the power and practic of analysi as an essenti condit
both of individu and of social improv but 1 thought that it had
consequ which requir to be correct by join other kind of
cultiv with it the mainten of a due balanc among the
faculti now seem to be of primari import the cultiv of the
feel becam on of the cardin point in my ethic and philosoph
creed and my thought and inclin turn in an increas degre
toward whatev seem capabl of be instrument to that object
i now began to find mean in the thing which i had read or heard
about the import of poetri and art as instrument of human cultur
but it wa some time longer befor i began to know thi by person
experi the onli on of the imagin art in which i had from
childhood taken great pleasur wa music the best effect of which and
in thi it surpass perhap everi other art consist in excit
enthusiasm in wind up to a high pitch those feel of an elev
kind which ar alreadi in the charact but to which thi excit
give a glow and a fervour which though transitori at it utmost
height is preciou for sustain them at other time thi effect of
music i had often experienc but like all my pleasur
suscept it wa suspend dure the gloomi period i had
sought relief again and again from thi quarter but found none after
the tide had turn and i wa in process of recoveri i had been help
forward by music but in a much less elev manner i at thi time
first becam acquaint with weber oberon and the extrem pleasur
which i drew from it delici melodi did me good by show me a
sourc of pleasur to which i wa as suscept as ever the good
howev wa much impair by the thought that the pleasur of music
as is quit true of such pleasur as thi wa that of mere tune fade
with familiar and requir either to be reviv by intermitt or
fed by continu novelti and it is veri characterist both of my then
state and of the gener tone of my mind at thi period of my life
that i wa serious torment by the thought of the exhaust of
music combin the octav consist onli of five tone and two
semiton which can be put togeth in onli a limit number of wai
of which but a small proport ar beauti most of these it seem
to me must have been alreadi discov and there could not be room
for a long success of mozart and weber to strike out as these had
done entir new and surpassingli rich vein of music beauti thi
sourc of anxieti mai perhap be thought to resembl that of the
philosoph of laputa who fear lest the sun should be burnt out it
wa howev connect with the best featur in my charact and the
onli good point to be found in my veri unromant and in no wai
honour distress for though my deject honestli look at could
not be call other than egotist produc by the ruin as i thought
of my fabric of happi yet the destini of mankind in gener wa ever
in my thought and could not be separ from my own i felt that the
flaw in my life must be a flaw in life itself that the question wa
whether if the reform of societi and govern could succe in
their object and everi person in the commun were free and in a state
of physic comfort the pleasur of life be no longer kept up by
struggl and privat would ceas to be pleasur and i felt that
unless i could see my wai to some better hope than thi for human
happi in gener my deject must continu but that if i could
see such an outlet i should then look on the world with pleasur
content as far as i wa myself concern with ani fair share of the
gener lot
thi state of my thought and feel made the fact of my read
wordsworth for the first time in the autumn of 1828 an import
event of my life i took up the collect of hi poem from curios
with no expect of mental relief from it though i had befor
resort to poetri with that hope in the worst period of my depress
i had read through the whole of byron then new to me to try whether a
poet whose peculiar depart wa suppos to be that of the intens
feel could rous ani feel in me as might be expect i got no
good from thi read but the revers the poet state of mind wa
too like my own hi wa the lament of a man who had worn out all
pleasur and who seem to think that life to all who possess the
good thing of it must necessarili be the vapid uninterest thing
which i found it hi harold and manfr had the same burden on them
which i had and i wa not in a frame of mind to desir ani comfort from
the vehement sensual passion of hi giaour or the sullen of hi
lara but while byron wa exactli what did not suit my condit
wordsworth wa exactli what did i had look into the excurs two
or three year befor and found littl in it and i should probabl
have found as littl had i read it at thi time but the miscellan
poem in the twovolum edit of 1815 to which littl of valu wa
ad in the latter part of the author life prove to be the precis
thing for my mental want at that particular junctur
in the first place these poem address themselv powerfulli to on
of the strongest of my pleasur suscept the love of rural
object and natur sceneri to which i had been indebt not onli for
much of the pleasur of my life but quit recent for relief from on
of my longest relaps into depress in thi power of rural beauti
over me there wa a foundat laid for take pleasur in wordsworth
poetri the more so as hi sceneri li mostli among mountain which
ow to my earli pyrenean excurs were my ideal of natur beauti
but wordsworth would never have had ani great effect on me if he had
mere place befor me beauti pictur of natur sceneri scott
doe thi still better than wordsworth and a veri secondr landscap
doe it more effectu than ani poet what made wordsworth poem a
medicin for my state of mind wa that thei express not mere outward
beauti but state of feel and of thought colour by feel under
the excit of beauti thei seem to be the veri cultur of the
feel which i wa in quest of in them i seem to draw from a
sourc of inward joi of sympathet and imagin pleasur which
could be share in by all human be which had no connect with
struggl or imperfect but would be made richer by everi improv
in the physic or social condit of mankind from them i seem to
learn what would be the perenni sourc of happi when all the
greater evil of life shall have been remov and i felt myself at onc
better and happier as i came under their influenc there have certainli
been even in our own ag greater poet than wordsworth but poetri of
deeper and loftier feel could not have done for me at that time what
hi did i need to be made to feel that there wa real perman
happi in tranquil contempl wordsworth taught me thi not onli
without turn awai from but with a greatli increas interest in the
common feel and common destini of human be and the delight
which these poem gave me prove that with cultur of thi sort there
wa noth to dread from the most confirm habit of analysi at the
conclus of the poem came the famou od fals call platon
intim of immort in which along with more than hi usual
sweet of melodi and rhythm and along with the two passag of grand
imageri but bad philosophi so often quot i found that he too had had
similar experi to mine that he also had felt that the first
fresh of youth enjoy of life wa not last but that he had
sought for compens and found it in the wai in which he wa now
teach me to find it the result wa that i gradual but complet
emerg from my habitu depress and wa never again subject to it
i long continu to valu wordsworth less accord to hi intrins
merit than by the measur of what he had done for me compar with
the greatest poet he mai be said to be the poet of unpoet natur
possess of quiet and contempl tast but unpoet natur ar
precis those which requir poetic cultiv thi cultiv
wordsworth is much more fit to give than poet who ar intrins
far more poet than he
it so fell out that the merit of wordsworth were the occas of my
first public declar of my new wai of think and separ from
those of my habitu companion who had not undergon a similar chang
the person with whom at that time i wa most in the habit of compar
note on such subject wa roebuck and i induc him to read
wordsworth in whom he also at first seem to find much to admir but
i like most wordsworthian threw myself into strong antagon to
byron both as a poet and as to hi influenc on the charact roebuck
all whose instinct were those of action and struggl had on the
contrari a strong relish and great admir of byron whose write
he regard as the poetri of human life while wordsworth accord
to him wa that of flower and butterfli we agre to have the fight
out at our debat societi where we accordingli discuss for two
even the compar merit of byron and wordsworth propound and
illustr by long recit our respect theori of poetri
sterl also in a brilliant speech put forward hi particular
theori thi wa the first debat on ani weighti subject in which
roebuck and i had been on opposit side the schism between us widen
from thi time more and more though we continu for some year longer
to be companion in the begin our chief diverg relat to the
cultiv of the feel roebuck wa in mani respect veri differ
from the vulgar notion of a benthamit or utilitarian he wa a lover of
poetri and of most of the fine art he took great pleasur in music in
dramat perform especi in paint and himself drew and
design landscap with great facil and beauti but he never could
be made to see that these thing have ani valu as aid in the format
of charact person instead of be as benthamit ar suppos
to be void of feel he had veri quick and strong sensibl but
like most englishmen who have feel he found hi feel stand veri
much in hi wai he wa much more suscept to the pain sympathi
than to the pleasur and look for hi happi elsewher he
wish that hi feel should be deaden rather than quicken and
in truth the english charact and english social circumst make
it so seldom possibl to deriv happi from the exercis of the
sympathi that it is not wonder if thei count for littl in an
englishman scheme of life in most other countri the paramount
import of the sympathi as a constitu of individu happi is
an axiom taken for grant rather than need ani formal statement
but most english thinker alwai seem to regard them as necessari evil
requir for keep men action benevol and compassion roebuck
wa or appear to be thi kind of englishman he saw littl good in
ani cultiv of the feel and none at all in cultiv them
through the imagin which he thought wa onli cultiv
illus it wa in vain i urg on him that the imagin emot
which an idea when vividli conceiv excit in us is not an illus
but a fact as real as ani of the other qualiti of object and far
from impli anyth erron and delus in our mental apprehens
of the object is quit consist with the most accur knowledg and
most perfect practic recognit of all it physic and intellectu
law and relat the intensest feel of the beauti of a cloud
light by the set sun is no hindranc to my know that the cloud
is vapour of water subject to all the law of vapour in a state of
suspens and i am just as like to allow for and act on these
physic law whenev there is occas to do so as if i had been
incap of perceiv ani distinct between beauti and ugli
while my intimaci with roebuck diminish i fell more and more into
friendli intercours with our coleridgian adversari in the societi
frederick mauric and john sterl both subsequ so well known
the former by hi write the latter through the biographi by hare
and carlyl of these two friend mauric wa the thinker sterl the
orat and impass expositor of thought which at thi period
were almost entir form for him by mauric
with mauric i had for some time been acquaint through eyton took
who had known him at cambridg and although my discuss with him
were almost alwai disput i had carri awai from them much that
help to build up my new fabric of thought in the same wai as i wa
deriv much from coleridg and from the write of goeth and other
german author which i read dure these year i have so deep a respect
for mauric charact and purpos as well as for hi great mental
gift that it is with some unwilling i sai anyth which mai seem
to place him on a less high emin than i would gladli be abl to
accord to him but i have alwai thought that there wa more
intellectu power wast in mauric than in ani other of my
contemporari few of them certainli have had so much to wast great
power of gener rare ingenu and subtleti and a wide
percept of import and unobvi truth serv him not for put
someth better into the place of the worthless heap of receiv
opinion on the great subject of thought but for prove to hi own
mind that the church of england had known everyth from the first and
that all the truth on the ground of which the church and orthodoxi have
been attack mani of which he saw as clearli as anyon ar not onli
consist with the thirtynin articl but ar better understood and
express in those articl than by anyon who reject them i have
never been abl to find ani other explan of thi than by
attribut it to that timid of conscienc combin with origin
sensit of tempera which ha so often driven highli gift
men into roman from the need of a firmer support than thei can find
in the independ conclus of their own judgment ani more vulgar
kind of timid no on who knew mauric would ever think of imput to
him even if he had not given public proof of hi freedom from it by
hi ultim collis with some of the opinion commonli regard as
orthodox and by hi nobl origin of the christian socialist
movement the nearest parallel to him in a moral point of view is
coleridg to whom in mere intellectu power apart from poetic
geniu i think him decidedli superior at thi time howev he might
be describ as a discipl of coleridg and sterl as a discipl of
coleridg and of him the modif which were take place in my
old opinion gave me some point of contact with them and both mauric
and sterl were of consider us to my develop with sterl i
soon becam veri intim and wa more attach to him than i have ever
been to ani other man he wa inde on of the most lovabl of men hi
frank cordial affection and expans charact a love of truth
alik conspicu in the highest thing and the humblest a gener and
ardent natur which threw itself with impetuos into the opinion it
adopt but wa as eager to do justic to the doctrin and the men it
wa oppos to as to make war on what it thought their error and an
equal devot to the two cardin point of liberti and duti form a
combin of qualiti as attract to me as to all other who knew
him as well as i did with hi open mind and heart he found no
difficulti in join hand with me across the gulf which as yet divid
our opinion he told me how he and other had look upon me from
hearsai inform as a made or manufactur man have had a
certain impress of opinion stamp on me which i could onli reproduc
and what a chang took place in hi feel when he found in the
discuss on wordsworth and byron that wordsworth and all which that
name impli belong to me as much as to him and hi friend the
failur of hi health soon scatter all hi plan of life and
compel him to live at a distanc from london so that after the first
year or two of our acquaint we onli saw each other at distant
interv but as he said himself in on of hi letter to carlyl
when we did meet it wa like brother though he wa never in the full
sens of the word a profound thinker hi open of mind and the
moral courag in which he greatli surpass mauric made him outgrow
the dominion which mauric and coleridg had onc exercis over hi
intellect though he retain to the last a great but discrimin
admir of both and toward mauric a warm affect except in that
short and transitori phasi of hi life dure which he made the
mistak of becom a clergyman hi mind wa ever progress and the
advanc he alwai seem to have made when i saw him after an interv
made me appli to him what goeth said of schiller er hatt ein
furchtlich fortschreitung he and i start from intellectu point
almost as wide apart as the pole but the distanc between us wa
alwai diminish if i made step toward some of hi opinion he
dure hi short life wa constantli approxim more and more to
sever of mine and if he had live and had health and vigour to
prosecut hi ever assidu selfcultur there is no know how much
further thi spontan assimil might have proceed
after 1829 i withdrew from attend on the debat societi i had had
enough of speechmak and wa glad to carri on my privat studi and
medit without ani immedi call for outward assert of their
result i found the fabric of my old and taught opinion give wai in
mani fresh place and i never allow it to fall to piec but wa
incessantli occupi in weav it anew i never in the cours of my
transit wa content to remain for ever so short a time confus
and unsettl when i had taken in ani new idea i could not rest till i
had adjust it relat to my old opinion and ascertain exactli
how far it effect ought to extend in modifi or supersed them
the conflict which i had so often had to sustain in defend the
theori of govern laid down in bentham and my father write
and the acquaint i had obtain with other school of polit
think made me awar of mani thing which that doctrin profess
to be a theori of govern in gener ought to have made room for
and did not but these thing as yet remain with me rather as
correct to be made in appli the theori to practic than as
defect in the theori i felt that polit could not be a scienc of
specif experi and that the accus against the bentham
theori of be a theori of proceed a priori by wai of gener
reason instead of baconian experi show complet ignor of
bacon principl and of the necessari condit of experiment
investig at thi junctur appear in the edinburgh review
macaulai famou attack on my father essai on govern thi gave
me much to think about i saw that macaulai concept of the logic of
polit wa erron that he stood up for the empir mode of
treat polit phenomena against the philosoph that even in
physic scienc hi notion of philosoph might have recognis
kepler but would have exclud newton and laplac but i could not help
feel that though the tone wa unbecom an error for which the
writer at a later period made the most ampl and honour amend
there wa truth in sever of hi strictur on my father treatment of
the subject that my father premis were realli too narrow and
includ but a small number of the gener truth on which in polit
the import consequ depend ident of interest between the
govern bodi and the commun at larg is not in ani practic sens
which can be attach to it the onli thing on which good govern
depend neither can thi ident of interest be secur by the mere
condit of elect i wa not at all satisfi with the mode in
which my father met the critic of macaulai he did not as i thought
he ought to have done justifi himself by sai i wa not write a
scientif treatis on polit i wa write an argument for
parliamentari reform he treat macaulai argument as simpli
irrat an attack upon the reason faculti an exampl of the
sai of hobb that when reason is against a man a man will be
against reason thi made me think that there wa realli someth more
fundament erron in my father concept of philosoph
method as applic to polit than i had hitherto suppos there
wa but i did not at first see clearli what the error might be at last
it flash upon me all at onc in the cours of other studi in the
earli part of 1830 i had begun to put on paper the idea on logic
chiefli on the distinct among term and the import of
proposit which had been suggest and in part work out in the
morn convers alreadi spoken of have secur these thought
from be lost i push on into the other part of the subject to try
whether i could do anyth further toward clear up the theori of
logic gener i grappl at onc with the problem of induct
postpon that of reason on the ground that it is necessari to
obtain premis befor we can reason from them now induct is mainli
a process for find the caus of effect and in attempt to fathom
the mode of trace caus and effect in physic scienc i soon saw
that in the more perfect of the scienc we ascend by gener
from particular to the tendenc of caus consid singli and
then reason downward from those separ tendenc to the effect of
the same caus when combin i then ask myself what is the ultim
analysi of thi deduct process the common theori of the syllog
evid throw no light upon it my practic learnt from hobb and
my father be to studi abstract principl by mean of the best
concret instanc i could find the composit of forc in dynam
occur to me as the most complet exampl of the logic process i wa
investig on examin accordingli what the mind doe when it
appli the principl of the composit of forc i found that it
perform a simpl act of addit it add the separ effect of the
on forc to the separ effect of the other and put down the sum of
these separ effect as the joint effect but is thi a legitim
process in dynam and in all the mathemat branch of physic
it is but in some other case as in chemistri it is not and i then
recollect that someth not unlik thi wa point out as on of the
distinct between chemic and mechan phenomena in the
introduct to that favourit of my boyhood thompson system of
chemistri thi distinct at onc made my mind clear as to what wa
perplex me in respect to the philosophi of polit i now saw that
a scienc is either deduct or experiment accord as in the
provinc it deal with the effect of caus when conjoin ar or ar
not the sum of the effect which the same caus produc when separ
it follow that polit must be a deduct scienc it thu appear
that both macaulai and my father were wrong the on in assimil the
method of philosoph in polit to the pure experiment method
of chemistri while the other though right in adopt a deduct
method had made a wrong select of on have taken as the type of
deduct not the appropri process that of the deduct branch
of natur philosophi but the inappropri on of pure geometri
which not be a scienc of causat at all doe not requir or
admit of ani summingup of effect a foundat wa thu laid in my
thought for the princip chapter of what i afterward publish on
the logic of the moral scienc and my new posit in respect to my
old polit creed now becam perfectli definit
if i am ask what system of polit philosophi i substitut for
that which as a philosophi i had abandon i answer no system onli
a convict that the true system wa someth much more complex and
manysid than i had previous had ani idea of and that it offic
wa to suppli not a set of model institut but principl from
which the institut suitabl to ani given circumst might be
deduc the influenc of european that is to sai continent
thought and especi those of the reaction of the nineteenth centuri
against the eighteenth were now stream in upon me thei came from
variou quarter from the write of coleridg which i had begun to
read with interest even befor the chang in my opinion from the
coleridgian with whom i wa in person intercours from what i had
read of goeth from carlyl earli articl in the edinburgh and
foreign review though for a long time i saw noth in these as my
father saw noth in them to the last but insan rhapsodi from these
sourc and from the acquaint i kept up with the french literatur
of the time i deriv among other idea which the gener turn
upsid down of the opinion of european thinker had brought uppermost
these in particular that the human mind ha a certain order of possibl
progress in which some thing must preced other an order which
govern and public instructor can modifi to some but not to an
unlimit extent that all question of polit institut ar
rel not absolut and that differ stage of human progress not
onli will have but ought to have differ institut that
govern is alwai either in the hand or pass into the hand of
whatev is the strongest power in societi and that what thi power is
doe not depend on institut but institut on it that ani
gener theori or philosophi of polit suppos a previou theori of
human progress and that thi is the same thing with a philosophi of
histori these opinion true in the main were held in an exagger
and violent manner by the thinker with whom i wa now most accustom
to compar note and who as usual with a reaction ignor that half
of the truth which the thinker of the eighteenth centuri saw but
though at on period of my progress i for some time undervalu that
great centuri i never join in the reaction against it but kept as
firm hold of on side of the truth as i took of the other the fight
between the nineteenth centuri and the eighteenth alwai remind me of
the battl about the shield on side of which wa white and the other
black i marvel at the blind rage with which the combat rush
against on anoth i appli to them and to coleridg himself mani
of coleridg sai about half truth and goeth devic
manysided wa on which i would most willingli at thi period
have taken for mine
the writer by whom more than by ani other a new mode of polit
think wa brought home to me were those of the st simonian school
in franc in 1829 and 1830 i becam acquaint with some of their
write thei were then onli in the earlier stage of their
specul thei had not yet dress out their philosophi as a
religion nor had thei organ their scheme of social thei were
just begin to question the principl of hereditari properti i wa
by no mean prepar to go with them even thi length but i wa greatli
struck with the connect view which thei for the first time present
to me of the natur order of human progress and especi with their
divis of all histori into organ period and critic period
dure the organ period thei said mankind accept with firm
convict some posit creed claim jurisdict over all their
action and contain more or less of truth and adapt to the
need of human under it influenc thei make all the progress
compat with the creed and final outgrow it when a period follow
of critic and negat in which mankind lose their old convict
without acquir ani new on of a gener or authorit charact
except the convict that the old ar fals the period of greek and
roman polyth so long as realli believ in by instruct greek and
roman wa an organ period succeed by the critic or sceptic
period of the greek philosoph anoth organ period came in with
christian the correspond critic period began with the
reform ha last ever sinc still last and cannot altogeth
ceas until a new organ period ha been inaugur by the triumph of
a yet more advanc creed these idea i knew were not peculiar to the
st simonian on the contrari thei were the gener properti of
europ or at least of germani and franc but thei had never to my
knowledg been so complet systemat as by these writer nor the
distinguish characterist of a critic period so powerfulli set
forth for i wa not then acquaint with ficht lectur on the
characterist of the present ag in carlyl inde i found bitter
denunci of an ag of unbelief and of the present ag as such
which i like most peopl at that time suppos to be passion
protest in favour of the old mode of belief but all that wa true in
these denunci i thought that i found more calmli and
philosoph state by the st simonian among their public
too there wa on which seem to me far superior to the rest in which
the gener idea wa matur into someth much more definit and
instruct thi wa an earli work of august comt who then call
himself and even announc himself in the titlepag as a pupil of
saint simon in thi tract m comt first put forth the doctrin which
he afterward so copious illustr of the natur success of
three stage in everi depart of human knowledg first the
theolog next the metaphys and lastli the posit stage and
contend that social scienc must be subject to the same law that the
feudal and cathol system wa the conclud phasi of the theolog
state of the social scienc protestant the commenc and the
doctrin of the french revolut the consumm of the
metaphys and that it posit state wa yet to come thi doctrin
harmon well with my exist notion to which it seem to give a
scientif shape i alreadi regard the method of physic scienc as
the proper model for polit but the chief benefit which i deriv
at thi time from the train of thought suggest by the st simonian
and by comt wa that i obtain a clearer concept than ever befor
of the peculiar of an era of transit in opinion and ceas to
mistak the moral and intellectu characterist of such an era for
the normal attribut of human i look forward through the present
ag of loud disput but gener weak convict to a futur which
shall unit the best qualiti of the critic with the best qualiti
of the organ period uncheck liberti of thought unbound freedom
of individu action in all mode not hurt to other but also
convict as to what is right and wrong us and pernici deepli
engraven on the feel by earli educ and gener unanim of
sentiment and so firmli ground in reason and in the true exig
of life that thei shall not like all former and present creed
religi ethic and polit requir to be period thrown off
and replac by other
m comt soon left the st simonian and i lost sight of him and hi
write for a number of year but the st simonian i continu to
cultiv i wa kept au courant of their progress by on of their
most enthusiast discipl m gustav deichthal who about that time
pass a consider interv in england i wa introduc to their
chief bazard and enfantin in 1830 and as long as their public
teach and proselyt continu i read nearli everyth thei
wrote their critic on the common doctrin of liber seem to
me full of import truth and it wa partli by their write that my
ey were open to the veri limit and temporari valu of the old
polit economi which assum privat properti and inherit as
indefeas fact and freedom of product and exchang as the
dernier mot of social improv the scheme gradual unfold by
the st simonian under which the labour and capit of societi would
be manag for the gener account of the commun everi individu
be requir to take a share of labour either as thinker teacher
artist or produc all be class accord to their capac and
remuner accord to their work appear to me a far superior
descript of social to owen their aim seem to me desir and
ration howev their mean might be inefficaci and though i
neither believ in the practic nor in the benefici oper
of their social machineri i felt that the proclam of such an ideal
of human societi could not but tend to give a benefici direct to
the effort of other to bring societi as at present constitut
nearer to some ideal standard i honour them most of all for what thei
have been most cri down forth bold and freedom from prejudic
with which thei treat the subject of the famili the most import of
ani and need more fundament alter than remain to be made in
ani other great social institut but on which scarc ani reform
ha the courag to touch in proclaim the perfect equal of men and
women and an entir new order of thing in regard to their relat
with on anoth the st simonian in common with owen and fourier
have entitl themselv to the grate remembr of futur
gener
in give an account of thi period of my life i have onli specifi
such of my new impress as appear to me both at the time and
sinc to be a kind of turn point mark a definit progress in my
mode of thought but these few select point give a veri insuffici
idea of the quantiti of think which i carri on respect a host of
subject dure these year of transit much of thi it is true
consist in rediscov thing known to all the world which i had
previous disbeliev or disregard but the rediscoveri wa to me a
discoveri give me plenari possess of the truth not as
tradit platitud but fresh from their sourc and it seldom
fail to place them in some new light by which thei were reconcil
with and seem to confirm while thei modifi the truth less
gener known which lai in my earli opinion and in no essenti part
of which i at ani time waver all my new think onli laid the
foundat of these more deepli and strongli while it often remov
misapprehens and confus of idea which had pervert their effect
for exampl dure the later return of my deject the doctrin of
what is call philosoph necess weigh on my exist like an
incubu i felt as if i wa scientif prove to be the helpless
slave of anteced circumst as if my charact and that of all
other had been form for us by agenc beyond our control and wa
wholli out of our own power i often said to myself what a relief it
would be if i could disbeliev the doctrin of the format of
charact by circumst and rememb the wish of fox respect
the doctrin of resist to govern that it might never be
forgotten by king nor rememb by subject i said that it would be
a bless if the doctrin of necess could be believ by all quoad
the charact of other and disbeliev in regard to their own i
ponder painfulli on the subject till gradual i saw light through it
i perceiv that the word necess as a name for the doctrin of
caus and effect appli to human action carri with it a mislead
associ and that thi associ wa the oper forc in the
depress and paralys influenc which i had experienc i saw that
though our charact is form by circumst our own desir can do
much to shape those circumst and that what is realli inspirit
and ennobl in the doctrin of freewil is the convict that we have
real power over the format of our own charact that our will by
influenc some of our circumst can modifi our futur habit or
capabl of will all thi wa entir consist with the
doctrin of circumst or rather wa that doctrin itself properli
understood from that time i drew in my own mind a clear distinct
between the doctrin of circumst and fatal discard
altogeth the mislead word necess the theori which i now for
the first time rightli apprehend ceas altogeth to be
discourag and besid the relief to my spirit i no longer
suffer under the burdenso heavi to on who aim at be a reform
in opinionsof think on doctrin true and the contrari doctrin
moral benefici the train of thought which had extric me from
thi dilemma seem to me in after year fit to render a similar
servic to other and it now form the chapter on liberti and necess
in the conclud book of my system of logic
again in polit though i no longer accept the doctrin of the
essai on govern as a scientif theori though i ceas to
consid repres democraci as an absolut principl and regard
it as a question of time place and circumst though i now look
upon the choic of polit institut as a moral and educ
question more than on of materi interest think that it ought to
be decid mainli by the consider what great improv in life
and cultur stand next in order for the peopl concern as the
condit of their further progress and what institut ar most
like to promot that nevertheless thi chang in the premis of my
polit philosophi did not alter my practic polit creed as to
the requir of my own time and countri i wa as much as ever a
radic and democrat for europ and especi for england i thought
the predomin of the aristocrat class the nobl and the rich in
the english constitut an evil worth ani struggl to get rid of not
on account of tax or ani such compar small inconveni but
as the great demor agenc in the countri demor first
becaus it made the conduct of the govern an exampl of gross public
immor through the predomin of privat over public interest in
the state and the abus of the power of legisl for the advantag
of class secondli and in a still greater degre becaus the respect
of the multitud alwai attach itself princip to that which in
the exist state of societi is the chief passport to power and under
english institut rich hereditari or acquir be the almost
exclus sourc of polit import rich and the sign of
rich were almost the onli thing realli respect and the life of
the peopl wa mainli devot to the pursuit of them i thought that
while the higher and richer class held the power of govern the
instruct and improv of the mass of the peopl were contrari to
the selfinterest of those class becaus tend to render the peopl
more power for throw off the yoke but if the democraci obtain a
larg and perhap the princip share in the govern power it would
becom the interest of the opul class to promot their educ
in order to ward off realli mischiev error and especi those
which would lead to unjust violat of properti on these ground i
wa not onli as ardent as ever for democrat institut but
earnestli hope that owenit st simonian and all other antiproperti
doctrin might spread wide among the poorer class not that i
thought those doctrin true or desir that thei should be act on
but in order that the higher class might be made to see that thei had
more to fear from the poor when uneduc than when educ
in thi frame of mind the french revolut of juli found me it rous
my utmost enthusiasm and gave me as it were a new exist i went
at onc to pari wa introduc to lafayett and laid the groundwork
of the intercours i afterward kept up with sever of the activ
chief of the extrem popular parti after my return i enter warmli
as a writer into the polit discuss of the time which soon
becam still more excit by the come in of lord grei ministri
and the propos of the reform bill for the next few year i wrote
copious in newspap it wa about thi time that fonblanqu who had
for some time written the polit articl in the examin becam
the proprietor and editor of the paper it is not forgotten with what
verv and talent as well as fine wit he carri it on dure the
whole period of lord grei ministri and what import it assum as
the princip repres in the newspap press of radic
opinion the distinguish charact of the paper wa given to it
entir by hi own articl which form at least threefourth of all
the origin write contain in it but of the remain fourth i
contribut dure those year a much larger share than anyon els i
wrote nearli all the articl on french subject includ a weekli
summari of french polit often extend to consider length
togeth with mani lead articl on gener polit commerci and
financi legisl and ani miscellan subject in which i felt
interest and which were suitabl to the paper includ occasion
review of book mere newspap articl on the occurr or
question of the moment gave no opportun for the develop of ani
gener mode of thought but i attempt in the begin of 1831 to
embodi in a seri of articl head the spirit of the ag some of
my new opinion and especi to point out in the charact of the
present ag the anomali and evil characterist of the transit
from a system of opinion which had worn out to anoth onli in process
of be form these articl were i fanci lumber in style and
not live or strike enough to be at ani time accept to
newspap reader but had thei been far more attract still at that
particular moment when great polit chang were impend and
engross all mind these discuss were illtim and miss fire
altogeth the onli effect which i know to have been produc by them
wa that carlyl then live in a seclud part of scotland read them
in hi solitud and sai to himself as he afterward told me here
is a new mystic inquir on come to london that autumn respect
their authorship an inquiri which wa the immedi caus of our
becom person acquaint
i have alreadi mention carlyl earlier write as on of the
channel through which i receiv the influenc which enlarg my earli
narrow creed but i do not think that those write by themselv
would ever have had ani effect on my opinion what truth thei
contain though of the veri kind which i wa alreadi receiv from
other quarter were present in a form and vestur less suit than
ani other to give them access to a mind train as mine had been thei
seem a haze of poetri and german metaphys in which almost the onli
clear thing wa a strong animos to most of the opinion which were
the basi of my mode of thought religi sceptic utilitarian
the doctrin of circumst and the attach ani import to
democraci logic or polit economi instead of my have been taught
anyth in the first instanc by carlyl it wa onli in proport
as i came to see the same truth through media more suit to my mental
constitut that i recognis them in hi write then inde the
wonder power with which he put them forth made a deep impress upon
me and i wa dure a long period on of hi most fervent admir but
the good hi write did me wa not as philosophi to instruct but as
poetri to anim even at the time when our acquaint commenc i
wa not suffici advanc in my new mode of thought to appreci
him fulli a proof of which is that on hi show me the manuscript of
sartor resartu hi best and greatest work which he just then
finish i made littl of it though when it came out about two year
afterward in fraser magazin i read it with enthusiast admir
and the keenest delight i did not seek and cultiv carlyl less on
account of the fundament differ in our philosophi he soon found
out that i wa not anoth mystic and when for the sake of my own
integr i wrote to him a distinct profess of all those of my
opinion which i knew he most dislik he repli that the chief
differ between us wa that i wa as yet conscious noth of a
mystic i do not know at what period he gave up the expect that i
wa destin to becom on but though both hi and my opinion
underw in subsequ year consider chang we never approach
much nearer to each other mode of thought than we were in the first
year of our acquaint i did not howev deem myself a compet
judg of carlyl i felt that he wa a poet and that i wa not that he
wa a man of intuit which i wa not and that as such he not onli
saw mani thing long befor me which i could onli when thei were
point out to me hobbl after and prove but that it wa highli
probabl he could see mani thing which were not visibl to me even
after thei were point out i knew that i could not see round him and
could never be certain that i saw over him and i never presum to
judg him with ani definit until he wa interpret to me by on
greatli the superior of us bothwho wa more a poet than he and more a
thinker than iwhos own mind and natur includ hi and
infinit more
among the person of intellect whom i had known of old the on with
whom i had now most point of agreement wa the elder austin i have
mention that he alwai set himself in opposit to our earli
sectarian and latterli he had like myself come under new
influenc have been appoint professor of jurisprud in the
london univers now univers colleg he had live for some time
at bonn to studi for hi lectur and the influenc of german
literatur and of the german charact and state of societi had made a
veri percept chang in hi view of life hi person disposit
wa much soften he wa less milit and polem hi tast had
begun to turn themselv toward the poetic and contempl he
attach much less import than formerli to outward chang unless
accompani by a better cultiv of the inward natur he had a
strong distast for the gener mean of english life the absenc of
enlarg thought and unselfish desir the low object on which the
faculti of all class of the english ar intent even the kind of
public interest which englishmen care for he held in veri littl
esteem he thought that there wa more practic good govern and
which is true enough infinit more care for the educ and mental
improv of all rank of the peopl under the prussian monarchi
than under the english repres govern and he held with the
french economist that the real secur for good govern is un
peupl clair which is not alwai the fruit of popular institut
and which if it could be had without them would do their work better
than thei though he approv of the reform bill he predict what in
fact occur that it would not produc the great immedi
improv in govern which mani expect from it the men he
said who could do these great thing did not exist in the countri
there were mani point of sympathi between him and me both in the new
opinion he had adopt and in the old on which he retain like me
he never ceas to be a utilitarian and with all hi love for the
german and enjoy of their literatur never becam in the smallest
degre reconcil to the innateprincipl metaphys he cultiv
more and more a kind of german religion a religion of poetri and
feel with littl if anyth of posit dogma while in polit
and here it wa that i most differ with him he acquir an
indiffer border on contempt for the progress of popular
institut though he rejoic in that of social as the most
effectu mean of compel the power class to educ the
peopl and to impress on them the onli real mean of perman
improv their materi condit a limit of their number
neither wa he at thi time fundament oppos to social in
itself as an ultim result of improv he profess great
disrespect for what he call the univers principl of human natur
of the polit economist and insist on the evid which histori
and daili experi afford of the extraordinari pliabil of human
natur a phrase which i have somewher borrow from him nor did he
think it possibl to set ani posit bound to the moral capabl
which might unfold themselv in mankind under an enlighten direct
of social and educ influenc whether he retain all these
opinion to the end of life i know not certainli the mode of think
of hi later year and especi of hi last public were much
more tori in their gener charact than those which he held at
thi time
my father tone of thought and feel i now felt myself at a great
distanc from greater inde than a full and calm explan and
reconsider on both side might have shown to exist in realiti but
my father wa not on with whom calm and full explan on
fundament point of doctrin could be expect at least with on whom
he might consid as in some sort a desert from hi standard
fortun we were almost alwai in strong agreement on the polit
question of the dai which engross a larg part of hi interest and
of hi convers on those matter of opinion on which we differ
we talk littl he knew that the habit of think for myself which
hi mode of educ had foster sometim led me to opinion
differ from hi and he perceiv from time to time that i did not
alwai tell him how differ i expect no good but onli pain to
both of us from discuss our differ and i never express them
but when he gave utter to some opinion or feel repugn to mine
in a manner which would have made it disingenu on my part to
remain silent
it remain to speak of what i wrote dure these year which
independ of my contribut to newspap wa consider in
1830 and 1831 i wrote the five essai sinc publish under the titl of
essai on some unsettl question of polit economi almost as
thei now stand except that in 1833 i partial rewrot the fifth essai
thei were written with no immedi purpos of public and when
some year later i offer them to a publish he declin them thei
were onli print in 1844 after the success of the system of logic i
also resum my specul on thi last subject and puzzl myself
like other befor me with the great paradox of the discoveri of new
truth by gener reason as to the fact there could be no doubt as
littl could it be doubt that all reason is resolv into
syllog and that in everi syllog the conclus is actual
contain and impli in the premis how be so contain and
impli it could be new truth and how the theorem of geometri so
differ in appear from the definit and axiom could be all
contain in these wa a difficulti which no on i thought had
suffici felt and which at all event no on had succeed in
clear up the explan offer by whate and other though thei
might give a temporari satisfact alwai in my mind left a mist
still hang over the subject at last when read a second or third
time the chapter on reason in the second volum of dugald stewart
interrog myself on everi point and follow out as far as i knew
how everi topic of thought which the book suggest i came upon an
idea of hi respect the us of axiom in ratiocin which i did
not rememb to have befor notic but which now in medit on it
seem to me not onli true of axiom but of all gener proposit
whatev and to be the kei of the whole perplex from thi germ grew
the theori of the syllog propound in the second book of the
logic which i immedi fix by write it out and now with
greatli increas hope of be abl to produc a work on logic of some
origin and valu i proceed to write the first book from the
rough and imperfect draft i had alreadi made what i now wrote becam
the basi of that part of the subsequ treatis except that it did
not contain the theori of kind which wa a later addit suggest
by otherwis inextric difficulti which met me in my first attempt
to work out the subject of some of the conclud chapter of the third
book at the point which i had now reach i made a halt which last
five year i had come to the end of my tether i could make noth
satisfactori of induct at thi time i continu to read ani book
which seem to promis light on the subject and appropri as well
as i could the result but for a long time i found noth which
seem to open to me ani veri import vein of medit
in 1832 i wrote sever paper for the first seri of tait
magazin and on for a quarterli period call the jurist which
had been found and for a short time carri on by a set of friend
all lawyer and law reform with sever of whom i wa acquaint
the paper in question is the on on the right and duti of the state

i wrote previou to these there is noth of suffici perman
valu to justifi reprint the paper in the jurist which i still
think a veri complet discuss of the right of the state over

should have done at ani time the doctrin that all endow ar

soon perceiv that she possess in combin the qualiti which in

women have made her emin among the ruler of mankind her
intellectu gift did but minist to a moral charact at onc the
noblest and the best balanc which i have ever met with in life her
unselfish wa not that of a taught system of duti but of a heart
which thoroughli identifi itself with the feel of other and
often went to excess in consider for them by imagin

boundless generos and a loving ever readi to pour itself forth

these qualiti could not but have a most benefici influenc on my
develop though the effect wa onli gradual and mani year elaps
befor her mental progress and mine went forward in the complet
companionship thei at last attain the benefit i receiv wa far
greater than ani which i could hope to give though to her who had at
first reach her opinion by the moral intuit of a charact of
strong feel there wa doubtless help as well as encourag to be
deriv from on who had arriv at mani of the same result by studi

mental activ which convert everyth into knowledg doubtless
drew from me as it did from other sourc mani of it materi what
i ow even intellectu to her is in it detail almost infinit
of it gener charact a few word will give some though a veri
imperfect idea
with those who like all the best and wisest of mankind ar
dissatisfi with human life as it is and whose feel ar wholli

faculti to whatev conclus might result from it ha put me on my
guard against hold or announc these conclus with a degre of
confid which the natur of such specul doe not warrant and
ha kept my mind not onli open to admit but prompt to welcom and eager
to seek even on the question on which i have most medit ani
prospect of clearer percept and better evid i have often
receiv prais which in my own right i onli partial deserv for the
greater practic which is suppos to be found in my write
compar with those of most thinker who have been equal addict to
larg gener the write in which thi qualiti ha been
observ were not the work of on mind but of the fusion of two on
of them as preemin practic in it judgment and percept of
thing present as it wa high and bold in it anticip for a
remot futur at the present period howev thi influenc wa onli
on among mani which were help to shape the charact of my futur
develop and even after it becam i mai truli sai the presid
principl of my mental progress it did not alter the path but onli
made me move forward more boldli and at the same time more
cautious in the same cours the onli actual revolut which ha
ever taken place in my mode of think wa alreadi complet my new
tendenc had to be confirm in some respect moder in other
but the onli substanti chang of opinion that were yet to come
relat to polit and consist on on hand in a greater
approxim so far as regard the ultim prospect of human to
a qualifi social and on the other a shift of my polit
ideal from pure democraci as commonli understood by it partisan to
the modifi form of it which is set forth in my consider on
repres govern
thi last chang which took place veri gradual date it
commenc from my read or rather studi of m de tocquevil
democraci in america which fell into my hand immedi after it
first appear in that remark work the excel of democraci
were point out in a more conclus becaus a more specif manner
than i had ever known them to be even by the most enthusiast
democrat while the specif danger which beset democraci consid
as the govern of the numer major were brought into equal
strong light and subject to a masterli analysi not as reason for
resist what the author consid as an inevit result of human
progress but as indic of the weak point of popular govern
the defenc by which it need to be guard and the correct which
must be ad to it in order that while full plai is given to it
benefici tendenc those which ar of a differ natur mai be
neutral or mitig i wa now well prepar for specul of
thi charact and from thi time onward my own thought move more and
more in the same channel though the consequ modif in my
practic polit creed were spread over mani year as would be shown
by compar my first review of democraci in america written and
publish in 1835 with the on in 1840 reprint in the dissert
and thi last with the consider on repres govern
a collater subject on which also i deriv great benefit from the
studi of tocquevil wa the fundament question of central
the power philosoph analysi which he appli to american and to
french experi led him to attach the utmost import to the
perform of as much of the collect busi of societi as can
safe be so perform by the peopl themselv without ani
intervent of the execut govern either to supersed their
agenc or to dictat the manner of it exercis he view thi
practic polit activ of the individu citizen not onli as on
of the most effectu mean of train the social feel and
practic intellig of the peopl so import in themselv and so
indispens to good govern but also as the specif counteract
to some of the characterist infirm of democraci and a necessari
protect against it degener into the onli despot of which in
the modern world there is real dangerth absolut rule of the head
of the execut over a congreg of isol individu all equal
but all slave there wa inde no immedi peril from thi sourc
on the british side of the channel where ninetenth of the intern
busi which elsewher devolv on the govern wa transact by
agenc independ of it where central wa and is the
subject not onli of ration disapprob but of unreason
prejudic where jealousi of govern interfer wa a blind feel
prevent or resist even the most benefici exert of legisl
author to correct the abus of what pretend to be local
selfgovern but is too often selfish mismanag of local
interest by a job and born local oligarchi but the more
certain the public were to go wrong on the side oppos to
central the greater danger wa there lest philosoph reform
should fall into the contrari error and overlook the mischief of which
thei had been spare the pain experi i wa myself at thi veri
time activ engag in defend import measur such as the
great poor law reform of 1834 against an irrat clamour ground on
the anticentr prejudic and had it not been for the lesson
of tocquevil i do not know that i might not like mani reform
befor me have been hurri into the excess opposit to that which
be the on preval in my own countri it wa gener my busi
to combat as it is i have steer carefulli between the two error
and whether i have or have not drawn the line between them exactli in
the right place i have at least insist with equal emphasi upon the
evil on both side and have made the mean of reconcil the
advantag of both a subject of seriou studi
in the meanwhil had taken place the elect of the first reform
parliament which includ sever of the most notabl of my radic
friend and acquaintancesgrot roebuck buller sir william
molesworth john and edward romilli and sever more besid
warburton strutt and other who were in parliament alreadi those who
thought themselv and were call by their friend the philosoph
radic had now it seem a fair opportun in a more advantag
posit than thei had ever befor occupi for show what wa in
them and i as well as my father found great hope on them these
hope were destin to be disappoint the men were honest and
faith to their opinion as far as vote were concern often in
spite of much discourag when measur were propos flagrantli at
varianc with their principl such as the irish coercion bill or the
canada coercion in 1837 thei came forward manfulli and brave ani
amount of hostil and prejudic rather than desert the right but on
the whole thei did veri littl to promot ani opinion thei had littl
enterpris littl activ thei left the lead of the radic portion
of the hous to the old hand to hume and oconnel a partial
except must be made in favour of on or two of the younger men and
in the case of roebuck it is hi titl to perman remembr that
in the veri first year dure which he sat in parliament he origin
or reorigin after the unsuccess attempt of mr brougham the
parliamentari movement for nation educ and that he wa the first
to commenc and for year carri on almost alon the contest for the
selfgovern of the coloni noth on the whole equal to these
two thing wa done by ani other individu even of those from whom
most wa expect and now on a calm retrospect i can perceiv that
the men were less in fault than we suppos and that we had expect
too much from them thei were in unfavour circumst their lot
wa cast in the ten year of inevit reaction when the reform
excit be over and the few legisl improv which the
public realli call for have been rapidli effect power gravit
back in it natur direct to those who were for keep thing as
thei were when the public mind desir rest and wa less dispos than
at ani other period sinc the peac to let itself be move by attempt
to work up the reform feel into fresh activ in favour of new
thing it would have requir a great polit leader which no on is
to be blame for not be to have effect realli great thing by
parliamentari discuss when the nation wa in thi mood my father and
i had hope that some compet leader might aris some man of
philosoph attain and popular talent who could have put heart
into the mani younger or less distinguish men that would have been
readi to join himcould have made them avail to the extent of
their talent in bring advanc idea befor the publiccould
have us the hous of common as a rostra or a teacher chair for
instruct and impel the public mind and would either have forc
the whig to receiv their measur from him or have taken the lead of
the reform parti out of their hand such a leader there would have
been if my father had been in parliament for want of such a man the
instruct radic sank into a mere ct gauch of the whig parti
with a keen and as i now think an exagger sens of the
possibl which were open to the radic if thei made even ordinari
exert for their opinion i labour from thi time till 1839 both
by person influenc with some of them and by write to put idea
into their head and purpos into their heart i did some good with
charl buller and some with sir william molesworth both of whom did
valuabl servic but were unhappili cut off almost in the begin of
their us on the whole howev my attempt wa vain to have
had a chanc of succeed in it requir a differ posit from
mine it wa a task onli for on who be himself in parliament could
have mix with the radic member in daili consult could himself
have taken the initi and instead of urg other to lead could
have summon them to follow
what i could do by write i did dure the year 1833 i continu
work in the examin with fonblanqu who at that time wa zealou
in keep up the fight for radic against the whig ministri dure
the session of 1834 i wrote comment on pass event of the natur of
newspap articl under the titl note on the newspap in the
monthli repositori a magazin conduct by mr fox well known as a
preacher and polit orat and subsequ as member of parliament
for oldham with whom i had late becom acquaint and for whose sake
chiefli i wrote in hi magazin i contribut sever other articl
to thi period the most consider of which on the theori of
poetri is reprint in the dissert altogeth the write
independ of those in newspap which i publish from 1832 to
1834 amount to a larg volum thi howev includ abstract of
sever of plato dialogu with introductori remark which though
not publish until 1834 had been written sever year earlier and
which i afterward on variou occas found to have been read and
their authorship known by more peopl than were awar of anyth els
which i had written up to that time to complet the tale of my
write at thi period i mai add that in 1833 at the request of
bulwer who wa just then complet hi england and the english a
work at that time greatli in advanc of the public mind i wrote for
him a critic account of bentham philosophi a small part of which
he incorpor in hi text and print the rest with an honour
acknowledg as an appendix in thi along with the favour
a part also of the unfavour side of my estim of bentham
doctrin consid as a complet philosophi wa for the first time
put into print
but an opportun soon offer by which as it seem i might have it
in my power to give more effectu aid and at the same time stimulu
to the philosoph radic parti than i had done hitherto on of the
project occasion talk of between my father and me and some of
the parliamentari and other radic who frequent hi hous wa the
foundat of a period organ of philosoph radic to take the
place which the westminst review had been intend to fill and the
scheme had gone so far as to bring under discuss the pecuniari
contribut which could be look for and the choic of an editor
noth howev came of it for some time but in the summer of 1834
sir william molesworth himself a labori student and a precis and
metaphys thinker capabl of aid the caus by hi pen as well as
by hi purs spontan propos to establish a review provid i
would consent to be the real if i could not be the ostens editor
such a propos wa not to be refus and the review wa found at
first under the titl of the london review and afterward under that
of the london and westminst molesworth have bought the
westminst from it proprietor gener thompson and merg the two
into on in the year between 1834 and 1840 the conduct of thi review
occupi the greater part of my spare time in the begin it did
not as a whole by ani mean repres my opinion i wa under the
necess of conced much to my inevit associ the review
wa establish to be the repres of the philosoph radic
with most of whom i wa now at issu on mani essenti point and among
whom i could not even claim to be the most import individu my
father cooper as a writer we all deem indispens and he
wrote larg in it until prevent by hi last ill the subject of
hi articl and the strength and decis with which hi opinion were
express in them made the review at first deriv it tone and
colour from him much more than from ani of the other writer i could
not exercis editori control over hi articl and i wa sometim
oblig to sacrific to him portion of my own the old westminst
review doctrin but littl modifi thu form the stapl of the
review but i hope by the side of these to introduc other idea and
anoth tone and to obtain for my own shade of opinion a fair
represent along with those of other member of the parti with
thi end chiefli in view i made it on of the peculiar of the work
that everi articl should bear an initi or some other signatur and
be held to express the opinion sole of the individu writer the
editor be onli respons for it be worth publish and not in
conflict with the object for which the review wa set on foot i had
an opportun of put in practic my scheme of concili between
the old and the new philosoph radic by the choic of a subject
for my own first contribut professor sedgwick a man of emin in
a particular walk of natur scienc but who should not have trespass
into philosophi had late publish hi discours on the studi of
cambridg which had as it most promin featur an intemper
assault on analyt psycholog and utilitarian ethic in the form of an
attack on lock and palei thi had excit great indign in my
father and other which i thought it fulli deserv and here i
imagin wa an opportun of at the same time repel an unjust
attack and insert into my defenc of hartleian and utilitarian
a number of the opinion which constitut my view of those subject as
distinguish from that of my old associ in thi i partial
succeed though my relat to my father would have made it pain to
me in ani case and imposs in a review for which he wrote to speak
out my whole mind on the subject at thi time
i am howev inclin to think that my father wa not so much oppos
as he seem to the mode of thought in which i believ myself to
differ from him that he did injustic to hi own opinion by the
unconsci exagger of an intellect emphat polem and
that when think without an adversari in view he wa will to make
room for a great portion of the truth he seem to deni i have
frequent observ that he made larg allow in practic for
consider which seem to have no place in hi theori hi
fragment on mackintosh which he wrote and publish about thi time
although i greatli admir some part of it i read as a whole with more
pain than pleasur yet on read it again long after i found littl
in the opinion it contain but what i think in the main just and i
can even sympath in hi disgust at the verbiag of mackintosh
though hi asper toward it went not onli beyond what wa judici
but beyond what wa even fair on thing which i thought at the time
of good auguri wa the veri favour recept he gave to
tocquevil democraci in america it is true he said and thought
much more about what tocquevil said in favour of democraci than about
what he said of it disadvantag still hi high appreci of a
book which wa at ani rate an exampl of a mode of treat the question
of govern almost the revers of hiswholli induct and analyt
instead of pure ratiocinativegav me great encourag he also
approv of an articl which i publish in the first number follow
the junction of the two review the essai reprint in the dissert
under the titl civil into which i threw mani of my new opinion
and criticis rather emphat the mental and moral tendenc of the
time on ground and in a manner which i certainli had not learnt from him
all specul howev on the possibl futur develop of my
father opinion and on the probabl of perman cooper
between him and me in the promulg of our thought wa doom to be
cut short dure the whole of 1835 hi health had been declin hi
symptom becam unequivoc those of pulmonari consumpt and after
linger to the last stage of debil he di on the 23rd of june
1836 until the last few dai of hi life there wa no appar
abat of intellectu vigour hi interest in all thing and person
that had interest him through life wa undiminish nor did the
approach of death caus the smallest waver as in so strong and firm
a mind it wa imposs that it should in hi convict on the
subject of religion hi princip satisfact after he knew that hi
end wa near seem to be the thought of what he had done to make the
world better than he found it and hi chief regret in not live
longer that he had not had time to do more
hi place is an emin on in the literari and even in the polit
histori of hi countri and it is far from honour to the gener
which ha benefit by hi worth that he is so seldom mention and
compar with men far hi inferior so littl rememb thi is
probabl to be ascrib mainli to two caus in the first place the
thought of him merg too much in the deservedli superior fame of
bentham yet he wa anyth but bentham mere follow or discipl
precis becaus he wa himself on of the most origin thinker of
hi time he wa on of the earliest to appreci and adopt the most
import mass of origin thought which had been produc by the
gener preced him hi mind and bentham were essenti of
differ construct he had not all bentham high qualiti but
neither had bentham all hi it would inde be ridicul to claim
for him the prais of have accomplish for mankind such splendid
servic as bentham he did not revolution or rather creat on
of the great depart of human thought but leav out of the
reckon all that portion of hi labour in which he benefit by what
bentham had done and count onli what he achiev in a provinc in
which bentham had done noth that of analyt psycholog he will be
known to poster as on of the greatest name in that most import
branch of specul on which all the moral and polit scienc
ultim rest and will mark on of the essenti stage in it
progress the other reason which ha made hi fame less than he
deserv is that notwithstand the great number of hi opinion
which partli through hi own effort have now been gener adopt
there wa on the whole a mark opposit between hi spirit and that
of the present time as brutu wa call the last of the roman so wa
he the last of the eighteenth centuri he continu it tone of thought
and sentiment into the nineteenth though not unmodifi nor
unimprov partak neither in the good nor in the bad influenc of
the reaction against the eighteenth centuri which wa the great
characterist of the first half of the nineteenth the eighteenth
centuri wa a great ag an ag of strong and brave men and he wa a
fit companion for it strongest and bravest by hi write and hi
person influenc he wa a great centr of light to hi gener
dure hi later year he wa quit as much the head and leader of the
intellectu radic in england as voltair wa of the philosoph
of franc it is onli on of hi minor merit that he wa the
origin of all sound statesmanship in regard to the subject of hi
largest work india he wrote on no subject which he did not enrich with
valuabl thought and except the element of polit economi a
veri us book when first written but which ha now for some time
finish it work it will be long befor ani of hi book will be
wholli supersed or will ceas to be instruct read to student
of their subject in the power of influenc by mere forc of mind and
charact the convict and purpos of other and in the strenuou
exert of that power to promot freedom and progress he left as far
as my knowledg extend no equal among men and but on among women
though acut sensibl of my own inferior in the qualiti by which
he acquir hi person ascend i had now to try what it might be
possibl for me to accomplish without him and the review wa the
instrument on which i built my chief hope of establish a us
influenc over the liber and democrat section of the public mind
depriv of my father aid i wa also exempt from the restraint and
retic by which that aid had been purchas i did not feel that
there wa ani other radic writer or politician to whom i wa bound to
defer further than consist with my own opinion and have the
complet confid of molesworth i resolv henceforth to give full
scope to my own opinion and mode of thought and to open the review
wide to all writer who were in sympathi with progress as i understood
it even though i should lose by it the support of my former associ
carlyl consequ becam from thi time a frequent writer in the
review sterl soon after an occasion on and though each
individu articl continu to be the express of the privat
sentiment of it writer the gener tone conform in some toler
degre to my opinion for the conduct of the review under and in
conjunct with me i associ with myself a young scotchman of the
name of robertson who had some abil and inform much industri
and an activ scheme head full of devic for make the review
more saleabl and on whose capac in that direct i found a
good deal of hope insomuch that when molesworth in the begin of
1837 becam tire of carri on the review at a loss and desir
of get rid of it he had done hi part honour and at no small
pecuniari cost i veri imprud for my own pecuniari interest and
veri much from relianc on robertson devic determin to continu
it at my own risk until hi plan should have had a fair trial the
devic were good and i never had ani reason to chang my opinion of
them but i do not believ that ani devic would have made a radic
and democrat review defrai it expens includ a paid editor or
subeditor and a liber payment to writer i myself and sever
frequent contributor gave our labour gratuit as we had done for
molesworth but the paid contributor continu to be remuner on the
usual scale of the edinburgh and quarterli review and thi could
not be done from the proce of the sale
in the same year 1837 and in the midst of these occup i resum
the logic i had not touch my pen on the subject for five year
have been stop and brought to a halt on the threshold of induct
i had gradual discov that what wa mainli want to overcom the
difficulti of that branch of the subject wa a comprehens and at
the same time accur view of the whole circl of physic scienc
which i fear it would take me a long cours of studi to acquir sinc
i knew not of ani book or other guid that would spread out befor me
the gener and process of the scienc and i apprehend that i
should have no choic but to extract them for myself as i best could
from the detail happili for me dr whewel earli in thi year
publish hi histori of the induct scienc i read it with
eager and found in it a consider approxim to what i
want much if not most of the philosophi of the work appear open
to object but the materi were there for my own thought to work
upon and the author had given to those materi that first degre of
elabor which so greatli facilit and abridg the subsequ
labour i had now obtain what i had been wait for under the
impuls given me by the thought excit by dr whewel i read again
sir j herschel discours on the studi of natur philosophi and i
wa abl to measur the progress my mind had made by the great help i
now found in thi workthough i had read and even review it sever
year befor with littl profit i now set myself vigor to work out
the subject in thought and in write the time i bestow on thi had
to be stolen from occup more urgent i had just two month to
spare at thi period in the interv of write for the review in
these two month i complet the first draft of about a third the most
difficult third of the book what i had befor written i estim at
anoth third so that onethird remain what i wrote at thi time
consist of the remaind of the doctrin of reason the theori of
train of reason and demonstr scienc and the greater part of
the book on induct when thi wa done i had as it seem to me
unti all the realli hard knot and the complet of the book had
becom onli a question of time have got thu far i had to leav off
in order to write two articl for the next number of the review when
these were written i return to the subject and now for the first
time fell in with comt cour de philosophi posit or rather
with the two volum of it which were all that had at that time been
publish my theori of induct wa substanti complet befor i
knew of comt book and it is perhap well that i came to it by a
differ road from hi sinc the consequ ha been that my treatis
contain what hi certainli doe not a reduct of the induct
process to strict rule and to a scientif test such as the syllog
is for ratiocin comt is alwai precis and profound on the method
of investig but he doe not even attempt ani exact definit of
the condit of proof and hi write show that he never attain a
just concept of them thi howev wa specif the problem
which in treat of induct i had propos to myself nevertheless
i gain much from comt with which to enrich my chapter in the
subsequ rewrit and hi book wa of essenti servic to me in
some of the part which still remain to be thought out as hi
subsequ volum success made their appear i read them with
avid but when he reach the subject of social scienc with
vari feel the fourth volum disappoint me it contain those
of hi opinion on social subject with which i most disagre but the
fifth contain the connect view of histori rekindl all my
enthusiasm which the sixth or conclud volum did not materi
abat in a mere logic point of view the onli lead concept
for which i am indebt to him is that of the invers deduct method
as the on chiefli applic to the complic subject of histori and
statist a process differ from the more common form of the
deduct method in thisthat instead of arriv at it conclus
by gener reason and verifi them by specif experi as is
the natur order in the deduct branch of physic scienc it
obtain it gener by a collat of specif experi and
verifi them by ascertain whether thei ar such as would follow from
known gener principl thi wa an idea entir new to me when i
found it in comt and but for him i might not soon if ever have
arriv at it
i had been long an ardent admir of comt write befor i had ani
commun with himself nor did i ever to the last see him in the
bodi but for some year we were frequent correspond until our
correspond becam controversi and our zeal cool i wa the
first to slacken correspond he wa the first to drop it i found
and he probabl found likewis that i could do no good to hi mind and
that all the good he could do to mine he did by hi book thi would
never have led to discontinu of intercours if the differ
between us had been on matter of simpl doctrin but thei were chiefli
on those point of opinion which blend in both of us with our
strongest feel and determin the entir direct of our
aspir i had fulli agre with him when he maintain that the
mass of mankind includ even their ruler in all the practic
depart of life must from the necess of the case accept most
of their opinion on polit and social matter as thei do on
physic from the author of those who have bestow more studi on
those subject than thei gener have it in their power to do thi
lesson had been strongli impress on me by the earli work of comt to
which i have advert and there wa noth in hi great treatis which
i admir more than hi remark exposit of the benefit which the
nation of modern europ have histor deriv from the separ
dure the middl ag of tempor and spiritu power and the
distinct organ of the latter i agre with him that the moral
and intellectu ascend onc exercis by priest must in time
pass into the hand of philosoph and will natur do so when thei
becom suffici unanim and in other respect worthi to possess
it but when he exagger thi line of thought into a practic
system in which philosoph were to be organ into a kind of
corpor hierarchi invest with almost the same spiritu supremaci
though without ani secular power onc possess by the cathol
church when i found him reli on thi spiritu author as the onli
secur for good govern the sole bulwark against practic
oppress and expect that by it a system of despot in the state
and despot in the famili would be render innocu and benefici
it is not surpris that while as logician we were nearli at on as
sociologist we could travel togeth no further m comt live to
carri out these doctrin to their extremest consequ by plan
in hi last work the systm de politiqu posit the completest
system of spiritu and tempor despot which ever yet eman from
a human brain unless possibl that of ignatiu loyola a system by
which the yoke of gener opinion wield by an organ bodi of
spiritu teacher and ruler would be made suprem over everi action
and as far as is in human possibl everi thought of everi member of
the commun as well in the thing which regard onli himself as in
those which concern the interest of other it is but just to sai that
thi work is a consider improv in mani point of feel over
comt previou write on the same subject but as an access to
social philosophi the onli valu it seem to me to possess consist in
put an end to the notion that no effectu moral author can be
maintain over societi without the aid of religi belief for comt
work recognis no religion except that of human yet it leav an
irresist convict that ani moral belief concur in by the
commun gener mai be brought to bear upon the whole conduct and

alarm to think of the book stand a monument warn to thinker
on societi and polit of what happen when onc men lose sight in

to return to myself the review engross for some time longer
nearli all the time i could devot to authorship or to think with
authorship in view the articl from the london and westminst
review which ar reprint in the dissert ar scarc a
fourth part of those i wrote in the conduct of the review i had two
princip object on wa to free philosoph radic from the
reproach of sectarian bentham i desir while retain the
precis of express the definit of mean the contempt of
declamatori phrase and vagu gener which were so honour
characterist both of bentham and of my father to give a wider basi
and a more free and genial charact to radic specul to show
that there wa a radic philosophi better and more complet than
bentham while recogn and incorpor all of bentham which is
perman valuabl in thi first object i to a certain extent
succeed the other thing i attempt wa to stir up the educ
radic in and out of parliament to exert and induc them to make
themselv what i thought by us the proper mean thei might becom
a power parti capabl of take the govern of the countri or
at least of dictat the term on which thei should share it with the
whig thi attempt wa from the first chimer partli becaus the
time wa unpropiti the reform fervour be in it period of ebb
and the tori influenc powerfulli ralli but still more becaus as
austin so truli said the countri did not contain the men among the
radic in parliament there were sever qualifi to be us member
of an enlighten radic parti but none capabl of form and lead
such a parti the exhort i address to them found no respons
on occas did present itself when there seem to be room for a bold
and success stroke for radic lord durham had left the ministri
by reason as wa thought of their not be suffici liber he
afterward accept from them the task of ascertain and remov the
caus of the canadian rebellion he had shown a disposit to surround
himself at the outset with radic advis on of hi earliest
measur a good measur both in intent and in effect have been
disapprov and revers by the govern at home he had resign hi
post and place himself openli in a posit of quarrel with the
minist here wa a possibl chief for a radic parti in the person
of a man of import who wa hate by the tori and had just been
injur by the whig ani on who had the most elementari notion of
parti tactic must have attempt to make someth of such an
opportun lord durham wa bitterli attack from all side inveigh
against by enemi given up by timid friend while those who would
willingli have defend him did not know what to sai he appear to be
return a defeat and discredit man i had follow the canadian
event from the begin i had been on of the prompter of hi
prompter hi polici wa almost exactli what mine would have been and
i wa in a posit to defend it i wrote and publish a manifesto in
the review in which i took the veri highest ground in hi behalf
claim for him not mere acquitt but prais and honour instantli a
number of other writer took up the tone i believ there wa a portion
of truth in what lord durham soon after with polit exagger said
to methat to thi articl might be ascrib the almost triumphal
recept which he met with on hi arriv in england i believ it to
have been the word in season which at a critic moment doe much to
decid the result the touch which determin whether a stone set in
motion at the top of an emin shall roll down on on side or on the
other all hope connect with lord durham as a politician soon
vanish but with regard to canadian and gener to coloni polici
the caus wa gain lord durham report written by charl buller
partli under the inspir of wakefield began a new era it
recommend extend to complet intern selfgovern were in
full oper in canada within two or three year and have been sinc
extend to nearli all the other coloni of european race which have
ani claim to the charact of import commun and i mai sai that
in successfulli uphold the reput of lord durham and hi advis
at the most import moment i contribut materi to thi result
on other case occur dure my conduct of the review which
similarli illustr the effect of take a prompt initi i
believ that the earli success and reput of carlyl french
revolut were consider acceler by what i wrote about it in
the review immedi on it public and befor the commonplac
critic all whose rule and mode of judgment it set at defianc had
time to preoccupi the public with their disapprov of it i wrote and
publish a review of the book hail it as on of those product
of geniu which ar abov all rule and ar a law to themselv
neither in thi case nor in that of lord durham do i ascrib the
impress which i think wa produc by what i wrote to ani
particular merit of execut inde in at least on of the case the
articl on carlyl i do not think the execut wa good and in both
instanc i am persuad that anybodi in a posit to be read who
had express the same opinion at the same precis time and had made
ani toler statement of the just ground for it would have produc
the same effect but after the complet failur of my hope of put
a new life into radic polit by mean of the review i am glad to
look back on these two instanc of success in an honest attempt to do
mediat servic to thing and person that deserv it after the last
hope of the format of a radic parti had disappear it wa time
for me to stop the heavi expenditur of time and monei which the
review cost me it had to some extent answer my person purpos as
a vehicl for my opinion it had enabl me to express in print much of
my alter mode of thought and to separ myself in a mark manner
from the narrow bentham of my earli write thi wa done by the
gener tone of all i wrote includ variou pure literari articl
but especi by the two paper reprint in the dissert
which attempt a philosoph estim of bentham and of coleridg in
the first of these while do full justic to the merit of bentham i
point out what i thought the error and defici of hi
philosophi the substanc of thi critic i still think perfectli
just but i have sometim doubt whether it wa right to publish it at
that time i have often felt that bentham philosophi as an instrument
of progress ha been to some extent discredit befor it had done it
work and that to lend a hand toward lower it reput wa do
more harm than servic to improv now howev when a
counterreact appear to be set in toward what is good in
bentham i can look with more satisfact on thi critic of it
defect especi as i have myself balanc it by vindic of the
fundament principl of bentham philosophi which ar reprint
along with it in the same collect in the essai on coleridg i
attempt to character the european reaction against the neg
philosophi of the eighteenth centuri and here if the effect onli of
thi on paper were to be consid i might be thought to have er
by give undu promin to the favour side as i had done in the
case of bentham to the unfavour in both case the impetu with
which i had detach myself from what wa unten in the doctrin of
bentham and of the eighteenth centuri mai have carri me though in
appear rather than in realiti too far on the contrari side but as
far as relat to the articl on coleridg my defenc is that i wa
write for radic and liber and it wa my busi to dwell most
on that in writer of a differ school from the knowledg of which
thei might deriv most improv
the number of the review which contain the paper on coleridg wa
the last which wa publish dure my proprietorship in the spring of
1840 i made over the review to mr hickson who had been a frequent
and veri us unpaid contributor under my manag onli stipul
that the chang should be mark by a resumpt of the old name that
of westminst review under that name mr hickson conduct it for
ten year on the plan of divid among contributor onli the net
proce of the review give hi own labour as writer and editor
gratuit under the difficulti in obtain writer which aros
from thi low scale of payment it is highli credit to him that he
wa abl to maintain in some toler degre the charact of the
review as an organ of radic and progress i did not ceas
altogeth to write for the review but continu to send it
occasion contribut not howev exclus for the greater
circul of the edinburgh review induc me from thi time to offer
articl to it also when i had anyth to sai for which it appear to
be a suitabl vehicl and the conclud volum of democraci in
america have just then come out i inaugur myself as a
contributor to the edinburgh by the articl on that work which head
the second volum of the dissert
chapter vii
gener view of the remaind of my life
from thi time what is worth relat of my life will come into a veri
small compass for i have no further mental chang to tell of but
onli as i hope a continu mental progress which doe not admit of a
consecut histori and the result of which if real will be best
found in my write i shall therefor greatli abridg the chronicl
of my subsequ year
the first us i made of the leisur which i gain by disconnect
myself from the review wa to finish the logic in juli and august
1838 i had found an interv in which to execut what wa still undon
of the origin draft of the third book in work out the logic
theori of those law of natur which ar not law of causat nor
corollari from such law i wa led to recogn kind as realiti in
natur and not mere distinct for conveni a light which i had
not obtain when the first book wa written and which made it
necessari for me to modifi and enlarg sever chapter of that book
the book on languag and classif and the chapter on the
classif of fallaci were draft in the autumn of the same
year the remaind of the work in the summer and autumn of 1840 from
april follow to the end of 1841 my spare time wa devot to a
complet rewrit of the book from it commenc it is in thi wai
that all my book have been compos thei were alwai written at least
twice over a first draft of the entir work wa complet to the veri
end of the subject then the whole begun again de novo but
incorpor in the second write all sentenc and part of
sentenc of the old draft which appear as suitabl to my purpos as
anyth which i could write in lieu of them i have found great
advantag in thi system of doubl redact it combin better than
ani other mode of composit the fresh and vigour of the first
concept with the superior precis and complet result from
prolong thought in my own case moreov i have found that the
patienc necessari for a care elabor of the detail of
composit and express cost much less effort after the entir
subject ha been onc gone through and the substanc of all that i find
to sai ha in some manner howev imperfect been got upon paper the
onli thing which i am care in the first draft to make as perfect as
i am abl is the arrang if that is bad the whole thread on which
the idea string themselv becom twist thought place in a wrong
connect ar not expound in a manner that suit the right and a
first draft with thi origin vice is next to useless as a foundat
for the final treatment
dure the rewrit of the logic dr whewel philosophi of the
induct scienc made it appear a circumst fortun for
me as it gave me what i greatli desir a full treatment of the
subject by an antagonist and enabl me to present my idea with
greater clear and emphasi as well as fuller and more vari
develop in defend them against definit object or
confront them distinctli with an opposit theori the controversi
with dr whewel as well as much matter deriv from comt were first
introduc into the book in the cours of the rewrit
at the end of 1841 the book be readi for the press i offer it to
murrai who kept it until too late for public that season and then
refus it for reason which could just as well have been given at
first but i have had no caus to regret a reject which led to my
offer it to mr parker by whom it wa publish in the spring of
1843 my origin expect of success were extrem limit
archbishop whate had inde rehabilit the name of logic and the
studi of the form rule and fallaci of ratiocin and dr
whewel write had begun to excit an interest in the other part of
my subject the theori of induct a treatis howev on a matter so
abstract could not be expect to be popular it could onli be a book
for student and student on such subject were not onli at least in
england few but addict chiefli to the opposit school of
metaphys the ontolog and innat principl school i therefor
did not expect that the book would have mani reader or approv and
look for littl practic effect from it save that of keep the
tradit unbroken of what i thought a better philosophi what hope i
had of excit ani immedi attent were mainli ground on the
polem propens of dr whewel who i thought from observ
of hi conduct in other case would probabl do someth to bring the
book into notic by repli and that promptli to the attack on hi
opinion he did repli but not till 1850 just in time for me to answer
him in the third edit how the book came to have for a work of the
kind so much success and what sort of person compos the bulk of
those who have bought i will not ventur to sai read it i have never
thoroughli understood but taken in conjunct with the mani proof
which have sinc been given of a reviv of specul specul too
of a free kind in mani quarter and abov all where at on time i
should have least expect it in the univers the fact becom
partial intellig i have never indulg the illus that the book
had made ani consider impress on philosoph opinion the
german or a priori view of human knowledg and of the know
faculti is like for some time longer though it mai be hope in a
diminish degre to predomin among those who occupi themselv
with such inquiri both here and on the contin but the system of
logic suppli what wa much want a textbook of the opposit
doctrinethat which deriv all knowledg from experi and all
moral and intellectu qualiti princip from the direct given to
the associ i make as humbl an estim as anybodi of what either
an analysi of logic process or ani possibl canon of evid
can do by themselv toward guid or rectifi the oper of the
understand combin with other requisit i certainli do think them
of great us but whatev mai be the practic valu of a true
philosophi of these matter it is hardli possibl to exagger the
mischief of a fals on the notion that truth extern to the mind
mai be known by intuit or conscious independ of observ
and experi is i am persuad in these time the great
intellectu support of fals doctrin and bad institut by the aid
of thi theori everi inveter belief and everi intens feel of
which the origin is not rememb is enabl to dispens with the
oblig of justifi itself by reason and is erect into it own
allsuffici voucher and justif there never wa such an
instrument devis for consecr all deepseat prejudic and the
chief strength of thi fals philosophi in moral polit and
religion li in the appeal which it is accustom to make to the
evid of mathemat and of the cognat branch of physic scienc
to expel it from these is to drive it from it stronghold and becaus
thi had never been effectu done the intuit school even after
what my father had written in hi analysi of the mind had in
appear and as far as publish write were concern on the
whole the best of the argument in attempt to clear up the real
natur of the evid of mathemat and physic truth the system
of logic met the intuit philosoph on ground on which thei had
previous been deem unassail and gave it own explan from
experi and associ of that peculiar charact of what ar
call necessari truth which is adduc as proof that their evid
must come from a deeper sourc than experi whether thi ha been
done effectu is still sub judic and even then to depriv a
mode of thought so strongli root in human prejudic and partial
of it mere specul support goe but a veri littl wai toward
overcom it but though onli a step it is a quit indispens on
for sinc after all prejudic can onli be successfulli combat by
philosophi no wai can realli be made against it perman until it
ha been shown not to have philosophi on it side
be now releas from ani activ concern in temporari polit and
from ani literari occup involv person commun with

natur to think person when the ag of boyish vaniti is onc past
for limit my own societi to a veri few person gener societi as
now carri on in england is so insipid an affair even to the person
who make it what it is that it is kept up for ani reason rather than
the pleasur it afford all seriou discuss on matter on which

in liveli and sociabl have prevent the cultiv of the
art of talk agreeabl on trifl in which the french of the last
centuri so much excel the sole attract of what is call societi
to those who ar not at the top of the tree is the hope of be aid
to climb a littl higher in it while to those who ar alreadi at the
top it is chiefli a complianc with custom and with the suppos
requir of their station to a person of ani but a veri common
order in thought or feel such societi unless he ha person

a person of high intellect should never go into unintellectu societi
unless he can enter it as an apostl yet he is the onli person with

their superior in knowledg intellect and elev of sentiment
moreov if the charact is form and the mind made up on the few
cardin point of human opinion agreement of convict and feel on
these ha been felt in all time to be an essenti requisit of
anyth worthi the name of friendship in a realli earnest mind all
these circumst unit made the number veri small of those whose
societi and still more whose intimaci i now voluntarili sought
among these by far the princip wa the incompar friend of whom i
have alreadi spoken at thi period she live mostli with on young
daughter in a quiet part of the countri and onli occasion in town
with her first husband mr taylor i visit her equal in both
place and wa greatli indebt to the strength of charact which
enabl her to disregard the fals interpret liabl to be put on
the frequenc of my visit to her while live gener apart from mr
taylor and on our occasion travel togeth though in all other
respect our conduct dure those year gave not the slightest ground
for ani other supposit than the true on that our relat to each
other at that time wa on of strong affect and confidenti intimaci
onli for though we did not consid the ordin of societi bind
on a subject so entir person we did feel bound that our conduct
should be such as in no degre to bring discredit on her husband nor
therefor on herself
in thi third period as it mai be term of my mental progress which
now went hand in hand with her my opinion gain equal in breadth
and depth i understood more thing and those which i had understood
befor i now understood more thoroughli i had now complet turn
back from what there had been of excess in my reaction against
bentham i had at the height of that reaction certainli becom much
more indulg to the common opinion of societi and the world and more
will to be content with second the superfici improv which
had begun to take place in those common opinion than becam on whose
convict on so mani point differ fundament from them i wa
much more inclin than i can now approv to put in abey the more
decidedli heret part of my opinion which i now look upon as almost
the onli on the assert of which tend in ani wai to regener
societi but in addit to thi our opinion were far more heret
than mine had been in the dai of my most extrem bentham in those
dai i had seen littl further than the old school of polit
economist into the possibl of fundament improv in social
arrang privat properti as now understood and inherit
appear to me as to them the dernier mot of legisl and i
look no further than to mitig the inequ consequ on
these institut by get rid of primogenitur and entail the
notion that it wa possibl to go further than thi in remov the
injusticefor injustic it is whether admit of a complet remedi
or notinvolv in the fact that some ar born to rich and the vast
major to poverti i then reckon chimer and onli hope that by
univers educ lead to voluntari restraint on popul the
portion of the poor might be made more toler in short i wa a
democrat but not the least of a socialist we were now much less
democrat than i had been becaus so long as educ continu to be
so wretchedli imperfect we dread the ignor and especi the
selfish and brutal of the mass but our ideal of ultim
improv went far beyond democraci and would class us decidedli
under the gener design of socialist while we repudi with
the greatest energi that tyranni of societi over the individu which
most socialist system ar suppos to involv we yet look forward
to a time when societi will no longer be divid into the idl and the
industri when the rule that thei who do not work shall not eat will
be appli not to pauper onli but imparti to all when the
divis of the produc of labour instead of depend as in so great
a degre it now doe on the accid of birth will be made by concert
on an acknowledg principl of justic and when it will no longer
either be or be thought to be imposs for human be to exert
themselv strenuous in procur benefit which ar not to be
exclus their own but to be share with the societi thei belong to
the social problem of the futur we consid to be how to unit the
greatest individu liberti of action with a common ownership in the
raw materi of the globe and an equal particip of all in the
benefit of combin labour we had not the presumpt to suppos that
we could alreadi forese by what precis form of institut these
object could most effectu be attain or at how near or how
distant a period thei would becom practic we saw clearli that to
render ani such social transform either possibl or desir an
equival chang of charact must take place both in the uncultiv
herd who now compos the labour mass and in the immens major
of their employ both these class must learn by practic to labour
and combin for gener or at all event for public and social
purpos and not as hitherto sole for narrowli interest on but
the capac to do thi ha alwai exist in mankind and is not nor
is ever like to be extinct educ habit and the cultiv of
the sentiment will make a common man dig or weav for hi countri as
readili as fight for hi countri true enough it is onli by slow
degre and a system of cultur prolong through success
gener that men in gener can be brought up to thi point but
the hindranc is not in the essenti constitut of human natur
interest in the common good is at present so weak a motiv in the
gener not becaus it can never be otherwis but becaus the mind
is not accustom to dwell on it as it dwell from morn till night on
thing which tend onli to person advantag when call into activ
as onli selfinterest now is by the daili cours of life and spur
from behind by the love of distinct and the fear of shame it is
capabl of produc even in common men the most strenuou exert
as well as the most heroic sacrific the deeproot selfish which
form the gener charact of the exist state of societi is so
deepli root onli becaus the whole cours of exist institut
tend to foster it and modern institut in some respect more than
ancient sinc the occas on which the individu is call on to do
anyth for the public without receiv it pai ar far less frequent
in modern life than the smaller commonwealth of antiqu these
consider did not make us overlook the folli of prematur attempt
to dispens with the induc of privat interest in social affair
while no substitut for them ha been or can be provid but we
regard all exist institut and social arrang as be in
a phrase i onc heard from austin mere provision and we welcom
with the greatest pleasur and interest all socialist experi by
select individu such as the cooper societi which whether
thei succeed or fail could not but oper as a most us

in the principl of polit economi these opinion were
promulg less clearli and fulli in the first edit rather more so
in the second and quit unequivoc in the third the differ
aros partli from the chang of time the first edit have been
written and sent to press befor the french revolut of 1848 after
which the public mind becam more open to the recept of novelti in
opinion and doctrin appear moder which would have been thought
veri startl a short time befor in the first edit the
difficulti of social were state so strongli that the tone wa on
the whole that of opposit to it in the year or two which follow
much time wa given to the studi of the best socialist writer on the
contin and to medit and discuss on the whole rang of topic
involv in the controversi and the result wa that most of what had
been written on the subject in the first edit wa cancel and
replac by argument and reflect which repres a more advanc
opinion
the polit economi wa far more rapidli execut than the logic
or inde than anyth of import which i had previous written it
wa commenc in the autumn of 1845 and wa readi for the press befor
the end of 1847 in thi period of littl more than two year there wa
an interv of six month dure which the work wa laid asid while i
wa write articl in the morn chronicl which unexpectedli
enter warmli into my purpos urg the format of peasant
properti on the wast land of ireland thi wa dure the period of
the famin the winter of 184647 when the stern necess of the
time seem to afford a chanc of gain attent for what appear to
me the onli mode of combin relief to immedi destitut with
perman improv of the social and econom condit of the
irish peopl but the idea wa new and strang there wa no english
preced for such a proceed and the profound ignor of english
politician and the english public concern all social phenomena not
gener met with in england howev common elsewher made my
endeavour an entir failur instead of a great oper on the wast
land and the convers of cottier into proprietor parliament
pass a poor law for maintain them as pauper and if the nation ha
not sinc found itself in inextric difficulti from the joint
oper of the old evil and the quack remedi it is indebt for it
deliver to that most unexpect and surpris fact the

the rapid success of the polit economi show that the public
want and were prepar for such a book publish earli in 1848 an
edit of a thousand copi wa sold in less than a year anoth
similar edit wa publish in the spring of 1849 and a third of
1250 copi earli in 1852 it wa from the first continu cite
and refer to as an author becaus it wa not a book mere of
abstract scienc but also of applic and treat polit economi
not as a thing by itself but as a fragment of a greater whole a branch
of social philosophi so interlink with all the other branch that
it conclus even in it own peculiar provinc ar onli true
condition subject to interfer and counteract from caus not
directli within it scope while to the charact of a practic guid
it ha no pretens apart from other class of consider
polit economi in truth ha never pretend to give advic to
mankind with no light but it own though peopl who knew noth but
polit economi and therefor knew that ill have taken upon
themselv to advis and could onli do so by such light as thei had
but the numer sentiment enemi of polit economi and it still
more numer interest enemi in sentiment guis have been veri
success in gain belief for thi among other unmerit imput

the differ applic which it suggest other of cours must
judg
for a consider time after thi i publish no work of magnitud
though i still occasion wrote in period and my correspond
much of it with person quit unknown to me on subject of public
interest swell to a consider bulk dure these year i wrote or
commenc variou essai for eventu public on some of the
fundament question of human and social life with regard to sever
of which i have alreadi much exceed the sever of the horatian
precept i continu to watch with keen interest the progress of public
event but it wa not on the whole veri encourag to me the
european reaction after 1848 and the success of an unprincipl usurp
in decemb 1851 put an end as it seem to all present hope for
freedom or social improv in franc and the contin in england i
had seen and continu to see mani of the opinion of my youth obtain
gener recognit and mani of the reform in institut for which
i had through life contend either effect or in cours of be so
but these chang had been attend with much less benefit to human
wellb than i should formerli have anticip becaus thei had
produc veri littl improv in that which all real amelior in
the lot of mankind depend on their intellectu and moral state and
it might even be question if the variou caus of deterior which
had been at work in the meanwhil had not more than counterbalanc the
tendenc to improv i had learnt from experi that mani fals
opinion mai be exchang for true on without in the least alter
the habit of mind of which fals opinion ar the result the english
public for exampl ar quit as raw and undiscern on subject of
polit economi sinc the nation ha been convert to freetrad as
thei were befor and ar still further from have acquir better
habit of thought and feel or be in ani wai better fortifi
against error on subject of a more elev charact for though
thei have thrown off certain error the gener disciplin of their
mind intellectu and moral is not alter i am now convinc
that no great improv in the lot of mankind ar possibl until a
great chang take place in the fundament constitut of their mode
of thought the old opinion in religion moral and polit ar so
much discredit in the more intellectu mind as to have lost the
greater part of their efficaci for good while thei have still life
enough in them to be a power obstacl to the grow up of ani better
opinion on those subject when the philosoph mind of the world can
no longer believ it religion or can onli believ it with
modif amount to an essenti chang of it charact a
transit period commenc of weak convict paralys
intellect and grow laxiti of principl which cannot termin
until a renov ha been effect in the basi of their belief
lead to the evolut of some faith whether religi or
mere human which thei can realli believ and when thing ar in thi
state all think or write which doe not tend to promot such a
renov is of veri littl valu beyond the moment sinc there wa
littl in the appar condit of the public mind indic of ani
tendenc in thi direct my view of the immedi prospect of human
improv wa not sanguin more recent a spirit of free specul
ha sprung up give a more encourag prospect of the gradual mental

auspic of the movement for polit freedom in the rest of europ
ha given to the present condit of human affair a more hope

between the time of which i have now spoken and the present took place
the most import event of my privat life the first of these wa my
marriag in april 1851 to the ladi whose incompar worth had made
her friendship the greatest sourc to me both of happi and of
improv dure mani year in which we never expect to be in ani
closer relat to on anoth ardent as i should have aspir to
thi complet union of our live at ani time in the cours of my
exist at which it had been practic i as much as my wife would
far rather have foregon that privileg for ever than have ow it to
the prematur death of on for whom i had the sincerest respect and she
the strongest affect that event howev have taken place in
juli 1849 it wa grant to me to deriv from that evil my own
greatest good by ad to the partnership of thought feel and
write which had long exist a partnership of our entir exist
for seven and ahalf year that bless wa mine for seven and ahalf
onli i can sai noth which could describ even in the faintest
manner what that loss wa and is but becaus i know that she would
have wish it i endeavour to make the best of what life i have left
and to work on for her purpos with such diminish strength as can be
deriv from thought of her and communion with her memori
when two person have their thought and specul complet in
common when all subject of intellectu or moral interest ar
discuss between them in daili life and probe to much greater depth
than ar usual or conveni sound in write intend for
gener reader when thei set out from the same principl and arriv
at their conclus by process pursu jointli it is of littl
consequ in respect to the question of origin which of them
hold the pen the on who contribut least to the composit mai
contribut more to the thought the write which result ar the joint
product of both and it must often be imposs to disentangl their
respect part and affirm that thi belong to on and that to the
other in thi wide sens not onli dure the year of our marri
life but dure mani of the year of confidenti friendship which
preced all my publish write were as much here work as mine her
share in them constantli increas as year advanc but in certain
case what belong to her can be distinguish and special
identifi over and abov the gener influenc which her mind had over
mine the most valuabl idea and featur in these joint
productionsthos which have been most fruit of import result
and have contribut most to the success and reput of the work
themselvesorigin with her were eman from her mind my part
in them be no greater than in ani of the thought which i found in
previou writer and made my own onli by incorpor them with my own
system of thought dure the greater part of my literari life i have
perform the offic in relat to her which from a rather earli
period i had consid as the most us part that i wa qualifi to
take in the domain of thought that of an interpret of origin
thinker and mediat between them and the public for i had alwai a
humbl opinion of my own power as an origin thinker except in
abstract scienc logic metaphys and the theoret principl of
polit economi and polit but thought myself much superior to
most of my contemporari in willing and abil to learn from
everybodi as i found hardli anyon who made such a point of examin
what wa said in defenc of all opinion howev new or howev old in
the convict that even if thei were error there might be a substratum
of truth underneath them and that in ani case the discoveri of what it
wa that made them plausibl would be a benefit to truth i had in
consequ mark thi out as a sphere of us in which i wa
under a special oblig to make myself activ the more so as the
acquaint i had form with the idea of the coleridgian of the
german thinker and of carlyl all of them fierc oppos to the
mode of thought in which i had been brought up had convinc me that
along with much error thei possess much truth which wa veil from
mind otherwis capabl of receiv it by the transcendent and
mystic phraseolog in which thei were accustom to shut it up and
from which thei neither care nor knew how to disengag it and i did
not despair of separ the truth from the error and expos it in
term which would be intellig and not repuls to those on my own
side in philosophi thu prepar it will easili be believ that when
i came into close intellectu communion with a person of the most
emin faculti whose geniu as it grew and unfold itself in
thought continu struck out truth far in advanc of me but in
which i could not as i had done in those other detect ani mixtur of
error the greatest part of my mental growth consist in the
assimil of those truth and the most valuabl part of my
intellectu work wa in build the bridg and clear the path
which connect them with my gener system of thought4
the first of my book in which her share wa conspici wa the
principl of polit economi the system of logic ow littl to
her except in the minut matter of composit in which respect my
write both great and small have larg benefit by her accur
and clearsight criticism5 the chapter of the polit econonomi
which ha had a greater influenc on opinion than all the rest that on
the probabl futur of the labour class is entir due to her
in the first draft of the book that chapter did not exist she point
out the need of such a chapter and the extrem imperfect of the book
without it she wa the caus of my write it and the more gener
part of the chapter the statement and discuss of the two opposit
theori respect the proper condit of the labour class wa
wholli an exposit of her thought often in word taken from her own
lip the pure scientif part of the polit economi i did not
learn from her but it wa chiefli her influenc that gave to the book
that gener tone by which it is distinguish from all previou
exposit of polit economi that had ani pretens to be
scientif and which ha made it so us in concili mind which
those previou exposit had repel thi tone consist chiefli in
make the proper distinct between the law of the product of
wealthwhich ar law of natur depend on the properti of
objectsand the mode of it distribut which subject to certain
condit depend on human will the commom run of polit economist
confus these togeth under the design of econom law which
thei deem incap of be defeat or modifi by human effort
ascrib the same necess to thing depend on the unchang
condit of our earthli exist and to those which be but the
necessari consequ of particular social arrang ar mere
coextens with these given certain institut and custom wage
profit and rent will be determin by certain caus but thi class
of polit economist drop the indispens presupposit and argu
that these caus must by an inher necess against which no human
mean can avail determin the share which fall in the divis of the
produc to labour capitalist and landlord the principl of
polit economi yield to none of it predecessor in aim at the
scientif appreci of the action of these caus under the
condit which thei presuppos but it set the exampl of not treat
those condit as final the econom gener which depend not
on necessati of natur but on those combin with the exist
arrang of societi it deal with onli as provision and as
liabl to be much alter by the progress of social improv i had
inde partial learnt thi view of thing from the thought awaken
in me by the specul of the st simonian but it wa made a live
principl pervad and anim the book by my wife prompt thi
exampl illustr well the gener charact of what she contribut
to my write what wa abstract and pure scientif wa gener
mine the properli human element came from her in all that concern
the applic of philosophi to the exig of human societi and
progress i wa her pupil alik in bold of specul and
cautious of practic judgment for on the on hand she wa much
more courag and farsight than without her i should have been in
anticip of an order of thing to come in which mani of the limit
gener now so often confound with univers principl will
ceas to be applic those part of my write and especi of
the polit economi which contempl possibl in the futur
such as when affirm by socialist have in gener been fierc
deni by polit economist would but for her either have been
absent or the suggest would have been made much more timidli and in
a more qualifi form but while she thu render me bolder in
specul on human affair her practic turn of mind and her almost
uner estim of practic obstacl repress in me all tendenc
that were realli visionari her mind invest all idea in a concret
shape and form to itself a concept of how thei would actual
work and her knowledg of the exist feel and conduct of mankind
wa so seldom at fault that the weak point in ani unwork suggest
seldom escap her6
dure the two year which immedi preced the cessat of my
offici life my wife and i were work togeth at the liberti
i had first plan and written it as a short essai in 1854 it wa in
mount the step of the capitol in januari 1855 that the thought
first aros of convert it into a volum none of my write have
been either so carefulli compos or so sedul correct as thi
after it had been written as usual twice over we kept it by us
bring it out from time to time and go through it de novo
read weigh and critic everi sentenc it final revis
wa to have been a work of the winter of 18589 the first after my
retir which we had arrang to pass in the south of europ that
hope and everi other were frustrat by the most unexpect and bitter
calam of her deathat avignon on our wai to montpelli from a
sudden attack of pulmonari congest
sinc then i have sought for such allev as my state
admit of by the mode of life which most enabl me to feel her still
near me i bought a cottag as close as possibl to the place where she
is buri and there her daughter my fellowsuffer and now my chief
comfort and i live constantli dure a great portion of the year my
object in life ar sole those which were her my pursuit and
occup those in which she share or sympath and which ar
indissolubl associ with her her memori is to me a religion and
her approb the standard by which sum up as it doe all
worthi i endeavour to regul my life
after my irrepar loss on of my earliest care wa to print and
publish the treatis so much of which wa the work of her whom i had
lost and consecr it to her memori i have made no alter or
addit to it nor shall i ever though it want the last touch of her
hand no substitut for that touch shall ever be attempt by mine
the liberti wa more directli and liter our joint product than
anyth els which bear my name for there wa not a sentenc of it
that wa not sever time gone through by us togeth turn over in
mani wai and carefulli weed of ani fault either in thought or
express that we detect in it it is in consequ of thi that
although it never underw her final revis it far surpass as a
mere specimen of composit anyth which ha proceed from me
either befor or sinc with regard to the thought it is difficult to
identifi ani particular part or element as be more her than all the
rest the whole mode of think of which the book wa the express
wa emphat her but i also wa so thoroughli imbu with it that
the same thought natur occur to us both that i wa thu
penetr with it howev i ow in a great degre to her there wa a
moment in my mental progress when i might easili have fallen into a
tendenc toward overgovern both social and polit as there
wa also a moment when by reaction from a contrari excess i might have
becom a less thorough radic and democrat than i am in both these
point as in mani other she benefit me as much by keep me right
where i wa right as by lead me to new truth and rid me of
error my great readi and eager to learn from everybodi and to
make room in my opinion for everi new acquisit by adjust the old
and the new to on anoth might but for her steadi influenc have
seduc me into modifi my earli opinion too much she wa in noth
more valuabl to my mental develop than by her just measur of the
rel import of differ consider which often protect
me from allow to truth i had onli recent learnt to see a more
import place in my thought than wa properli their due
the liberti is like to surviv longer than anyth els that i have
written with the possibl except of the logic becaus the
conjunct of her mind with mine ha render it a kind of philosoph
textbook of a singl truth which the chang progress take
place in modern societi tend to bring out into ever stronger relief the
import to man and societi of a larg varieti in type of charact
and of give full freedom to human natur to expand itself in
innumer and conflict direct noth can better show how deep
ar the foundat of thi truth than the great impress made by the
exposit of it at a time which to superfici observ did not
seem to stand much in need of such a lesson the fear we express
lest the inevit growth of social equal and of the govern of
public opinion should impos on mankind an oppress yoke of
uniform in opinion and practic might easili have appear
chimer to those who look more at present fact than at tendenc
for the gradual revolut that is take place in societi and
institut ha thu far been decidedli favour to the develop
of new opinion and ha procur for them a much more unprejud
hear than thei previous met with but thi is a featur belong
to period of transit when old notion and feel have been
unsettl and no new doctrin have yet succeed to their ascend
at such time peopl of ani mental activ have given up their old
belief and not feel quit sure that those thei still retain can
stand unmodifi listen eagerli to new opinion but thi state of
thing is necessarili transitori some particular bodi of doctrin in
time ralli the major round it organ social institut and
mode of action conform to itself educ impress thi new
creed upon the new gener without the mental process that have
led to it and by degre it acquir the veri same power of
compress so long exercis by the creed of which it had taken the
place whether thi noxiou power will be exercis depend on whether
mankind have by that time becom awar that it cannot be exercis
without stunt and dwarf human natur it is then that the
teach of the liberti will have their greatest valu and it is to
be fear that thei will retain that valu a long time
as regard origin it ha of cours no other than that which everi
thought mind give to it own mode of conceiv and express
truth which ar common properti the lead thought of the book is on
which though in mani ag confin to insul thinker mankind have
probabl at no time sinc the begin of civil been entir
without to speak onli of the last few gener it is distinctli
contain in the vein of import thought respect educ and
cultur spread through the european mind by the labour and geniu of
pestalozzi the unqualifi championship of it by wilhelm von humboldt
is refer to in the book but he by no mean stood alon in hi own
countri dure the earli part of the present centuri the doctrin of
the right of individu and the claim of the moral natur to
develop itself in it own wai wa push by a whole school of german
author even to exagger and the write of goeth the most
celebr of all german author though not belong to that or to ani
other school ar penetr throughout by view of moral and of
conduct in life often in my opinion not defens but which ar
incessantli seek whatev defenc thei admit of in the theori of the
right and duti of selfdevelop in our own countri befor the book
on liberti wa written the doctrin of individu had been
enthusiast assert in a style of vigor declam sometim
remind on of ficht by mr william maccal in a seri of write
of which the most elabor is entitl element of individu and
a remark american mr warren had frame a system of societi on
the foundat of the sovereignti of the individu had obtain a
number of follow and had actual commenc the format of a
villag commun whether it now exist i know not which though
bear a superfici resembl to some of the project of socialist
is diametr opposit to them in principl sinc it recogn no
author whatev in societi over the individu except to enforc
equal freedom of develop for all individu as the book which
bear my name claim no origin for ani of it doctrin and wa
not intend to write their histori the onli author who had preced me
in their assert of whom i thought it appropri to sai anyth
wa humboldt who furnish the motto to the work although in on
passag i borrow from the warrenit their phrase the sovereignti of
the individu it is hardli necessari here to remark that there ar
abund differ in detail between the concept of the doctrin
by ani of the predecessor i have mention and that set forth in the
book
the polit circumst of the time induc me shortli after to
complet and publish a pamphlet thought on parliamentari reform
part of which had been written some year previous on the occas of
on of the abort reform bill and had at the time been approv and
revis by her it princip featur were hostil to the ballot a
chang of opinion in both of us in which she rather preced me and a
claim of represent for minor not howev at that time go
beyond the cumul vote propos by mr garth marshal in finish
the pamphlet for public with a view to the discuss on the
reform bill of lord derbi and mr disra govern in 1859 i
ad a third featur a plural of vote to be given not to

itself to me as a mean of reconcil the irresist claim of everi
man or woman to be consult and to be allow a voic in the
regul of affair which vital concern them with the superior
of weight justli due to opinion ground on superior of knowledg
the suggest howev wa on which i had never discuss with my
almost infal counsellor and i have no evid that she would have
concur in it as far as i have been abl to observ it ha found
favour with nobodi all who desir ani sort of inequ in the

it wa soon after the public of thought on parliamentari reform
that i becam acquaint with mr hare admir system of person
represent which in it present shape wa then for the first time
publish i saw in thi great practic and philosoph idea the
greatest improv of which the system of repres govern is
suscept an improv which in the most felicit manner
exactli meet and cure the grand and what befor seem the inher
defect of the repres system that of give to a numer
major all power instead of onli a power proport to it number
and enabl the strongest parti to exclud all weaker parti from
make their opinion heard in the assembl of the nation except
through such opportun as mai be given to them by the accident
unequ distribut of opinion in differ local to these great

but mr hare system afford a radic cure thi great discoveri for

inspir all thought person who have adopt it with new and more
sanguin hope respect the prospect of human societi by free the

is manifestli and irresist tend from the chief part of what
seem to qualifi or render doubt it ultim benefit

independ opinion will forc their wai into the council of the nation
and make themselv heard there a thing which often cannot happen in
the exist form of repres democraci and the legislatur
instead of be weed of individu peculiar and entir made up
of men who simpli repres the creed of great polit or religi
parti will compris a larg proport of the most emin individu
mind in the countri place there without refer to parti by
voter who appreci their individu emin i can understand that
person otherwis intellig should for want of suffici
examin be repel from mr hare plan by what thei think the
complex natur of it machineri but ani on who doe not feel the want
which the scheme is intend to suppli ani on who throw it over as a
mere theoret subtleti or crotchet tend to no valuabl purpos
and unworthi of the attent of practic men mai be pronounc an
incompet statesman unequ to the polit of the futur i mean
unless he is a minist or aspir to becom on for we ar quit
accustom to a minist continu to profess unqualifi hostil to
an improv almost to the veri dai when hi conscienc or hi
interest induc him to take it up as a public measur and carri it
had i met with mr hare system befor the public of my pamphlet
i should have given an account of it there not have done so i wrote
an articl in fraser magazin reprint in my miscellan
write princip for that purpos though i includ in it along
with mr hare book a review of two other product on the question
of the dai on of them a pamphlet by my earli friend mr john austin
who had in hi old ag becom an enemi to all further parliamentari
reform the other an abl and vigour though partial erron
work by mr lorim
in the cours of the same summer i fulfil a duti particularli
incumb upon me that of help by an articl in the edinburgh
review to make known mr bain profound treatis on the mind just
then complet by the public of it second volum and i carri
through the press a select of my minor write form the first
two volum of dissert and discuss the select had been
made dure my wife lifetim but the revis in concert with her
with a view to republ had been bare commenc and when i had
no longer the guidanc of her judgment i despair of pursu it
further and republish the paper as thei were with the except of
strike out such passag as were no longer in accord with my
opinion my literari work of the year wa termin with an essai in
fraser magazin afterward republish in the third volum of
dissert and discuss entitl a few word on
nonintervent i wa prompt to write thi paper by a desir while
vindic england from the imput commonli brought against her on
the contin of a peculiar selfish in matter of foreign polici to
warn englishmen of the colour given to thi imput by the low tone
in which english statesmen ar accustom to speak of english polici as
concern onli with english interest and by the conduct of lord
palmerston at that particular time in oppos the suez canal and i
took the opportun of express idea which had long been in my mind
some of them gener by my indian experi and other by the
intern question which then greatli occupi the european
public respect the true principl of intern moral and
the legitim modif made in it by differ of time and
circumst a subject i had alreadi to some extent discuss in the
vindic of the french provision govern of 1848 against the
attack of lord brougham and other which i publish at the time in
the westminst review and which is reprint in the dissert
i had now settl as i believ for the remaind of my exist into
a pure literari life if that can be call literari which continu
to be occupi in a preemin degre with polit and not mere
with theoret but practic polit although a great part of the
year wa spent at a distanc of mani hundr mile from the chief seat
of the polit of my own countri to which and primarili for which i
wrote but in truth the modern facil of commun have not
onli remov all the disadvantag to a polit writer in toler
easi circumst of distanc from the scene of polit action but
have convert them into advantag the immedi and regular receipt
of newspap and period keep him au courant of even the most
temporari polit and give him a much more correct view of the state
and progress of opinion than he could acquir by person contact with
individu for everi on social intercours is more or less limit
to particular set or class whose impress and no other reach him
through that channel and experi ha taught me that those who give
their time to the absorb claim of what is call societi not have
leisur to keep up a larg acquaint with the organ of opinion
remain much more ignor of the gener state either of the public
mind or of the activ and instruct part of it than a reclus who
read the newspap need be there ar no doubt disadvantag in too
long a separ from on countryin not occasion renew
on impress of the light in which men and thing appear when seen
from a posit in the midst of them but the deliber judgment form
at a distanc and undisturb by inequ of perspect is the
most to be depend on even for applic to practic altern
between the two posit i combin the advantag of both and
though the inspir of my best thought wa no longer with me i wa not
alon she had left a daughter my stepdaught miss helen taylor the
inheritor of much of her wisdom and of all her nobl of charact
whose ever grow and ripen talent from that dai to thi have been
devot to the same great purpos and have alreadi made her name
better and more wide known than wa that of her mother though far
less so than i predict that if she live it is destin to becom of
the valu of her direct cooper with me someth will be said
hereaft of what i ow in the wai of instruct to her great power
of origin thought and sound of practic judgment it would be a
vain attempt to give an adequ idea sure no on ever befor wa so
fortun as after such a loss as mine to draw anoth prize in the
lotteri of life anoth companion stimul advis and
instructor of the rarest qualiti whoever either now or hereaft mai
think of me and of the work i have done must never forget that it is
the product not of on intellect and conscienc but of three the
least consider of whom and abov all the least origin is the on
whose name is attach to it
the work of the year 1860 and 1861 consist chiefli of two treatis
onli on of which wa intend for immedi public thi wa the
consider on repres govern a connect exposit of
what by the thought of mani year i had come to regard as the best
form of a popular constitut along with as much of the gener theori
of govern as is necessari to support thi particular portion of it
practic the volum contain mani matur view of the princip
question which occupi the present ag within the provinc of pure
organ institut and rais by anticip some other question
to which grow necess will sooner or later compel the attent
both of theoret and of practic politician the chief of these
last is the distinct between the function of make law for which
a numer popular assembl is radic unfit and that of get good
law made which is it proper duti and cannot be satisfactorili
fulfil by ani other author and the consequ need of a
legisl commiss as a perman part of the constitut of a
free countri consist of a small number of highli train polit
mind on whom when parliament ha determin that a law shall be made
the task of make it should be devolv parliament retain the power
of pass or reject the bill when drawn up but not of alter it
otherwis than by send propos amend to be dealt with by the
commiss the question here rais respect the most import of
all public function that of legisl is a particular case of the
great problem of modern polit organ state i believ for
the first time in it full extent by bentham though in my opinion not
alwai satisfactorili resolv by him the combin of complet
popular control over public affair with the greatest attain
perfect of skill agenc
the other treatis written at thi time is the on which wa publish
some years7 later under the titl of the subject of women it wa
written at my daughter suggest that there might in ani event be
in exist a written exposit of my opinion on that great question
as full and conclus as i could make it the intent wa to keep
thi among other unpublish paper improv it from time to time if i
wa abl and to publish it at the time when it should seem like to be
most us as ultim publish it wa enrich with some
import idea of my daughter and passag of her write but in
what wa of my own composit all that is most strike and profound
belong to my wife come from the fund of thought which had been made
common to us both by our innumer convers and discuss on a
topic which fill so larg a place in our mind
soon after thi time i took from their repositori a portion of the
unpublish paper which i had written dure the last year of our
marri life and shape them with some addit matter into the
littl work entitl utilitarian which wa first publish in
three part in success number of fraser magazin and
afterward reprint in a volum
befor thi howev the state of public affair had becom extrem
critic by the commenc of the american civil war my strongest
feel were engag in thi struggl which i felt from the
begin wa destin to be a turn point for good or evil of the
cours of human affair for an indefinit durat have been a deepli
interest observ of the slaveri quarrel in america dure the mani
year that preced the open breach i knew that it wa in all it
stage an aggress enterpris of the slaveown to extend the
territori of slaveri under the combin influenc of pecuniari
interest domin temper and the fanatic of a class for it
class privileg influenc so fulli and powerfulli depict in the
admir work of my friend professor cairn the slave power their
success if thei succeed would be a victori of the power of evil
which would give courag to the enemi of progress and damp the spirit
of it friend all over the civil world while it would creat a
formid militari power ground on the worst and most antisoci
form of the tyranni of men over men and by destroi for a long time
the prestig of the great democrat republ would give to all the
privileg class of europ a fals confid probabl onli to be
extinguish in blood on the other hand if the spirit of the north wa
suffici rous to carri the war to a success termin and if
that termin did not come too soon and too easili i foresaw from
the law of human natur and the experi of revolut that when
it did come it would in all probabl be thorough that the bulk of
the northern popul whose conscienc had as yet been awaken onli
to the point of resist the further extens of slaveri but whose
fidel to the constitut of the unit state made them disapprov
of ani attempt by the feder govern to interfer with slaveri in

to feel strongli the enorm of slaveri and the inattent habitu
with englishmen to whatev is go on in the world outsid their own
island made them profoundli ignor of all the anteced of the

there were men of high principl and unquestion liber of

of thing last there wa no chanc of a hear for anyth
favour to the american caus and moreov i agre with those who
thought the act unjustifi and such as to requir that england
should demand it disavow when the disavow came and the alarm of
war wa over i wrote in januari 1862 the paper in fraser
magazin entitl the contest in america and i shall alwai feel
grate to my daughter that her urgenc prevail on me to write it
when i did for we were then on the point of set out for a journei
of some month in greec and turkei and but for her i should have
defer write till our return written and publish when it wa
thi paper help to encourag those liber who had felt overborn by
the tide of illiber opinion and to form in favour of the good caus a
nucleu of opinion which increas gradual and after the success of
the north began to seem probabl rapidli when we return from our
journei i wrote a second articl a review of professor cairn book
publish in the westminst review england is pai the penalti in

class stir up in the unit state by their ostentati wish for
the ruin of america as a nation thei have reason to be thank that a
few if onli a few known writer and speaker stand firmli by the
american in the time of their greatest difficulti effect a partial
divers of these bitter feel and made great britain not
altogeth odiou to the american
thi duti have been perform my princip occup for the next
two year wa on subject not polit the public of mr austin
lectur on jurisprud after hi deceas gave me an opportun of
pai a deserv tribut to hi memori and at the same time express
some thought on a subject on which in my old dai of bentham i had
bestow much studi but the chief product of those year wa the
examin of sir william hamilton philosophi hi lectur
publish in 1860 and 1861 i had read toward the end of the latter
year with a halfform intent of give an account of them in a
review but i soon found that thi would be idl and that justic could
not be done to the subject in less than a volum i had then to consid
whether it would be advis that i myself should attempt such a
perform on consider there seem to be strong reason for
do so i wa greatli disappoint with the lectur i read them
certainli with no prejudic against sir william hamilton i had up to
that time defer the studi of hi note to reid on account of their
unfinish state but i had not neglect hi discuss in
philosophi and though i knew that hi gener mode of treat the
fact of mental philosophi differ from that of which i most approv
yet hi vigor polem against the later transcendentalist and hi
strenuou assert of some import principl especi the
rel of human knowledg gave me mani point of sympathi with hi
opinion and made me think that genuin psycholog had consider
more to gain than to lose by hi author and reput hi
lectur and the dissert on reid dispel thi illus and
even the discuss read by the light which these throw on them
lost much of their valu i found that the point of appar agreement
between hi opinion and mine were more verbal than real that the
import philosoph principl which i had thought he recognis
were so explain awai by him as to mean littl or noth or were
continu lost sight of and doctrin entir inconsist with them
were taught in nearli everi part of hi philosoph write my
estim of him wa therefor so far alter that instead of
regard him as occupi a kind of intermedi posit between the
two rival philosophi hold some of the principl of both and
suppli to both power weapon of attack and defenc i now look
upon him as on of the pillar and in thi countri from hi high
philosoph reput the chief pillar of that on of the two which
seem to me to be erron
now the differ between these two school of philosophi that of
intuit and that of experi and associ is not a mere matter
of abstract specul it is full of practic consequ and li
at the foundat of all the greatest differ of practic opinion
in an ag of progress the practic reform ha continu to demand
that chang be made in thing which ar support by power and
widelyspread feel or to question the appar necess and
indefeas of establish fact and it is often an indispens
part of hi argument to show how those power feel had their
origin and how those fact came to seem necessari and indefeas
there is therefor a natur hostil between him and a philosophi
which discourag the explan of feel and moral fact by
circumst and associ and prefer to treat them as ultim
element of human natur a philosophi which is addict to hold up
favourit doctrin as intuit truth and deem intuit to be the
voic of natur and of god speak with an author higher than that
of our reason in particular i have long felt that the prevail
tendenc to regard all the mark distinct of human charact as
innat and in the main indel and to ignor the irresist proof
that by far the greater part of those differ whether between
individu race or sex ar such as not onli might but natur
would be produc by differ in circumst is on of the chief
hindranc to the ration treatment of great social question and on
of the greatest stumbl block to human improv thi tendenc ha
it sourc in the intuit metaphys which character the
reaction of the nineteenth centuri against the eighteenth and it is a
tendenc so agreeabl to human indol as well as to conserv
interest gener that unless attack at the veri root it is sure
to be carri to even a greater length than is realli justifi by the
more moder form of the intuit philosophi that philosophi not
alwai in it moder form had rule the thought of europ for the
greater part of a centuri my father analysi of the mind my own
logic and professor bain great treatis had attempt to
reintroduc a better mode of philosoph latterli with quit as
much success as could be expect but i had for some time felt that the
mere contrast of the two philosophi wa not enough that there ought
to be a handtohand fight between them that controversi as well as
expositori write were need and that the time wa come when such
controversi would be us consid then the write and fame of
sir w hamilton as the great fortress of the intuit philosophi in
thi countri a fortress the more formid from the impos
charact and the in mani respect great person merit and mental
endow of the man i thought it might be a real servic to
philosophi to attempt a thorough examin of all hi most import
doctrin and an estim of hi gener claim to emin as a
philosoph and i wa confirm in thi resolut by observ that in
the write of at least on and him on of the ablest of sir w
hamilton follow hi peculiar doctrin were made the justif
of a view of religion which i hold to be profoundli immoralthat it is
our duti to bow down in worship befor a be whose moral attribut
ar affirm to be unknow by us and to be perhap extrem
differ from those which when we ar speak of our
fellowcreatur we call by the same name
as i advanc in my task the damag to sir w hamilton reput
becam greater than i at first expect through the almost incred
multitud of inconsist which show themselv on compar
differ passag with on anoth it wa my busi howev to
show thing exactli as thei were and i did not flinch from it i
endeavour alwai to treat the philosoph whom i critic with the
most scrupul fair and i knew that he had abund of discipl
and admir to correct me if i ever unintention did him injustic
mani of them accordingli have answer me more or less elabor and
thei have point out oversight and misunderstand though few in
number and mostli veri unimport in substanc such of those as had
to my knowledg been point out befor the public of the latest
edit at present the third have been correct there and the
remaind of the critic have been as far as seem necessari
repli to on the whole the book ha done it work it ha shown the
weak side of sir william hamilton and ha reduc hi too great
philosoph reput within more moder bound and by some of it
discuss as well as by two expositori chapter on the notion of
matter and of mind it ha perhap thrown addit light on some of
the disput question in the domain of psycholog and metaphys
after the complet of the book on hamilton i appli myself to a task
which a varieti of reason seem to render special incumb upon me
that of give an account and form an estim of the doctrin of
august comt i had contribut more than ani on els to make hi
specul known in england and in consequ chiefli of what i had
said of him in my logic he had reader and admir among thought
men on thi side of the channel at a time when hi name had not yet in
franc emerg from obscur so unknown and unappreci wa he at
the time when my logic wa written and publish that to critic
hi weak point might well appear superflu while it wa a duti to
give as much public as on could to the import contribut he
had made to philosoph thought at the time howev at which i have
now arriv thi state of affair had entir chang hi name at
least wa known almost univers and the gener charact of hi
doctrin veri wide he had taken hi place in the estim both of
friend and oppon as on of the conspicu figur in the thought
of the ag the better part of hi specul had made great progress
in work their wai into those mind which by their previou cultur
and tendenc were fit to receiv them under cover of those better
part those of a wors charact greatli develop and ad to in hi
later write had also made some wai have obtain activ and
enthusiast adher some of them of no inconsider person
merit in england franc and other countri these caus not onli
made it desir that some on should undertak the task of sift
what is good from what is bad in m comt specul but seem to
impos on myself in particular a special oblig to make the attempt
thi i accordingli did in two essai publish in success number of
the westminst review and reprint in a small volum under the
titl august comt and positiv
the write which i have now mention togeth with a small number of
paper in period which i have not deem worth preserv were the
whole of the product of my activ as a writer dure the year from
1859 to 1865 in the earli part of the lastment year in
complianc with a wish frequent express to me by work men i
publish cheap peopl edit of those of my write which seem
the most like to find reader among the work class viz
principl of polit economi liberti and repres
govern thi wa a consider sacrific of my pecuniari interest
especi as i resign all idea of deriv profit from the cheap
edit and after ascertain from my publish the lowest price
which thei thought would remuner them on the usual term of an equal
divis of profit i gave up my half share to enabl the price to be
fix still lower to the credit of messr longman thei fix unask
a certain number of year after which the copyright and stereotyp
plate were to revert to me and a certain number of copi after the
sale of which i should receiv half of ani further profit thi number
of copi which in the case of the polit economi wa 10000 ha
for some time been exceed and the peopl edit have begun to
yield me a small but unexpect pecuniari return though veri far from
an equival for the diminut of profit from the librari edit
in thi summari of my outward life i have now arriv at the period at
which my tranquil and retir exist as a writer of book wa to be
exchang for the less congeni occup of a member of the hous of
common the propos made to me earli in 1865 by some elector of
westminst did not present the idea to me for the first time it wa
not even the first offer i had receiv for more than ten year
previou in consequ of my opinion on the irish land question mr
luca and mr duffi in the name of the popular parti in ireland
offer to bring me into parliament for an irish counti which thei
could easili have done but the incompat of a seat in parliament
with the offic i then held in the india hous preclud even
consider of the propos after i had quit the india hous
sever of my friend would gladli have seen me a member of parliament
but there seem no probabl that the idea would ever take ani
practic shape i wa convinc that no numer or influenti portion
of ani elector bodi realli wish to be repres by a person of my
opinion and that on who possess no local connect or popular
and who did not choos to stand as the mere organ of a parti had small
chanc of be elect anywher unless through the expenditur of
monei now it wa and is my fix convict that a candid ought
not to incur on farth of expens for undertak a public duti such
of the law expens of an elect as have no special refer to
ani particular candid ought to be born as a public charg either
by the state or by the local what ha to be done by the support
of each candid in order to bring hi claim properli befor the
constitu should be done by unpaid agenc or by voluntari
subscript if member of the elector bodi or other ar will
to subscrib monei of their own for the purpos of bring by law
mean into parliament some on who thei think would be us there no
on is entitl to object but that the expens or ani part of it
should fall on the candid is fundament wrong becaus it amount
in realiti to bui hi seat even on the most favour supposit
as to the mode in which the monei is expend there is a legitim
suspicion that ani on who give monei for leav to undertak a public
trust ha other than public end to promot by it and a consider
of the greatest import the cost of elect when born by the
candid depriv the nation of the servic as member of
parliament of all who cannot or will not afford to incur a heavi
expens i do not sai that so long as there is scarc a chanc for an
independ candid to come into parliament without compli with
thi viciou practic it must alwai be moral wrong in him to spend
monei provid that no part of it is either directli or indirectli
emploi in corrupt but to justifi it he ought to be veri certain
that he can be of more us to hi countri as a member of parliament than
in ani other mode which is open to him and thi assur in my own
case i did not feel it wa by no mean clear to me that i could do
more to advanc the public object which had a claim on my exert
from the bench of the hous of common than from the simpl posit
of a writer i felt therefor that i ought not to seek elect to
parliament much less to expend ani monei in procur it
but the condit of the question were consider alter when a bodi
of elector sought me out and spontan offer to bring me forward
as their candid if it should appear on explan that thei
persist in thi wish know my opinion and accept the onli
condit on which i could conscienti serv it wa question
whether thi wa not on of those call upon a member of the commun
by hi fellowcitizen which he wa scarc justifi in reject i
therefor put their disposit to the proof by on of the frankest
explan ever tender i should think to an elector bodi by a
candid i wrote in repli to the offer a letter for public
sai that i had no person wish to be a member of parliament that i
thought a candid ought neither to canvass nor to incur ani expens
and that i could not consent to do either i said further that if
elect i could not undertak to give ani of my time and labour to
their local interest with respect to gener polit i told them
without reserv what i thought on a number of import subject on
which thei had ask my opinion and on of these be the suffrag i
made known to them among other thing my convict as i wa bound to
do sinc i intend if elect to act on it that women were
entitl to represent in parliament on the same term with men it
wa the first time doubtless that such a doctrin had ever been
mention to english elector and the fact that i wa elect after
propos it gave the start to the movement which ha sinc becom so
vigor in favour of women suffrag noth at the time appear
more unlik than that a candid if candid i could be call
whose profess and conduct set so complet at defianc all ordinari
notion of election should nevertheless be elect a wellknown
literari man who wa also a man of societi wa heard to sai that the
almighti himself would have no chanc of be elect on such a
programm i strictli adher to it neither spend monei nor
canvass nor did i take ani person part in the elect until
about a week preced the dai of nomin when i attend a few
public meet to state my principl and give to ani question which
the elector might exercis their just right of put to me for their
own guidanc answer as plain and unreserv as my address on on
subject onli my religi opinion i announc from the begin that
i would answer no question a determin which appear to be
complet approv by those who attend the meet my frank on
all other subject on which i wa interrog evid did me far
more good than my answer whatev thei might be did harm among the
proof i receiv of thi on is too remark not to be record in
the pamphlet thought on parliamentari reform i had said rather
bluntli that the work class though differ from those of some
other countri in be asham of ly ar yet gener liar
thi passag some oppon got print in a placard which wa hand to
me at a meet chiefli compos of the work class and i wa
ask whether i had written and publish it i at onc answer i
did scarc were these two word out of my mouth when vehement
applaus resound through the whole meet it wa evid that the
work peopl were so accustom to expect equivoc and evas
from those who sought their suffrag that when thei found instead of
that a direct avow of what wa like to be disagre to them
instead of be affront thei conclud at onc that thi wa a
person whom thei could trust a more strike instanc never came under
my notic of what i believ is the experi of those who best know
the work class that the most essenti of all recommend to
their favour is that of complet straightforward it presenc
outweigh in their mind veri strong object while no amount of
other qualiti will make amend for it appar absenc the first
work man who spoke after the incid i have mention it wa mr
odger said that the work class had no desir not to be told of
their fault thei want friend not flatter and felt under
oblig to ani on who told them anyth in themselv which he
sincer believ to requir amend and to thi the meet
heartili respond
had i been defeat in the elect i should still have had no reason
to regret the contact it had brought me into with larg bodi of my
countrymen which not onli gave me much new experi but enabl me
to scatter my polit opinion rather wide and by make me known
in mani quarter where i had never befor been heard of increas the
number of my reader and the presum influenc of my write these
latter effect were of cours produc in a still greater degre when
as much to my surpris as to that of ani on i wa return to
parliament by a major of some hundr over my conserv
competitor
i wa a member of the hous dure the three session of the parliament
which pass the reform bill dure which time parliament wa
necessarili my main occup except dure the recess i wa a
toler frequent speaker sometim of prepar speech sometim
extemporan but my choic of occas wa not such as i should
have made if my lead object had been parliamentari influenc when i
had gain the ear of the hous which i did by a success speech on
mr gladston reform bill the idea i proceed on wa that when
anyth wa like to be as well done or suffici well done by
other peopl there wa no necess for me to meddl with it as i
therefor in gener reserv myself for work which no other were
like to do a great proport of my appear were on point on
which the bulk of the liber parti even the advanc portion of it
either were of a differ opinion from mine or were compar
indiffer sever of my speech especi on against the motion
for the abolit of capit punish and anoth in favour of
resum the right of seiz enemi good in neutral vessel were
oppos to what then wa and probabl still is regard as the
advanc liber opinion my advocaci of women suffrag and of
person represent were at the time look upon by mani as whim
of my own but the great progress sinc made by those opinion and
especi the respons made from almost all part of the kingdom to the
demand for women suffrag fulli justifi the timeli of those
movement and have made what wa undertaken as a moral and social duti
a person success anoth duti which wa particularli incumb on me
as on of the metropolitan member wa the attempt to obtain a
municip govern for the metropoli but on that subject the
indiffer of the hous of common wa such that i found hardli ani
help or support within it wall on thi subject howev i wa the
organ of an activ and intellig bodi of person outsid with whom
and not with me the scheme origin and who carri on all the
agit on the subject and drew up the bill my part wa to bring in
bill alreadi prepar and to sustain the discuss of them dure the
short time thei were allow to remain befor the hous after have
taken an activ part in the work of a committe presid over by mr
ayrton which sat through the greater part of the session of 1866 to
take evid on the subject the veri differ posit in which the
question now stand 1870 mai justli be attribut to the prepar
which went on dure those year and which produc but littl visibl
effect at the time but all question on which there ar strong privat
interest on on side and onli the public good on the other have a
similar period of incub to go through
the same idea that the us of my be in parliament wa to do work
which other were not abl or not will to do made me think it my
duti to come to the front in defenc of advanc liber on occas
when the obloqui to be encount wa such as most of the advanc
liber in the hous prefer not to incur my first vote in the
hous wa in support of an amend in favour of ireland move by an
irish member and for which onli five english and scotch vote were
given includ my own the other four were mr bright mr mclaren
mr tb potter and mr hadfield and the second speech i delivered9
wa on the bill to prolong the suspens of the habea corpu in
ireland in denounc on thi occas the english mode of govern
ireland i did no more than the gener opinion of england now admit to
have been just but the anger against fenian wa then in all it
fresh ani attack on what fenian attack wa look upon as an
apolog for them and i wa so unfavour receiv by the hous that
more than on of my friend advis me and my own judgment agre with
the advic to wait befor speak again for the favour
opportun that would be given by the first great debat on the reform
bill dure thi silenc mani flatter themselv that i had turn
out a failur and that thei should not be troubl with me ani more
perhap their uncomplimentari comment mai by the forc of reaction
have help to make my speech on the reform bill the success it wa my
posit in the hous wa further improv by a speech in which i
insist on the duti of pai off the nation debt befor our coal
suppli ar exhaust and by an iron repli to some of the tori
leader who had quot against me certain passag of my write and
call me to account for other especi for on in my
consider on repres govern which said that the
conserv parti wa by the law of it composit the stupidest
parti thei gain noth by draw attent to the passag which up
to that time had not excit ani notic but the sobriquet of the
stupid parti stuck to them for a consider time afterward have
now no longer ani apprehens of not be listen to i confin
myself as i have sinc thought too much to occas on which my
servic seem special need and abstain more than enough from
speak on the great parti question with the except of irish
question and those which concern the work class a singl
speech on mr disra reform bill wa nearli all that i contribut
to the great decis debat of the last two of my three session
i have howev much satisfact in look back to the part i took on
the two class of subject just mention with regard to the work
class the chief topic of my speech on mr gladston reform bill wa
the assert of their claim to the suffrag a littl later after the
resign of lord russel ministri and the success of a tori
govern came the attempt of the work class to hold a meet in
hyde park their exclus by the polic and the break down of the
park rail by the crowd though mr beal and the leader of the
work men had retir under protest befor thi took place a scuffl
ensu in which mani innoc person were maltreat by the polic and
the exasper of the work men wa extrem thei show a
determin to make anoth attempt at a meet in the park to which
mani of them would probabl have come arm the govern made
militari prepar to resist the attempt and someth veri seriou
seem impend at thi crisi i realli believ that i wa the mean
of prevent much mischief i had in my place in parliament taken the
side of the work men and strongli censur the conduct of the
govern i wa invit with sever other radic member to a
confer with the lead member of the council of the reform leagu
and the task fell chiefli upon myself of persuad them to give up the
hyde park project and hold their meet elsewher it wa not mr
beal and colonel dickson who need persuad on the contrari it
wa evid that these gentlemen had alreadi exert their influenc in
the same direct thu far without success it wa the work men who
held out and so bent were thei on their origin scheme that i wa
oblig to have recours to le grand moyen i told them that a
proceed which would certainli produc a collis with the militari
could onli be justifi on two condit if the posit of affair
had becom such that a revolut wa desir and if thei thought
themselv abl to accomplish on to thi argument after consider
discuss thei at last yield and i wa abl to inform mr walpol
that their intent wa given up i shall never forget the depth of hi
relief or the warmth of hi express of gratitud after the work
men had conced so much to me i felt bound to compli with their
request that i would attend and speak at their meet at the
agricultur hall the onli meet call by the reform leagu which i
ever attend i had alwai declin be a member of the leagu on
the avow ground that i did not agre in it programm of manhood
suffrag and the ballot from the ballot i dissent entir and i
could not consent to hoist the flag of manhood suffrag even on the
assur that the exclus of women wa not intend to be impli
sinc if on goe beyond what can be immedi carri and profess
to take on stand on a principl on should go the whole length of
the principl i have enter thu particularli into thi matter becaus
my conduct on thi occas gave great displeasur to the tori and
toryliber press who have charg me ever sinc with have shown
myself in the trial of public life intemper and passion i do
not know what thei expect from me but thei had reason to be thank
to me if thei knew from what i had in all probabl preserv them
and i do not believ it could have been done at that particular
junctur by ani on els no other person i believ had at that
moment the necessari influenc for restrain the work class
except mr gladston and mr bright neither of whom wa avail mr
gladston for obviou reason mr bright becaus he wa out of town
when some time later the tori govern brought in a bill to prevent
public meet in the park i not onli spoke strongli in opposit to
it but form on of a number of advanc liber who aid by the
veri late period of the session succeed in defeat the bill by what
is call talk it out it ha not sinc been renew
on irish affair also i felt bound to take a decid part i wa on of
the foremost in the deput of member of parliament who prevail on
lord derbi to spare the life of the condemn fenian insurg gener
burk the church question wa so vigor handl by the leader of
the parti in the session of 1868 as to requir no more from me than an
emphat adhes but the land question wa by no mean in so advanc
a posit the superstit of landlord had up to that time been
littl challeng especi in parliament and the backward state of
the question so far as concern the parliamentari mind wa evidenc
by the extrem mild measur brought in by lord russel govern in
1866 which nevertheless could not be carri on that bill i deliv
on of my most care speech in which i attempt to lai down some
of the principl of the subject in a manner calcul less to
stimul friend than to concili and convinc oppon the
engross subject of parliamentari reform prevent either thi bill
or on of a similar charact brought in by lord derbi govern
from be carri through thei never got beyond the second read
meanwhil the sign of irish disaffect had becom much more decid
the demand for complet separ between the two countri had assum
a menac aspect and there were few who did not feel that if there wa
still ani chanc of reconcil ireland to the british connect it
could onli be by the adopt of much more thorough reform in the
territori and social relat of the countri than had yet been
contempl the time seem to me to have come when it would be us
to speak out my whole mind and the result wa my pamphlet england and
ireland which wa written in the winter of 1867 and publish shortli
befor the commenc of the session of 1868 the lead featur of
the pamphlet were on the on hand an argument to show the
undesir for ireland as well as england of separ between
the countri and on the other a propos for settl the land
question by give to the exist tenant a perman tenur at a
fix rent to be assess after due inquiri by the state
the pamphlet wa not popular except in ireland as i did not expect it
to be but if no measur short of that which i propos would do full
justic to ireland or afford a prospect of concili the mass of the
irish peopl the duti of propos it wa imper while if on the
other hand there wa ani intermedi cours which had a claim to a
trial i well knew that to propos someth which would be call
extrem wa the true wai not to imped but to facilit a more
moder experi it is most improb that a measur conced so
much to the tenantri as mr gladston irish land bill would have been
propos by a govern or could have been carri through parliament
unless the british public had been led to perceiv that a case might be
made and perhap a parti form for a measur consider stronger
it is the charact of the british peopl or at least of the higher and
middl class who pass muster for the british peopl that to induc
them to approv of ani chang it is necessari that thei should look
upon it as a middl cours thei think everi propos extrem and
violent unless thei hear of some other propos go still farther
upon which their antipathi to extrem view mai discharg itself so it
prove in the present instanc my propos wa condemn but ani
scheme for irish land reform short of mine came to be thought moder
by comparison i mai observ that the attack made on my plan usual
gave a veri incorrect idea of it natur it wa usual discuss as a
propos that the state should bui up the land and becom the univers
landlord though in fact it onli offer to each individu landlord
thi as an altern if he like better to sell hi estat than to
retain it on the new condit and i fulli anticip that most
landlord would continu to prefer the posit of landown to that of
govern annuit and would retain their exist relat to their
tenant often on more indulg term than the full rent on which the
compens to be given them by govern would have been base thi
and mani other explan i gave in a speech on ireland in the debat
on mr maguir resolut earli in the session of 1868 a correct
report of thi speech togeth with my speech on mr fortescu bill
ha been publish not by me but with my permiss in ireland
anoth public duti of a most seriou kind it wa my lot to have to
perform both in and out of parliament dure these year a
disturb in jamaica provok in the first instanc by injustic and
exagger by rage and panic into a premedit rebellion had been
the motiv or excus for take hundr of innoc live by militari
violenc or by sentenc of what were call courtsmarti continu
for week after the brief disturb had been put down with mani ad
atroc of destruct of properti log women as well as men and
a gener displai of the brutal reckless which usual prevail when
fire and sword ar let loos the perpetr of those deed were
defend and applaud in england by the same kind of peopl who had so
long upheld negro slaveri and it seem at first as if the british
nation wa about to incur the disgrac of let pass without even a
protest excess of author as revolt as ani of those for which
when perpetr by the instrument of other govern englishmen can
hardli find term suffici to express their abhorr after a short
time howev an indign feel wa rous a voluntari associ
form itself under the name of the jamaica committe to take such
deliber and action as the case might admit of and adhes pour
in from all part of the countri i wa abroad at the time but i sent
in my name to the committe as soon as i heard of it and took an activ
part in the proceed from the time of my return there wa much more
at stake than onli justic to the negro imper as wa that
consider the question wa whether the british depend and
eventu perhap great britain itself were to be under the
govern of law or of militari licenc whether the live and person
of british subject ar at the merci of ani two or three offic
howev raw and inexperienc or reckless and brutal whom a
panicstricken governor or other functionari mai assum the right to
constitut into a socal courtmarti thi question could onli be
decid by an appeal to the tribun and such an appeal the committe
determin to make their determin led to a chang in the
chairmanship of the committe as the chairman mr charl buxton
thought it not unjust inde but inexpedi to prosecut governor
eyr and hi princip subordin in a crimin court but a
numer attend gener meet of the associ have decid
thi point against him mr buxton withdrew from the committe though
continu to work in the caus and i wa quit unexpectedli on my own
part propos and elect chairman it becam in consequ my duti
to repres the committe in the hous of common sometim by put
question to the govern sometim as the recipi of question
more or less provoc address by individu member to myself but
especi as speaker in the import debat origin in the session
of 1866 by mr buxton and the speech i then deliv is that which i
should probabl select as the best of my speech in parliament10 for
more than two year we carri on the combat try everi avenu
legal open to us to the court of crimin justic a bench of
magistr in on of the most tori counti in england dismiss our
case we were more success befor the magistr at bow street
which gave an opportun to the lord chief justic of the queen
bench sir alexand cockburn for deliv hi celebr charg
which settl the law of the question in favour of liberti as far as it
is in the power of a judg charg to settl it there howev our
success end for the old bailei grand juri by throw out our bill
prevent the case from come to trial it wa clear that to bring
english functionari to the bar of a crimin court for abus of power
commit against negro and mulatto wa not a popular proceed
with the english middl class we had howev redeem so far as
lai in us the charact of our countri by show that there wa at
ani rate a bodi of person determin to us all the mean which the law
afford to obtain justic for the injur we had elicit from the
highest crimin judg in the nation an authorit declar that
the law wa what we maintain it to be and we had given an emphat
warn to those who might be tempt to similar guilt hereaft that
though thei might escap the actual sentenc of a crimin tribun
thei were not safe against be put to some troubl and expens in
order to avoid it coloni governor and other person in author
will have a consider motiv to stop short of such extrem in
futur
as a matter of curios i kept some specimen of the abus letter
almost all of them anonym which i receiv while these proceed
were go on thei ar evid of the sympathi felt with the
brutal in jamaica by the brutal part of the popul at home
thei graduat from coars joke verbal and pictori up to threat of
assassin
among other matter of import in which i took an activ part but
which excit littl interest in the public two deserv particular
mention i join with sever other independ liber in defeat
an extradit bill introduc at the veri end of the session of 1866
and by which though surrend avowedli for polit offenc wa not
author polit refuge if charg by a foreign govern with
act which ar necessarili incid to all attempt at insurrect
would have been surrend to be dealt with by the crimin court of
the govern against which thei had rebel thu make the british
govern an accomplic in the vengeanc of foreign despot the
defeat of thi propos led to the appoint of a select committe in
which i wa includ to examin and report on the whole subject of
extradit treati and the result wa that in the extradit act
which pass through parliament after i had ceas to be a member
opportun is given to ani on whose extradit is demand of be
heard befor an english court of justic to prove that the offenc with
which he is charg is realli polit the caus of european freedom
ha thu been save from a seriou misfortun and our own countri from
a great iniqu the other subject to be mention is the fight kept up
by a bodi of advanc liber in the session of 1868 on the briberi
bill of mr disra govern in which i took a veri activ part i
had taken counsel with sever of those who had appli their mind most
carefulli to the detail of the subjectmr wd christi serjeant
pull mr chadwicka well as bestow much thought of my own for
the purpos of frame such amend and addit claus as might
make the bill realli effect against the numer mode of corrupt
direct and indirect which might otherwis as there wa much reason to
fear be increas instead of diminish by the reform act we also
aim at engraft on the bill measur for diminish the
mischiev burden of what ar call the legitim expens of
elect among our mani amend wa that of mr fawcett for make
the return offic expens a charg on the rate instead of on
the candid anoth wa the prohibit of paid canvass and the
limit of paid agent to on for each candid a third wa the
extens of the precaut and penalti against briberi to municip
elect which ar well known to be not onli a preparatori school for
briberi at parliamentari elect but an habitu cover for it the
conserv govern howev when onc thei had carri the lead
provis of their bill for which i vote and spoke the transfer of
the jurisdict in elect from the hous of common to the judg
made a determin resist to all other improv and after on of
our most import propos that of mr fawcett had actual obtain
a major thei summon the strength of their parti and threw out the
claus in a subsequ stage the liber parti in the hous wa greatli
dishonour by the conduct of mani of it member in give no help
whatev to thi attempt to secur the necessari condit of an honest
represent of the peopl with their larg major in the hous
thei could have carri all the amend or better on if thei had
better to propos but it wa late in the session member were eager to
set about their prepar for the impend gener elect and
while some such as sir robert anstruth honour remain at their
post though rival candid were alreadi canvass their constitu
a much greater number place their election interest befor their
public duti mani liber also look with indiffer on legisl
against briberi think that it mere divert public interest from
the ballot which thei consideredveri mistakenli as i expect it will
turn outto be a suffici and the onli remedi from these caus our
fight though kept up with great vigour for sever night wa wholli
unsuccess and the practic which we sought to render more difficult
prevail more wide than ever in the first gener elect held under
the new elector law
in the gener debat on mr disra reform bill my particip
wa limit to the on speech alreadi mention but i made the bill an
occas for bring the two great improv which remain to be made
in repres govern formal befor the hous and the nation
on of them wa person or as it is call with equal proprieti
proport represent i brought thi under the consider of
the hous by an expositori and argument speech on mr hare plan
and subsequ i wa activ in support of the veri imperfect
substitut for that plan which in a small number of constitu
parliament wa induc to adopt thi poor makeshift had scarc ani
recommend except that it wa a partial recognit of the evil
which it did so littl to remedi as such howev it wa attack by
the same fallaci and requir to be defend on the same principl
as a realli good measur and it adopt in a few parliamentari
elect as well as the subsequ introduct of what is call the
cumul vote in the elect for the london school board have had
the good effect of convert the equal claim of all elector to a
proport share in the represent from a subject of mere
specul discuss into a question of practic polit much
sooner than would otherwis have been the case
thi assert of my opinion on person represent cannot be
credit with ani consider or visibl amount of practic result it
wa otherwis with the other motion which i made in the form of an
amend to the reform bill and which wa by far the most import
perhap the onli realli import public servic i perform in the
capac of a member of parliament a motion to strike out the word
which were understood to limit the elector franchis to male and
therebi to admit to the suffrag all women who as household or
otherwis possess the qualif requir of male elector for
women not to make their claim to the suffrag at the time when the
elect franchis wa be larg extend would have been to abjur
the claim altogeth and a movement on the subject wa begun in 1866
when i present a petit for the suffrag sign by a consider
number of distinguish women but it wa as yet uncertain whether the
propos would obtain more than a few strai vote in the hous and
when after a debat in which the speaker on the contrari side were
conspicu by their feebl the vote record in favour of the
motion amount to 73made up by pair and teller to abov 80the
surpris wa gener and the encourag great the greater too
becaus on of those who vote for the motion wa mr bright a fact
which could onli be attribut to the impress made on him by the
debat as he had previous made no secret of hi nonconcurr in the
propos the time appear to my daughter miss helen taylor to have
come for form a societi for the extens of the suffrag to women
the exist of the societi is due to my daughter initi it
constitut wa plan entir by her and she wa the soul of the
movement dure it first year though delic health and
superabund occup made her declin to be a member of the
execut committe mani distinguish member of parliament
professor and other and some of the most emin women of whom the
countri can boast becam member of the societi a larg proport
either directli or indirectli through my daughter influenc she
have written the greater number and all the best of the letter by
which adhes wa obtain even when those letter bore my signatur
in two remark instanc those of miss nightingal and miss mari
carpent the reluct those ladi had at first felt to come
forward for it wa not on their past differ of opinion wa
overcom by appeal written by my daughter though sign by me
associ for the same object were form in variou local centr
manchest edinburgh birmingham bristol and glasgow and other
which have done much valuabl work for the caus all the societi take
the titl of branch of the nation societi for women suffrag but
each ha it own govern bodi and act in complet independ of
the other
i believ i have mention all that is worth rememb of my
proceed in the hous but their enumer even if complet would
give but an inadequ idea of my occup dure that period and
especi of the time taken up by correspond for mani year befor
my elect to parliament i had been continu receiv letter from
stranger mostli address to me as a writer on philosophi and either
propound difficulti or commun thought on subject connect
with logic or polit economi in common i suppos with all who ar
known as polit economist i wa a recipi of all the shallow
theori and absurd propos by which peopl ar perpetu
endeavour to show the wai to univers wealth and happi by some
art reorgan of the currenc when there were sign of
suffici intellig in the writer to make it worth while attempt
to put them right i took the troubl to point out their error until
the growth of my correspond made it necessari to dismiss such
person with veri brief answer mani howev of the commun i
receiv were more worthi of attent than these and in some
oversight of detail were point out in my write which i wa thu
enabl to correct correspond of thi sort natur multipli
with the multipl of the subject on which i wrote especi
those of a metaphys charact but when i becam a member of
parliament i began to receiv letter on privat grievanc and on
everi imagin subject that relat to ani kind of public affair
howev remot from my knowledg or pursuit it wa not my constitu
in westminst who laid thi burthen on me thei kept with remark
fidel to the understand on which i had consent to serv i
receiv inde now and then an applic from some ingenu youth
to procur for him a small govern appoint but these were few
and how simpl and ignor the writer were wa shown by the fact that
the applic came in about equal whichev parti wa in power my
invari answer wa that it wa contrari to the principl on which i
wa elect to ask favour of ani govern but on the whole hardli
ani part of the countri gave me less troubl than my own constitu
the gener mass of correspond howev swell into an oppress
burthen
at thi time and thenceforth a great proport of all my letter
includ mani which found their wai into the newspap were not
written by me but by my daughter at first mere from her willing
to help in dispos of a mass of letter greater than i could get
through without assist but afterward becaus i thought the letter
she wrote superior to mine and more so in proport to the difficulti
and import of the occas even those which i wrote myself were
gener much improv by her as is also the case with all the more
recent of my prepar speech of which and of some of my publish
write not a few passag and those the most success were her
while i remain in parliament my work as an author wa unavoid

in the autumn of 1868 the parliament which pass the reform act wa
dissolv and at the new elect for westminst i wa thrown out not
to my surpris nor i believ to that of my princip support
though in the few dai preced the elect thei had becom more
sanguin than befor that i should not have been elect at all would
not have requir ani explan what excit curios is that i
should have been elect the first time or have been elect then
should have been defeat afterward but the effort made to defeat me
were far greater on the second occas than on the first for on
thing the tori govern wa now struggl for exist and success
in ani contest wa of more import to them then too all person of
tori feel were far more embitt against me individu than on
the previou occas mani who had at first been either favour or
indiffer were vehement oppos to my reelect as i had shown
in my polit write that i wa awar of the weak point in
democrat opinion some conserv it seem had not been without
hope of find me an oppon of democraci as i wa abl to see the
conserv side of the question thei presum that like them i
could not see ani other side yet if thei had realli read my write
thei would have known that after give full weight to all that appear
to me well ground in the argument against democraci i unhesitatingli
decid in it favour while recommend that it should be accompani
by such institut as were consist with it principl and
calcul to ward off it inconveni on of the chief of these
remedi be proport represent on which scarc ani of the
conserv gave me ani support some tori expect appear to have
been found on the approb i had express of plural vote under
certain condit and it ha been surmis that the suggest of thi
sort made in on of the resolut which mr disra introduc into
the hous preparatori to hi reform bill a suggest which meet
with no favour he did not press mai have been occas by what i
had written on the point but if so it wa forgotten that i had made it
an express condit that the privileg of a plural of vote should
be annex to educ not to properti and even so had approv of
it onli on the supposit of univers suffrag how utterli
inadmiss such plural vote would be under the suffrag given by the
present reform act is prove to ani who could otherwis doubt it by
the veri small weight which the work class ar found to possess in
elect even under the law which give no more vote to ani on
elector than to ani other
while i thu wa far more obnoxi to the tori interest and to mani
conserv liber than i had formerli been the cours i pursu in
parliament had by no mean been such as to make liber gener at
all enthusiast in my support it ha alreadi been mention how larg
a proport of my promin appear had been on question on which
i differ from most of the liber parti or about which thei care
littl and how few occas there had been on which the line i took
wa such as could lead them to attach ani great valu to me as an organ
of their opinion i had moreov done thing which had excit in mani
mind a person prejudic against me mani were offend by what thei
call the persecut of mr eyr and still greater offenc wa taken
at my send a subscript to the elect expens of mr bradlaugh
have refus to be at ani expens for my own elect and have had
all it expens defrai by other i felt under a peculiar oblig
to subscrib in my turn where fund were defici for candid whose
elect wa desir i accordingli sent subscript to nearli all
the work class candid and among other to mr bradlaugh he had
the support of the work class have heard him speak i knew him
to be a man of abil and he had prove that he wa the revers of a
demagogu by place himself in strong opposit to the prevail
opinion of the democrat parti on two such import subject as
malthusian and person represent men of thi sort who while
share the democrat feel of the work class judg polit
question for themselv and had courag to assert their individu
convict against popular opposit were need as it seem to me
in parliament and i did not think that mr bradlaugh antireligi
opinion even though he had been intemper in the express of them
ought to exclud him in subscrib howev to hi elect i did
what would have been highli imprud if i had been at liberti to
consid onli the interest of my own reelect and as might be
expect the utmost possibl us both fair and unfair wa made of
thi act of mine to stir up the elector of westminst against me to
these variou caus combin with an unscrupul us of the usual
pecuniari and other influenc on the side of my tori competitor while
none were us on my side it is to be ascrib that i fail at my
second elect after have succeed at the first no sooner wa the
result of the elect known than i receiv three or four invit
to becom a candid for other constitu chiefli counti but
even if success could have been expect and thi without expens i
wa not dispos to deni myself the relief of return to privat life
i had no caus to feel humili at my reject by the elector and
if i had the feel would have been far outweigh by the numer
express of regret which i receiv from all sort of person and
place and in a most mark degre from those member of the liber
parti in parliament with whom i had been accustom to act
sinc that time littl ha occur which there is need to commemor
in thi place i return to my old pursuit and to the enjoy of a
countri life in the south of europ altern twice a year with a
resid of some week or month in the neighbourhood of london i have
written variou articl in period chiefli in my friend mr
morlei fortnightli review have made a small number of speech on
public occas especi at the meet of the women suffrag
societi have publish the subject of women written some year
befor with some addit by my daughter and myself and have
commenc the prepar of matter for futur book of which it will
be time to speak more particularli if i live to finish them here
therefor for the present thi memoir mai close

1in a subsequ stage of boyhood when these exercis had ceas
to be compulsori like most youth writer i wrote tragedi under

4 the step in my mental growth for which i wa indebt to her were
far from be those which a person wholli uninform on the subject
would probabl suspect it might be suppos for instanc that my
strong convict on the complet equal in all legal polit
social and domest relat which ought to exist between men and
women mai have been adopt or learnt from her thi wa so far from
be the fact that those convict were among the earliest result
of the applic of my mind to polit subject and the strength
with which i held them wa as i believ more than anyth els the
origin caus of the interest she felt in me what is true is that
until i knew her the opinion wa in my mind littl more than an
abstract principl i saw no more reason why women should be held in
legal subject to other peopl than why men should i wa certain
that their interest requir fulli as much protect as those of men
and were quit as littl like to obtain it without an equal voic in
make the law by which thei were bound but that percept of the
vast practic bear of women disabl which found express
in the book on the subject of women wa acquir mainli through her
teach but for her rare knowledg of human natur and comprehens
of moral and social influenc though i should doubtless have held my
present opinion i should have had a veri insuffici percept of
the mode in which the consequ of the inferior posit of women
intertwin themselv with all the evil of exist societi and with
all the difficulti of human improv i am inde painfulli
consciou of how much of her best thought on the subject i have fail
to reproduc and how greatli that littl treatis fall short of what
it would have been if she had put on paper her entir mind on thi
