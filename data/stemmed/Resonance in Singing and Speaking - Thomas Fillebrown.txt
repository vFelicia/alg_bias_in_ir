effort to develop my own voic and the voic of my patient after
oper for cleft palat aid by anatom studi result in a
plan for the focus and develop of the human voic quit
differ from ani other yet publish or so far as i know yet
propos thi plan ha prove so success in my later life that i
feel embolden to offer it for the consider of speaker and
singer
while twentyf year ago few of the principl here describ were
acknowledg or even recogn within the last decad almost all
have been advoc separ by differ teacher or writer at
the present time therefor origin consist onli in the
classif of the principl into a systemat progress whole
and in arrang a simpler and more practic method of appli them
thu make the desir result much more quickli attain
it is attempt in thi volum onli to describ the valu of each
element in the product of the perfect tone and to demonstr the
principl which if properli and faithfulli appli will develop the
best that is possibl in each individu voic and prepar the pupil
to enter upon the more advanc art of speak and sing
in 1903 i prepar a seri of paper on the art of vocal which
were publish in the tude in mai june and juli of that year
these articl ar incorpor in thi work in connect with
differ organ and condit import principl ar state and
restat thi repetit is thought desir in order that the
fundament mai be kept promin befor the mind and impress
upon the attent
i believ that a care studi of thi volum will prove of essenti
servic to teacher and advanc pupil of sing and oratori
especi to young teacher just enter upon their duti it
method will be found adapt to the instruct of pupil of all
grade from the kindergarten to the conservatori of music and the

introduct
when a youth it wa my lot to be surround by exampl of faulti
vocal such as prevail in a countri town and to be subject to
the error then in vogu have at the same time small opportun
for train in the applic of principl even as then
imperfectli taught at middl life i had given up all attempt at
sing and had difficulti in speak so as to be heard at ani
consider distanc or for ani consider length of time
profession oblig to my patient howev compel me later
to take up the subject of vocal physiolog thi i did guid by the
idea current on the subject
about 1880 i becam satisfi that mani of the current idea were
incorrect and determin to start anew and to note in detail the
action of each organ us in vocal and articul to thi
end i sought vocal instruct and advic which modifi by my own
observ have produc the most gratifi result
up to that time it had been held that the nasal caviti must be cut
off from the mouth by the close of the soft palat against the back
of the throat that the passag of ever so littl of the sound abov
the palat would give a nasal twang and that the sound wa reinforc
and develop onli in the caviti of the throat and mouth my
practic in oral surgeri coupl with my own vocal studi expos
thi fallaci and reveal to me the true valu of nasal reson
the late mme rudersdorff had begun to recogn the effect of nasal
reson but she left no publish record of her conclus it
doe not appear that she or her contemporari realiz the true valu
of the nasal and head caviti as reinforc agent in the product
of tone or appreci their influenc upon it qualiti and power
there ar perhap few subject on which a greater varieti of opinion
exist than on that of voic cultur and few upon which so mani
volum have been written few point ar uncontest and exactli
opposit statement ar made in regard to each
formerli great stress wa laid upon the distinct between head
tone and chest tone close tone and open tone the whole
music world wa in bondag to regist of the voic and the on
great task confront the singer and vocal teacher wa to blend the
regist a feat still baffl the effort of mani instructor
mani teacher and singer have now reach what thei consid a
demonstr conclus that regist ar not a natur featur of
the voic yet a larg conting still adher to the doctrin of
regist depend for their justif upon the unreli
evid furnish by the laryngoscop not realiz that there will
be found in the littl len as mani differ condit as the
observ have ey to see garcia himself the inventor of the
laryngoscop soon modifi hi first claim as to it valu in vocal
cultur
on thi point we have the testimoni of hi biograph ms mckinlei
as far as garcia wa concern the laryngoscop ceas to be of ani
special us as soon as hi first investig were conclud by hi
examin of the glotti he had the satisfact of prove that all
hi theori with regard to the emiss of the voic were absolut
correct beyond that he did not see that anyth further wa to be
gain except to satisfi the curios of those who might be
interest in see for themselv the form and chang which the
insid of the larynx assum dure sing and speak
of similar purport is the word of the emin bariton sir charl
santlei who in hi art of sing sai
manuel garcia is held up as the pioneer of scientif teach of
sing he wasbut he taught sing not surgeri i wa a pupil of
hi in 1858 and a friend of hi while he lived1 and in all the
convers i had with him i never heard him sai a word about larynx
or pharynx glotti or ani other organ us in the product and
emiss of the voic he wa perfectli acquaint with their
function but he us hi knowledg for hi own direct not to
parad it befor hi pupil

the emin london surgeon and voic specialist dr morel mackenzi
sai of the laryngoscop it can scarc be said to have thrown ani
new light on the mechan of the voic and dr lennox brown
confess that valuabl as ha been the laryngoscop in a
physiolog as undoubtedli it is in a medic sens it ha been
the mean of make all theori of voic product too depend on
the vocal cord and thu the import of the other part of the
vocal apparatu ha been overlook
not onli in regard to regist but in regard to reson focu
articul and the offic and us of the variou vocal organ
similar antagonist opinion exist out of thi chao must some time
come a demonstr system
a gener ago the art of breath wa begin to be more an
object of studi but the true valu of correct later abdomin
breath wa by no mean gener admit or appreci it wa
still taught that the larynx voicebox should bob up and down like a
jackinabox with each chang of pitch and that femal breath
must be perform with a pump action of the chest and the
elev and depress of the collar bone
fortun teacher and singer recogn a good tone when thei
heard it and mani taught much better than thei knew so that the
public did not have to wait for the develop of accur knowledg
of the subject befor hear excel sing and speak yet mani
singer had their voic ruin in the train and their success as
vocalist made imposs while other a littl less unfortun
were still handicap through life by the injuri done by mistaken
method in earli year jenni lind perfect vocal organ were quit
disabl at twelv year of ag by wrong method and thei recov

the whole matter of voic train ha been cloud by controversi
the strident advoc of variou system each of them the onli true
method have in their disput overcast the subject with much that is
irrelev thu obscur it essenti simplic
the scientif teacher at on extrem have paid too exclus
attent to the mechan of the voic the empiricist have gone
to the other extrem in leav out of account fundament fact in
acoust physiolog and psycholog
the truth is that no pure human function especi on so subtl
as sing can be develop mechan nor on the other hand can
the mere ips dixit of ani teacher satisfi the demand of the modern
spirit
principl advoc
the posit here advoc becaus thei seem both ration and
simpl ar
1 that the sing and speak tone ar ident produc by the
same organ in the same wai and develop by the same train
2 that breath is for the singer onli an amplif of the

3 that regist ar a myth

5 that reson determin the qualiti and carri power of everi

the vocal instrument
sinc the vocal organ first becam an object of systemat studi
discuss ha been constant as to whether the human vocal instrument
is a string instrument a reed instrument or a whistl discuss
of the question seem futil for practic it is all of these and
more the human vocal organ form an instrument sui generi which
cannot be compar with ani other on thing not onli is it far more
complex than ani other instrument be capabl as it is of
imit nearli everi instrument in the catalogu and almost everi
sound in natur but it is incompar more beauti an instrument
so univers superior to ani made by man that comparison and
definit fail
element
the human vocal instrument ha the three element common to all
music instrumentsa motor a vibrat and a reson to which
is addedwhat all other instrument lackan articul
1 the respiratori muscl and lung for a motor
2 the vocal cord for a vibrat
3 the throat mouth and the nasal and head caviti for a reson
4 the tongu lip teeth and palat for an articul
these element appear in as great a varieti of size and proport as
do the variat of individu human and each element is
moreov variabl accord to the will or feel of the individu
thi suscept to chang constitut a modifi power which
give a varieti in tone qualiti possibl to no other instrument and
make it our wonder and admir the modif and interact
of these variou part produc by the emot of the singer or
speaker give qualiti of tone express of the feel as of pain
or pleasur grief or joi courag or fear

that the reader mai better understand the proport and relat of
the differ part of the vocal apparatu a section draw of the
head is here produc show the natur posit of the vocal
organ at rest as the draw repres but a vertic section of
the head the reader should note that the sinus like the ey and
nostril lie in pair to the right and left of the centr of the
face the locat of the maxillari sinus within the maxillari or
cheek bone cannot be shown in thi draw
the dark shade repres the caviti of the throat nose and
head the relat of the part ar shown more accur than is
possibl in ani diagram it will be notic that the vibrat from
the larynx would pass directli behind the soft palat into the nasal
chamber and veri directli into the mouth the nasal roof is form by
two bone situat between the ey the sphenoid or wedgebon which
is connect with all other bone of the head and the ethmoid or
sievelik bone the structur of these two bone especi of the
ethmoid consist of veri thin plate or lamin form a mass of air
caviti which commun by small open with the nasal caviti
below thu the vibrat in the nose ar transmit to the air
space abov and the effect qualiti of the head vibrat ar
ad to the tone
the larynx
the larynx or voicebox contain the vocal cord just abov the vocal
cord on each side is a larg deep caviti call the ventricl
these caviti reinforc the primari vibrat set up by the cord
and serv to increas their intens as thei ar project from the
larynx the larynx is the vibrat organ of the voic it is situat
at the base of the tongu and is so close connect with it by
attach to the hyoid bone to which the tongu is also attach
that it is capabl of onli slight movement independ of that organ
consequ it must move with the tongu in articul the
interior muscl of the larynx vari the posit of it wall thu
regul the proxim and tension of the vocal cord the male
larynx is the larger and show the adam appl in both sex the
larynx of the low voic alto or bass is larger than that of the high
voic soprano or tenor the larynx and tongu should not rise with
the pitch of the voic but drop natur with the lower jaw as the
mouth open in ascend the scale the proper posit of the tongu
will insur a proper posit for the larynx the less attent the
larynx receiv the better
the vocal cord
the vocal cord ar neither cord nor band but instead ar thick
portion of membran extend across the inner surfac of the larynx
on account of familiar the name vocal cord will still be us
thei ar fairli well repres by the lip of the cornet player when
place on the mouthpiec of the instrument the pitch of the tone is
fix by the tension of the vocal cord and the width and length of
the open between them their tension and proxim ar
selfadjust to produc the proper pitch without ani consciou
volit of the singer thei can have no special train need
onli to be left alon the work of the vocal cord though essenti
import is when natur perform light and consequ not
exhaust if the larynx and all of it support muscl ar
relax as thei ar in free and easi breath then when the air
pass out through the larynx the vocal cord will automat
assum a tension suffici to vocal the breath and give the note
the proper pitch the normal action of the cord will never caus
hoars or discomfort the sound should seem to be form not in
the throatthu involv the vocal cordsbut in the reson
chamber
the epiglotti
the epiglotti is the valv which close over the upper open of the
larynx it not onli close the mouth of the larynx when food is
swallow but aid materi in convert into tone the vibrat
set up by the vocal cord
the pharynx
the pharynx extend from the larynx to the nasal caviti the size of
the open into the nasal chamber is control by the soft palat
and is frequent entir close the size of the pharynx is vari
by the contract and relax of the circular muscl in it
tissu when swallow it wall ar in contact the pharynx act as
doe the expand tube of brass instrument it increas the forc
and depth of the tone wave the wider the pharynx is open without
constraint the fuller the reson and the better the tone
the under jaw
the under jaw furnish attach for the muscl of the tongu and
hyoid or tongu bone it also control ow to the connect of
the larynx with the hyoid bone the muscl that fix the posit of
the larynx
the pterygoid muscl which move the under jaw forward and backward
do not connect with the larynx so their action doe not compress that
organ or in ani wai imped the action of the vocal apparatu a
relax under jaw allow freer action of the vocal cord and ampler
reson the under jaw should drop littl by littl as the voic
ascend the scale thu open the mouth slightli wider with each
rise in the pitch of the tone in ascend the scale it is well to
open the throat a littl wider as you ascend the deliveri will be
much easier and the tone produc will be much better at the highest
pitch of the voic the mouth should open to it full width at the
same time care must be taken not to draw the corner of the mouth
back as in smile becaus thi lessen the reson of the tone
and give it a flat sound
the under jaw must have consider latitud of motion in
pronunci but by all mean avoid chew of the word and cut
off word by close the jaw instead of finish them by the us of
the proper articul organ which ar the tongu and lip
the soft palat
writer on the voic have almost univers claim that the
princip offic of the soft palat is to shut off the nasal and head
caviti from the throat and to forc the column of vibrat out
through the mouth thu allow none or at most a veri small part
to pass into the nasal passag
thi content impli that the vibrat ar impart to the upper
caviti if at all through the wall of the palat itself and not
through an open behind the palat thi is entir at varianc
with the fact as verifi by my own experi and observ and
the observ of other who ar expert specialist the true offic
of the soft palat is to modifi the open into the nose and thu
attun the reson caviti to the pitch and timbr of the note given
by the vocal cord and pharynx to develop the vowel sound the soft
palat should be drawn forward allow a free passag into the nose
it should be close onli to form the conson which requir a
forcibl expuls of breath from the mouth
the uvula the pendul tip of the soft palat serv as a valv to
more accur adjust the open behind the soft palat to the pitch
of the voic in produc a low tone the soft palat is relax and
hang low down and far forward as the voic ascend the scale the
tension of the soft palat is increas and it is elev and the
uvula shorten thu decreas the open behind the palat but
never close it in fact the larger the open that can be
maintain the broader and better the tone the author wa himself
unabl fulli to appreci thi until he had becom abl to sens the
posit of the soft palat dure vocal
the hard palat and teeth
the hard palat and upper teeth form in part the wall of the mouth
as thei ar solid fixtur noth can be done in the wai of
train thei furnish a point of imping in articul and
plai their part in sympathet reson
the bone which form the roof of the mouth serv also for the floor of
the nasal caviti
the under teeth also serv as wall of resist to support the
tongu dure the perform of it function
the nasal and head caviti
the nasal and head caviti ar reson chamber incap of
special train but their form size and the us made of them have
a wonder effect upon the reson of the voic if the vibrat
ar strong here all other part will vibrat in harmoni action
when respond to the perfectli focus tone the thin wall of the
caviti and the contain air vibrat with surpris forc often
for the moment blind the singer when sound a note intens
have in my surgic work demonstr the exist of a hitherto
unrecogn connect passag or canal between the air caviti of
the face and those of the forehead2 the plai of reson in the
caviti abov the nostril is more easili understood the function of
the caviti known as the frontal sinus see fig 1 ha long been
a mysteri but now that their direct connect with the lower
caviti is proven and the great signific of reson is also
begin to be recogn the mysteri disappear the same mai be
said of the other sinusesethmoid sphenoid and maxillari
and their interconnect
footnot 2 dr fillebrown paper a studi of the relat of the
frontal sinu to the antrum wa read befor the american dental
associ at saratoga august 5 1895 hi investig show
that the funnelshap passag known as the infundibulum extend
from the frontal sinu directli into the antrum or maxillari
sinu thi wa afterward confirm by dr wh cryer and other
influenc of the reson caviti on the pitch of the tone
in instrument chang in the length and form of the reson
chamber affect the pitch as well as the qualiti of the tone thi is
demonstr in the trombon french horn and other wind instrument
the lengthen of the tube of the trombon lower the pitch of the
tone and the project of the hand of the perform into the bell of
the french horn ha the effect of rais the pitch of the sound if
the variat in length or form is onli slight the result is sharp or
flat and the instrument is out of tune in the human instrument all
the organ act togeth as a unit so the fact that the caviti alon
mai affect the pitch is practic of no great signific
the tongu
the tongu and the lip ar the articul organ and the former
ha an import part to plai in alter through it movement the
shape of the mouth caviti
the tip of the tongu should habitu rest against the under front
teeth the tip of the tongu howev must frequent touch the roof
of the mouth near the upper front teeth as when pronounc the
conson c d g or j l n s and t the back part
of the tongu must rise a littl to close against the soft palat when
pronounc g hard and k and hard c q and x the soft
palat come down so far to meet the tongu that the elev of the
latter need be but veri slight
when speak the demand is not so imper but when sing the
bodi of the tongu should lie as flat as possibl so as to enlarg
the mouth especi when give the vowel sound
if the tongu is sometim dispos to be unruli it is the result of
rigid or misplac effort in the surround part thi tendenc
will onli be aggrav by artifici restraint of ani kind the true
wai is to dismiss tongu conscious let go and a normal
flexibl will easili manifest itself
the lip
the lip equal with the tongu ar organ of articul the
upper lip is the princip factor of the two the under lip seem to
follow the lead of the upper the lip need much train and it can
readili be given them while practis to educ the lip both lip
should be project forward and upward at the same time pronounc
the word too bring the edg of the upper lip as high toward the
nose as possibl in practic thi will bring the corner of the mouth
forward and lift the lip clear and free from the teeth and thu add
on more reson caviti thi posit of the lip also give
freedom for pronunci the upper lip plai the most activ part
in the shape of the vowel it should never be drawn against the
teeth when produc vowel tone inde there should be often a
littl space between the upper lip and the teeth so that the
vibrat of the soundwav can have free plai
the nostril
the nostril should be dilat as much as possibl as a free wide
open nose give a free wellround tone while a contract nostril
induc the nasal tone so much dread a proper train of the
facial muscl make thi dilat possibl lift the upper lip and
project it forward aid the action to a great degre
there is a strong tendenc to uniti of action between the nostril and
the lip and the soft palat the soft palat move downward and
forward when the upper lip protrud and the nostril dilat and
move backward and upward when the nostril ar contract and the
upper lip allow to rest upon the teeth
as a rule the best singer have full round wide open nostril
either given by natur or acquir by practic
the face
not onli must the lip and nose be train but the muscl of the
face also these muscl ar capabl if educ of do import
servic
the artist on the operat stage or the speaker on the platform
without facial express begotten of muscular activ mai lessen by
half hi power over an audienc to train the facial muscl is a
complic task to do thi stand befor a mirror and make all the
face ever thought of by a schoolboi to amus hi schoolmat rais
each corner of the lip wrinkl the nose quilt the forehead grin
laugh the grimac will not enter into a perform but their
effect upon it will be markedli benefici
chapter ii
the speak voic and pronunci
a gener ago the speak voic wa even less understood than the
sing voic that the two were intim connect wa but half
surmis onli an occasion person recogn what is now gener
conced that a good wai to improv the speak voic is to
cultiv the sing voic
in 1887 i publish a paper in the independ practition defin
the sing voic and the speak voic as ident and contend
that the train for each should be the same so far as tone format
is involv a conclus at which i had arriv sever year befor
subsequ experi ha onli serv to confirm thi opinion
the past ha produc mani good speaker among them henri clai
daniel webster edwin booth wm charl macreadi and edward everett
of the last oliv wendel holm wrote it is with delight that on
who rememb edward everett in hi robe of rhetor splendor
recal hi full blown high color doubl flower period the
rich reson grave farreach music of hi speech with just
enough of the nasal vibrat to give the vocal soundingboard it
proper valu in the harmoni of utter these exampl of correct
vocal howev were except to the gener rule thei
happen to speak well but the physiolog action of the vocal organ
which produc such result in those individu case wa not
understood and henc the pupil ambiti to imit them and develop
the best of which hi voic wa capabl had no rule by which to
proce few could speak with eas still fewer could be heard by a
larg assembl and sore throat seem to be the rule
differ between sing and speak
in sing the flow of tone is unbroken between the word but in
speak it is interrupt in sing tone is sustain and chang
from on pitch to anoth by definit interv over a wide compass
that includ note not attempt in speech in speak tone is
unsustain not defin in pitch is limit to a narrow compass and
the length of the tone is not govern by the measur of music
notwithstand these differ sing and speak tone ar
produc by the vocal organ in the same wai ar focus precis
alik have the same reson and ar deliv in the same manner
it ha been said that speech differ from song as walk from
danc speech mai be call the prose and song the poetri of
vocal
dure the past decad the knowledg of the speak voic ha been
greatli broaden and the art of cultiv tone ha made progress
the ident of the sing and speak voic is becom more fulli
recogn and method ar be us to develop the latter similar
to those in us for the train of the former as dr morel
mackenzi sai sing is a help to good speak as the greater
includ the less
the recognit of thi truth cannot fail to be a great aid to the
progress of sing in the public school sinc everi enlarg of
exercis common to both speak and sing help to solidar and
esprit de corp in teach and in learn
an accur sens of pitch melodi harmoni and rhythm is necessari
to the singer but the orat mai by cultiv develop a speak
voic of music qualiti without be abl to distinguish old
hundr from the last rose of summer
pronunci
it is a matter of common observ that american singer although
thei mai be painstak in their french and german ar indiffer
even to careless in the clear and finish enunci of their
nativ tongu mr wj henderson in hi recent work the art of the
singer sai the typic american singer cannot sing hi own
languag so that an audienc can understand him ninetenth of the
song we hear ar song without word happili thi condit is
gradual yield to a better on stimul in part by the exampl
of visit singer and actor in storytel song and in
oratorio slovenli deliveri is reprehens but when the word of a
song ar the lyric flight of a true poet a careless utter becom
intoler
beauti of tone is not everyth the sing of mere sound howev
love is but a tickl of the ear the shortcom of the italian
school of sing as of composit ha been too exclus devot
to sensuou beauti of tone as an end in itself the singer must never
forget that hi mission is to vital text with tone the song of
schubert schumann franz brahm grieg strauss and wolf as well
as the wagnerian drama ar signific in their insepar union of
text and music the singer is therefor an interpret not of music
alon but of text made potent by music
pronunci moreov concern not onli the listen but the
singer and speaker for pure tone and pure pronunci cannot be
divorc on cannot exist without the other in hi interest work
the sing of the futur mr ffrangcondavi insist that the
quickest wai to fine tone is through fine pronunci
we cannot think except in word nor voic our thought without speech
vocal utter is thought articul therefor instead of prolong
attent to tone itself train should be concentr upon the
utter word the student should aim to sing a word rather than a
tone correct pronunci and beauti tone ar so interdepend
as to be insepar
the singer and speaker requir all sound in their puriti to seek to
develop the voic along the narrow limit of ani singl vowel or
syllabl as for instanc the syllabl ah is harm not onli is
thi vowel sound as lilli lehmann sai the most difficult but the
proper pronunci of all word within the whole rang of the voic
is therebi imped diction and tone work should therefor go hand in
hand the wai in which vowel melt into vowel and conson float
into their place larg determin the charact of the tone
itself without finish pronunci speech and song of emot
power ar imposs gounod the compos sai pronunci
creat eloqu mr forbesrobertson the english master of
dramat diction speak for hi own profess sai the troubl
with contemporari stage elocut spring from the actor veri desir
to act well in hi effort to be natur he mumbl hi word as too
mani peopl do in everydai life much of thi can be correct by
constantli bear in mind the true valu of vowel the percuss
valu of conson and the import of keep up the voic until
the last word is spoken there must be so to speak plenti of wind in
the bellow the great thing is to have the sound come from the front
of the mouth the actor must learn to breath deepli from the
diaphragm and to take hi breath at the proper time too often the
last word is not held up and that is veri often the import
word school for act ar valuabl but after all the
actor like other folk must be taught how to speak as children in
the home at school and in societi
in pronunci the word should seem to be form by the upper lip
and to come out through it by thi method it will be found easi to
pronounc distinctli the word will thu be form outsid the mouth
and be readili heard as is a person talk in front of instead of
behind a screen a singl intellig trial will be suffici to
show the correct of the statement think of the upper lip as
the fashion of the word make speak easi and sing a delight
to smile while talk give to the word a flat silli sound henc
the corner of the mouth should be kept well forward

breath control
it ha been said that breath is sing thi statement is
equal applic to speak while the aphor is not liter
true it is true that without properli control breath the best
sing or speak tone cannot be produc for tone is but vocal
breath henc in the cultiv of the voic breath is the first
function to receiv attent
for singer or speaker the correct us of the breath apparatu
determin the question of success or failur for without masteri of
the motiv power all els is unavail for a voic user therefor
the first requisit is a welldevelop chest the second complet
control of it
it must not be suppos that a singer breath is someth strang
or complex for it is noth more than an amplif of normal
healthi breath in contrast howev to the undisciplin casual
breath of the gener public the singer is a profession

the muscl of respir
there ar two set of respiratori muscl on for inspir and
anoth for expirationtwentytwo or more in all the princip
muscl of inspir ar the diaphragm and the intercost muscl
that elev the rib the chief muscl of expir ar the four
set of abdomin muscl and the intercost muscl that depress the
rib the diaphragm is not a muscl of expir
the diaphragm
the diaphragm is in form like an invert bowl fig 8 it form the
floor of the thorax chest and the roof of the abdomen it is
attach by a strong tendon to the spinal column behind and to the
wall of the thorax at it lowest part which is below the rib in
front it attach is to the cartilag at the pit of the stomach it
also connect with the transvers abdomin muscl the diaphragm
be convex in inspir the contract of it fibr flatten it
downward and press down the organ in the abdomen thu increas
the depth of the thorax expir depend wholli on other muscl
illustr figur 8
the muscl so far mention ar all that need consciou educ
the other will act with them voluntarili automat the
abdomin muscl relax dure inspir and the diaphragm relax
dure expir thu render the forc nearli equal though the
strength is in favor of the expiratori muscl thi is what is
need for the breath while speak or sing must go out under
much greater tension than is necessari for inhal inspir
should be as free as possibl from obstruct when sing or
speak expir must be under control pressur
the lung
the lung ar spongi bodi which have no activ of their own beyond
a littl elast thei ar control by the muscl of
respir
figur 8 show the organ of the bodi in their natur posit the
diaphragm is relax and curv upward as in expir dure
inspir the diaphragm is drawn down until it li nearli flat

the intercost muscl rais the rib the diaphragm is drawn down by
contract thu ad to the enlarg of the chest by increas

and other organ in the abdomen to move downward to make room for the
depress diaphragm thi caus a vacuum in the chest the lung
expand to fill thi vacuum and the air rush in to fill the expand
lung

the intercost and a part of the abdomin muscl depress the rib
and lessen the chest caviti anteriorli and later the abdomin
muscl compress the abdomen and forc up the diaphragm which is now

the most frequent caus of sing off the kei thei ar much more
common and mischiev than lack of ear
dr mai test the breath of 85 person most of them indian and
found that 79 out of the 85 us abdomin breath the chest
breather were from class civil and more or less cultur
natur ha provid that for quiet breath when at rest the air
shall pass through the nose but when a person is take activ
exercis and consequ demand more air he natur and of
necess open the mouth so as to breath more fulli while speak
or sing the air is necessarili taken in through the mouth
breath control
firm of tone depend upon steadi of breath pressur
steadi of tone depend upon a control of the breath which allow a
minimum volum of air to pass out under suffici tension to produc
vocal
the tension and flow of breath can be gradual lessen until the
tone vanish and not even a whisper remain
power and larg of tone depend first upon the right us of the
reson caviti and second upon the volum of breath us under
proper control
in produc high tone the breath is deliv in less amount than
for the low tone but under greater tension absolut control of the
breath is necessari to produc the best result of which a voic is
capabl full control of the breath insur success to a good voic
without it the best voic is doom to failur
when muscular action is fulli master and the proper method of
breath understood and establish the muscl of inspir and
expir will act on against the other so that the act of
breath mai be suspend at ani moment whether the lung ar full
or partli full or empti thi is muscular control of the breath
correct breath is health give and strength give it promot
nutrit lessen the amount of adipos tissu and reinforc everi

it cannot be too wide advertis that the surest remedi for that
tortur of singer and speaker nervous is the great
tranquillizerquiet deep breath deepli control the breath
of nervous is quick irregular and shallow therefor take a
few slow deliber deep and rhythmic inhal of pure air

necess of breath exercis
to acquir control of breath proper exercis must be
intellig and persist follow in mankind natur seem to
have been divert from her normal cours so that we seldom find an
individu who breath correctli without educ in the matter
what we have said on breath is base on the premis that
respir involv cordin action of the bodi from collarbon to
the base of the abdomen that is expand and contract the chest
and abdomen simultan thi is call lateralabdomin
breath as the chest is the thorac caviti abdominothorac

work on ani other line fail to develop the full power and qualiti of

these diagram ar made from photograph and thu true to life it
will be notic that there is no differ in the breath outlin
between these subject the femal subject though a good singer had
had no train in breath she previous insist that she us

it is not unlik that mani other singer who now think thei ar

test find themselv similarli mistaken
the contract incid to forc expir is much more tens than
the enlarg of forc inspir when sing or speak
forc inspir is not us experi show that the chang in

the quantiti of air taken in with a singl inspir is in quiet
breath accord to prof mills3 from twenti to thirti cubic
inch but thi mai be increas in the deepest inspir to about
on hundr cubic inch in forcibl expir about on hundr
cubic inch mai be expel but even then the residu air that
cannot be expel is about on hundr cubic inch

it is not howev the quantiti of breath inhal that is
signific it is the amount control get therefor all the
breath necessari and keep it but without undu effort and without
rigid
to test the amount of breath us in prolong vocal a person
skill in the art of breath after an ordinari inspir close
hi lip stop hi nostril and began to vocal he found that
the mouth with distend cheek held suffici breath to continu a
substanti tone for twentythre second
while these experi show that veri littl amount or forc of
breath is need to produc effect tone the impress must exist
in the mind of the perform that there is a free flow of breath
through the larynx otherwis the tone will seem restrict and will
be weak the forc hold back of the breath beget a restraint that
ha a bad effect on the singer deliveri while the breath must be
control there is such a thing as an exagger breath control
that make free deliveri of the voic imposs
it is quit possibl to overcrowd the lung with air do not

reserv breath power
the correctli train singer or speaker will never allow the breath
power to be exhaust some breath should be taken in at everi
conveni interv between the word accord to the punctuat
but never between syllabl of a word thi is correct phrase in
thi wai the lung ar kept nearli full and breath is at it best
the chief caus of breath exhaust is wast breath thi wast
come from exhal more breath more motiv power than the tone
requir and breath that doe not becom tone is wast thi fault

the singer should alwai feel abl to sing anoth note or to speak
anoth word to sing or speak thirti or forti count with on breath

regist
the subject of regist ha alwai been the bte noir of
vocalist a sourc of controversi and confus the term regist
as commonli us mean a seri of tone of a characterist clang or
qualiti produc by the same mechan the term break is gener
us to indic the point at which a new regist with sudden chang
appear
the advoc of regist lai stress either on the chang in
laryng action or the chang in tone qualiti befor the dai of
the laryngoscop regist were treat simpli as differ qualiti
of tone character a certain portion of the voic compass
those who encourag the cultiv of regist conscious claim to
do so for the sake of the differ in tonecolor which thei
associ with the differ regist the purpos of the follow
chapter is to show that the qualiti or color of a tone is altogeth
a matter of reson and not a question of laryng action
moreov the mechan of the larynx is not voluntari in it action
but automat and even if a singer knew how the vocal cord should
act it would not help him in the least to govern their action the
fact is that the result of laryngoscop studi of the vocal cord
have been disappoint and contradictori and investig have
fail to defin what correct laryng action is there ar those who
even deni that the vocal cord govern the pitch of the voic
in her thought philosophi of sing clara kathleen roger
while uphold regist sai that consid physiolog the
differ regist of the voic should be regard by the singer as
onli so mani modif in the qualiti of tone which
modif ar inher in the voic itself she then add
significantli these modif ar not brought about by consciou
adjust of the part emploi as ani interfer with the part
will produc that obstacl to qualiti we call a break
on of the greatest of modern singer mme lilli lehmann in her
interest work how to sing sai do regist exist by natur
no it mai be said that thei ar creat through long year of
speak in the vocal rang that is easiest to the person or in on
adopt by imit she speak of three rang of the voic or
rather three section of the vocal rang as chest middl and head
sai all three form regist when exagger after speak
of the hopeless confus that result from cling to the
appel of chest middl and head regist confound voic
with regist she conclud
as long as the word regist is kept in us the regist will not
disappear and yet the regist question must be swept awai to give
place to anoth class of idea sounder view on the part of
teacher and a truer concept on the part of singer and pupil
the trend of recent thought on thi subject is further shown in
ffrangcondavi import work the sing of the futur where
have in mind the useless tortur to which thousand of student
have been subject he character break and regist as
paraphernalia suppli by credul to charlatan and add how
mani a poor pupil ha becom a practic monomaniac on the subject of
that break in my voic between d and d sharp
my own studi convinc me that there is but on regist or rather
no such thing as regist save as it appli to the compass of the
voic and that chest middl head and all other regist ar
creation of fals educ train base upon the theori of mani
regist result in an artifici and unnatur divis of the
voic
the voic and instrument compar
the organ of the voic ha long been consid the analogu of everi
other instrument except in regard to regist investig
indic that it is analog in thi respect also compar the voic
instrument with the pianofort violin and organ and the similar
will plainli appear the artifici instrument undergo no chang when
make a tone of higher or lower pitch other than the attun of the
vibrat to the pitch desir all other part remain the same so
when the voic is correctli focus and deliv the onli chang
incid to alter pitch is that made in the vibrat so as to give
the proper number of vibrat for the pitch requir if the scale
is sung down us the same vowel sound for the whole scale the
comparison will be appreci the pupil will not be consciou of ani
chang in the vocal organ or experi ani difficulti in descend
the scale faith advoc of the theori of mani regist sai
whenev in doubt about the product of a tone sing down to it
from some tone abov it never upward from a tone below for thei
find that sing down blend the regist thi we believ is
becaus in sing down muscular and nerv tension is gradual
relax and consequ there is no regist chang in the voic
a studi of the church organ will i think make thi matter clear the
organ ha mani socal regist as the vox humana flute
obo etc these differ in the charact of tone produc becaus
of the size and shape of the differ set of pipe and the materi
wood or metal of which thei ar made but each similarli construct
set of pipe form onli on regist and the pitch of the set vari
from low to high without ani abrupt chang in qualiti all the tone
ar produc by the same method and mean the bellow the vibrat
and the pipe in length and diamet the pipe is proper to the tone
produc a short pipe of small diamet for the high tone and a
long wide pipe for the bass tone
the short vibrat of the high tone ar perceiv by the ear as
affect the air onli while the tone of the lowest bass pipe
shake the solid foundat as well as the superstructur so with the
human voic the coarser tissu cannot answer to the short vibrat
of the upper tone becaus thei cannot move so quickli while thei
can and do respond to the vibrat of the low tone thi mai
caus some differ in degre but not in kind with all tone
focus alik the low tone of the human organ mai be regard as
head tone plu the vibrat of the coarser tissu
it ha been said of regist that thei ar acoust illus which
disappear in the perfectli train voic as soon as the singer ha
learn to us hi voic normal all these defect chang
disappear

began although singer and scientist yet continu to look upon each
other with suspicion teacher of the voic cast about for a

footnot 4 die lehr von den tonempfindungen al physiologisch

physiolog basi for the theori of music
write in 1886 edmund j meyer speak of the import of a studi
of the influenc of the differ reson caviti as the voic is
color by on or the other and the tune each to each and each to
all yet he add the subject is seldom heard of outsid of book
the basic import of reson in the us of the voic is still too
littl recogn though obviou enough in the construct of
music instrument with the except of a few instrument of
percuss all music instrument possess three elementsa
motor a vibrat and a reson the violin ha the move
bow for a motor the string for a vibrat and the hollow bodi for a
reson the french horn ha the lung of the perform for a motor
the lip for a vibrat and the gradual enlarg tube termin
in the flare bell for a reson in the pianofort the
hammerstrok the string and the soundingboard perform the
correspond offic though improv in other part of the piano
have done much to increas the volum of the tone yet in the radic
chang of form size and other physic qualiti of the
soundingboard consist the evolut of the modern pianofort from
the primit clavichord
in all these instrument the qualiti and power of the tone depend upon
the presenc of these three elementsth perfect of their
construct their proper relat as to size and posit and the
perfect adapt of each part a split soundingboard spoil the
pianofort the indent bell destroi the sweet tone of the french
horn and a crack fiddl is the synonym for pandemonium itself
the qualiti and power of reson is well illustr by a
tuningfork which if set in vibrat can unaid scarc be
heard by the person hold it but if rest on a tabl or a plate
of glass or better still on the bridg of a violin it tone mai
be distinctli heard throughout a larg hall
the vibrat violin string when detach from the bodi of thi
instrument although attun to pitch give absolut no music
sound the lip of the player place on the mouthpiec detach from
the tube and bell of the brass instrument produc onli a splutter and
a pianofort without a soundingboard is nil the air column in the
tube of the french horn and the soundingboard of the pianofort
develop the vibrat caus by the lip and string into music
tone pleas to the ear the tuningfork alon can scarc be
heard while the induc vibrat it set up through properli
adjust reson mai be audibl far awai
the vocal cord alon cannot make music ani more than can the lip of
the cornet player apart from hi instrument the tone produc by the
vibrat alon of the two veri small vocal band must in the natur
of thing be veri feebl
ninetyandnin person if ask the question what produc tone in
the humanvoic would repli the vibrat of the vocal cord
and stop there as if that were all wherea the answer is veri
incompletenot even half an answer
a great deal of the irrat and injuri teach of sing
that prevail everywher and of the controversi that befog the
subject is due to the wide preval notion that the littl vocal
cord ar the princip caus of tone wherea thei ar in themselv
insignific as sound produc
it is the vibrat of the air in the reson chamber of the human
instrument togeth with the induc vibrat of the instrument
itself which give tone it sonor it reach it color and
emot power
that thi is not an empir statement but a scientif fact a few
simpl experi will demonstr
tone in the music sens is the result of rapid period vibrat
the pitch of tone depend upon the number of vibrat in a given
period the loud of tone depend upon the amplitud of the
vibrat the qualiti of tone depend upon the form of the
vibrat and the form of the vibrat depend upon the
reson
the fact that pure white light is a compound of all the tint of the
rainbow into which it mai be resolv by the prism is well known but
the analog fact that a pure music tone is a compound of tone of
differ rate of vibrat tone of differ pitch is not so much
a matter of common knowledg and not so obviou
analysi show that a music tone consist of a fundament note and
a seri of overtones5 the ear is quit capabl of recogn mani
of these overton and mai be train to do so the most obviou can
be readili separ from a fundament by a simpl experi
footnot 5 for fuller exposit see tyndal on sound or the
section devot to acoust in ani textbook on physic
the overton arrang themselv in a definit order as follow 1
the fundament or prime tone 2 an overton on octav abov the
fundament 3 an overton a fifth abov no 2 4 an overton a
fourth abov no 3 two octav abov the fundament 5 an
overton a major third abov no 4 6 an overton a minor third
abov no 5 there ar other in still higher rang but those
indic ar easili demonstr on the piano for c thei would be as
follow
music illustr
experi i
step to your piano noiselessli press and hold down the kei of no 2
then strike the fundament no 1 with forc and immedi releas
it as a result no 2 will sound clearli and if your ear ar keen
you will at the same time hear no 6 in success hold down the kei
of 3 4 5 and 6 while you strike and releas the fundament no 1
if your piano is in tune you will probabl hear no 6 when hold
the kei of ani other note of the seri
in a music tone of rich qualiti the overton just indic ar
present in their ful while tone that is weak and thin is made so
by the absenc or weak of the overton i have state that the
qualiti of a tone depend on the form of it vibrat and that
the form of it vibrat is determin by the charact of the
reson we can now amplifi thi by sai that while the rel
presenc or absenc of overton determin the clang or color of a
tone their presenc or absenc is determin by the charact of the
reson
an english writer record that he wa onc in the garden at the back
of a hous while a gentleman wa sing in the drawingroom the
tonequ wa good and the pitch so unusu high he hasten to
learn who sang tenor high c so beautifulli on enter the room
instead of the tenor he had suppos he found the singer wa a
bariton and the note sung wa onli middl c the fundament tone
had not reach him in the garden but the first overton an octav
abov it had concret illustr will make the subject still
clearer
experi ii
if an ordinari tuningfork when vibrat is held in the hand it
intrins tone is too weak to carri far rest the handl of the
vibrat fork on a bare tabl or the panel of the door and the sound
is greatli augment the vibrat of the fork have by contact
induc similar vibrat in the wooden tabl or panel which
reinforc the primari tone
experi iii
place the handl of the vibrat tuningfork on a small upturn
empti box or better still in contact with the bodi of a violin and
the sound will be stronger than in the previou experi becaus to
the vibrat of the wood ar ad the vibrat of the air
enclos in the box or the violin to the reson of the wood ha
been ad the sympathet reson of the confin air
experi iv
hold the vibrat fork over the mouth of an empti fruitjar and there
will probabl be littl or no reinforc but gentli pour in water
therebi shorten the air column within the jar and the sound of the
fork will be gradual intensifi until at a certain point it becom
quit loud if you pour in still more water the sound will gradual
becom feebler thi show that for everi tone an air column of a
certain size most powerfulli reinforc that tone
experi v
as a sequenc to the last experi take two fruitjar of the same
size and have learn to what point to fill them for the greatest
reson fill on jar after warm it to the requir point with
hot water the other with cold water and you will find that the
reson of the heat therefor expand air is much less than the
denser air of the cold jar thi show that the degre of densiti of
the air affect it reson
experi vi
to demonstr the reson of the oral caviti apart from the voic
hold a vibrat tuningfork befor the open mouth vari the shape and
size of the caviti until the sound of the fork suddenli increas in
volum show that the right adjust for reson ha been made
thi intensif of the sound is due to the vibrat of the air
in the mouth caviti togeth with the sympathet vibrat of the
surround wall
experi vii
as an illustr of sympathet reson without contact sing
forcibl a tone that is within easi rang and at the same time
silent hold down the correspond kei of the piano on ceas to
sing you will hear the tone sound in the piano thi mai be further
illustr by plai on the open string of on violin while anoth
tune to the same pitch rest untouch near by through sympathet
reson the correspond string of the second violin will vibrat
and sound it note the louder the first violin is plai the louder
will be the sympathet tone of the second
the deep pedalton of a church organ often induc sympathet
reson that mai be felt beneath the feet of the listen on
writer a singer speak of live in the same hous with two
deafmut he lodg on the first floor thei on the third on dai
meet at luncheon on of the deafmut told the singer that he had
begun practic earlier that morn than usual surpris the writer
ask how he knew the deafmut repli that thei alwai knew when he
wa sing becaus thei felt the floor of their room vibrat
if tone vibrat can be transmit so readili throughout a hous
it is not difficult to understand how easili the vibrat of bone
and tissu can be transmit until the whole framework of the bodi
respond in percept vibrat
it is said that pascal at the ag of twelv wrote a dissert on
acoust suggest by hi childish discoveri that when a metal dish
wa struck by a knife the result sound could be stop by touch
the vibrat dish with a finger
with thi in mind it is not difficult to understand how compress of
the human instrument by the pressur of tight cloth without or by
fals muscular tension within must interfer with it free vibrat
and so rob the produc tone of just so much of perfect
from these experi we can understand that while the tone of the
voic ar initi by or at the vocal cord the volum and charact
of the tone ar depend upon resonanceth vibrat of the air
in the variou reson chamber of the bodi togeth with the
sympathet vibrat of the wall of these chamber and the boni
framework that support them
in respect to reson as in other respect the human voic is far
superior to all other instrument for their reson ar fix and
unchang while the human reson is flexiblein helmholtz
word admit of much varieti of form so that mani more qualiti of
tone can be thu produc than on ani instrument of artifici
construct
we ar now prepar to realiz the error of the common notion that
loud of tone is due entir to increas of breath pressur on the
vocal cord simpl experi with the tuningfork have shown that
while the volum of sound it give forth is due in part to the
amplitud of it vibrat it loud is chiefli due to the
charact of the reson provid for it
the larger the reson chamber the greater is it reinforc
capac the largest air chamber in the bodi is the chest which
serv not onli as a windchest but as a reson chamber the
necess for chest expans therefor is not as gener
suppos mere for air but to increas it size as a reson
chamber
in view of the law of tone how great is the common error of speak
of the larynx as if it alon were the vocal organ when the princip
vibrat ar abov the vocal cord in the chamber of reson
sinc the music valu the beauti of tone as well as it volum
come onli from right us of the reson our princip busi
must be the acquir control of the vibratori air current abov the
larynx the acquir of thi control involv the proper focus
or place of the tone with the free uncramp us of all the vocal
organ power will then take care of itself
chapter vii
head and nasal reson
of the four compon factor in the product of speech and song
the first the motor ha been consid in chapter iii and the
second the vibrat in chapter i
in on respect there is mark contrast between these two factor
until right habit ar so thoroughli form that the singer
breath is automat control consciou effort is necessari
while the action of the vibrat the vocal cord is involuntari not
subject to consciou control
the subtl adjust of the delic mechan of the larynx belong
to the realm of reflex actionto a spontan activ that left
unhind doe it part in perfect niceti
the vocal cord must in their action be free from the disturb of
uncontrol breath action below them or the hindranc due to
misdirect effort abov them to direct conscious to the vocal
cord is to cramp them and prevent that free vibrat and that
perfect relax of the throat without which pure tone and true
pitch ar imposs
as a surgeon i well know the valu of thorough anatom knowledg
but from the singer standpoint i cannot too strongli emphas the
unwisdom of direct the attent of sensit organ pupil to
their vocal mechan by mean of the laryngoscop thi instrument
belong to the physician not to the singer
the import of the third factor the reson ha been
consid in chapter v on reson but the fourth element in voic
product articul is so cordin to reson that the
signific and primaci of the latter ar too often overlook
place or focus the voic i have found to be chiefli a matter
of control and us of the reson consist of chest pharynx
mouth and the nasal and head caviti
a tone lack in reson is ineffectivedevoid of carri
poweri diffus and unfocus while a reson tone no matter how
soft dynam ha carri power and is focus in it vibrat
now voic place depend primarili on correct vowel place
which in turn depend on proper adjust of the reson which
again depend chiefli on the posit and motion of the organ of
articul the interdepend of tone qualiti and pronunci is
therefor obviou
constant emphasi must be laid upon the fact that focus a tone is a
matter of reson and that perhap the most import element in
thi is nasal reson in thi countri particularli teacher
have in their desir to overcom the too common nasal twang
mistakenli sought to shut out the nasal chamber from all particip
in speech and song
there ar those who partli recogn the import of head
reson would secur it while ignor nasal reson it is
imposs to secur head reson in thi fashion for it is onli
through free nasal reson that the cordin reson in the air
sinus abov the nasal caviti and connect with it can be
establish
the fear of nasal twang and failur to distinguish between it and true
nasal reson ha been the stumbl block thei ar veri
differenton is to be shun the other to be cultiv the
first is an obviou blemish the second is an import essenti of
good sing
nasal tone ar caus by a rais or stiffen tongu a sag soft
palat a stiffen jaw or by other rigid that prevent free tone
emiss and which at the same timenot thisprev true nasal
reson
as tone or vocal breath issu from the larynx it is divid
into two stream or current by the pendent veil of the soft palat
on stream flow directli into the mouth where it produc oral
reson the other stream pass through the nasopharynx into the
hollow chamber of the face and head induc nasal and head
reson
it is commonli suppos that tone pass in whole or in part through
the nasal caviti must be nasal in qualiti wherea a tone of
objection nasal qualiti can be sung equal well with the nostril
either close or open
brown and behnk state the matter thu howev tight the closur of
the soft palat mai be it is never suffici to prevent the air in
the nasal caviti be thrown into covibr with that in the
mouth these covibr ar in fact necessari for a certain
amount of the brillianc of the voic and if thei ar prevent by a
stoppag of the posterior open of the nasal passag the voic
will sound dull and muffl thi is of cours due to an absenc of
nasal reson and must on no account be describ as nasal
twang it is inde the veri opposit of it
nasal tone qualiti and nasal reson must not be confound a nasal
tone is constrict while a tone with nasal reson is free again
a tone mai be unmar by the nasal qualiti yet if it lack nasal
reson it lack vibranc carri power
nasal tone ar produc not becaus the vibrat pass through the
nasal passag but becaus thei ar obstruct in their passag
through them a nasal tone is alwai a cramp tone due to
impedi tension or muscular contract particularli in the
nasopharynx
the congest and consequ thicken of the mucou membran line
the caviti of the nose and head result from a cold make the
tone muffl and weak ow to the inabl of the part to respond
to the vibrat and add to the tone normal nasal reson
the elder booth juniu brutu about 1838 suffer from a broken
nose which defac hi handsom visag and spoil hi splendid voic
hi disabl wa so great that afterward he seldom plai that the
caus of thi impair of booth voic wa due to the contract
and more or less complet obstruct of the nasal passag is too
evid to call for comment
mani singer have sweet but characterless voic that lack the
ful power and ring thei might have becaus thei fail to avail
themselv of the augment power of the reson caviti the
singer must learn to habitu us all of the reson caviti and
us them simultan
lilli lehmann in how to sing sai that although the nasal sound
can be exaggeratedwhich rare happensit can be much
neglectedsometh that veri often happen the context make
clear that what in the english translat of the great singer book
is call nasal sound is exactli what we term nasal reson
after charg the monoton qualiti or lack of color in the voic of
a famou opera star to lack of nasal reson madam lehmann speak
of the consumm art of marcella sembrich who in recent year
appear to have devot veri special studi to nasal reson wherebi
her voic especi in the middl regist ha gain greatli in
warmth she sai further that nasal reson cannot be studi
enough it ought alwai to be emploi how often she sai have
i heard young singer sai i no longer have the power to respond to
the demand made upon me wherea the troubl li onli in the
insuffici us of the reson of the head caviti
from the forego the conclus follow that the head vibrat
ar not onli an essenti element but that nasal reson is a most
import element in impart to tone it brillianc and carri
power without thought of the mechan of how nasal reson is
produc the singer ha control over it by direct influenc of the
will the tone low as well as high should seem to start in the nose
and head and the vibrat of the perfect tone can be plainli felt
upon ani part of the nose and head without the head vibrat no
tone can be perfect for noth els will compens for the lack of
these vocal organ us as here describ will suffer no fatigu
from reason us hoars will be to them a thing unknown and
minist sore throat an unheard of complaint not onli is faulti
voic product a sourc of great discomfort but it is the caus of
mani diseas of the chest throat and head
the gentl practic in easi rang of the exercis given in the
chapter follow will do much to restor a normal condit
chapter viii
place the voic
what is call place the voic or tone product or focus
the voic is as alreadi state in the previou chapter chiefli a
matter of resonanceof control of the reson now vocal is
larg vowel and vocal tone ar a complex of sound and
reson the charact of a vowel is given it by the shape of the
vowel chamber and the shape of the vowel chamber depend upon
delic adjust of the movabl partsjaw lip cheek tongu
veil of the palat and pharynx while thi adjust is made through
more or less consciou muscular action the part must never be forc
into posit local effort to thi end will invari defeat itself
the import consider in all voic movement is a flexibl
natur action of all the part and all the voic movement ar so
close alli so sympathet relat that if on movement is
constrain the other cannot be free it is a happi fact that the
right wai is the easiest wai and a fundament truth that right
effort is the result of right thought from these axiomat principl
we deduc the veri first rule for the singer and speakerthink the
right tone mental pictur it then concentr upon the pictur
not upon the mechan
when is the vocal action correct
there ar two sound criterion for judg the correct of vocal

who attain the end with the least expenditur of energi second the
beauti of the result harsh unlov tone ar a sure indic of
misplac effort of tension somewher of wrong action on the other
hand the nearer the tone approach to perfect the closer doe the
organ come to correct action beauti of tone then is the truest
indic of proper vocal action
judgment as to the rel beauti of a tone depend on the train
of the ear pupil should habitu listen to their own voic for
between the hear and feel of the voic a knowledg of progress
can be obtain the function of the ear in govern voic product

the ear to the brain ar the most import guid in determin the

exercis for practic

i give but few exercis for each point to be gain intellig
teacher and pupil will add an infinit varieti to suit each case
but the exercis given appear to me to be the best for initi
practic it is import that each exercis in it order shall be
thoroughli master befor take up the next onli in thi wai can
rapid progress be made for it is not the multipl of exercis
but the thought applic of principl in the few that lead to
result
the sound of hng will alwai place the voic in proper focu by
develop the reson of the nose and head the thin bone of the
nose will first respond to the sound and after practic the vibrat

time without number prolong the ng sound at least four count
to insur the proper cours of the vowel sound through the nasal
passag follow hung with the vowel ee as thi vowel is more
easili focus than ani other then with oo oh aw and ah
ah is by far the most difficult sound to focu and should never be
us for initi practic much valuabl time ha been lost by the
custom of us thi sound at first it should come last
the h is chosen to introduc the vowel sound becaus in the

chapter ix
throat stiff
what is the most frequent obstacl to good sing the difficulti
with which pupil and teacher most contend throat stiff what more
than anyth els mar the sing of those we hear in drawingroom
church and the concert room throat stiff
thi is the vice that prevent true inton rob the voic of it
express limit it rang lessen it flexibl diminish
it volum and make true reson imposs
thi great interfer not onli lessen the beauti of ani voic but
directli affect the organ itself the muscl of the larynx ar small
and delic and the adjust thei make in sing ar exceedingli
fine when howev the voic user stiffen hi throat these
delic muscl in their spontan effort to make the proper
adjust ar compel to contract with more than their normal
strength everi increas in throat stiff demand a correspond
increas in muscl effort an overexert that persist in must
result in injuri to the organ itself such misus of the voic is
bound to show injuri result everi throat specialist know thi
and an untold multitud of those who begin with promis have had
to give up sing as a career learn it too late
singer ar so accustom to the sound of their own voic as to be
usual quit unconsci of their own throat stiff though thei
mai recogn it in their neighbor
unfortun throat stiff by it veri natur tend to aggrav
itself to constantli increas while the voic becom less and less
respons to the singer demand
there ar a number of contribut caus to throat stiff but the
princip caus is throat conscious and misplac effort due
larg to current misconcept regard the voic a common notion
is that we sing with the throat wherea we sing through it akin to
thi error is the notion as common as it is fallaci that forc of
tone carri power origin in the larynx wherea the initi
tone due to the vibrat of the vocal cord is in itself
compar feebl as shown at length in chapter vi and vii
volum of tone it color and carri power is acoust and
vocal a matter of reson
mani there ar who sing by dint of sheer forc and ignor but
their career ar necessarili short the too common vulgar strive
for power rather than for beauti or puriti of tone induc unnatur
effort and strain that both directli and sympathet affect the
throat with stiff
unnatur effort in breath overeffort in breath control as well
as sing without adequ breath all induc tension that is
reflect at onc in the sensit throat
impati of result american hurri beget unnatur effort and
tension unclasp the finger of a rigid civil from off your
throat the student of the violin or the piano soon learn that onli
by a long and patient prepar can he fit himself to entertain even
hi admir friend the embryo singer on the contrari expect with
far less expenditur of time and effort to appear in public
the human voic is a direct express of the man himself it
regist spontan hi mental and emot state even when he
would wish them hidden mental condit ting with impati with
fear or with anyth that beget tension of ani sort ar reflect
instantli in the voic rob it of it better qualiti and
induc stiff in the throat
reduc to it lowest term voic cultur todai is a struggl with
throat stiff
the caus indic the remedi foremost then is drop all throat
conscious all thought of the throat all draw of attent to
it the larynx must be left uncramp unhind to do it work in
free unconsci which it will do if not disturb by tension in
it neighborhood or by misdirect thought
the stream of conscious must in sing be direct to the
breath which is below the throat and to reson and
pronunci which ar abov it these function ar more or less
conscious control until at last masteri make their action
automat
i would onc more emphas the fact that the free us of all the
reson chamber and the recognit of the great function of
reson will do more than anyth els to set the voic free and
emancip the singer from all interf rigid
chapter x
some gener consider
the natur voic
pupil ar constantli urg to sing and speak natur becaus the
natur tone is correct thi is exceedingli indefinit it is
natur for a child to imit the first sound it hear whether it be
correct or incorrect in either case the child imit it and for
that child it becom the natur tone the child rear in the
wilder beyond the hear of a human voic will imit the
note of the whippoorwil the chatter of the monkei and the hoot
of the owl and for him thei ar natur tone
to be natur is the hardest lesson to learn and it is onli the result
of imit or prolong disciplin untrain natur is the
perfect of awkward the involuntari function of organ life
ar the onli on natur perform correctli natur method of
breath circul and digest can be depend upon until
disarrang by subsequ condit but unless proper vocal
is establish by imit and disciplin thi function is sure to be
corrupt by fals exampl
ag to begin
after the child begin to talk the sooner hi vocal educ begin
the better even at that earli ag he can be made to understand the
merit of head vibrat and by simpl exercis produc them and
onc taught will never forget them vocal like everi other art
is most easili learn by imit and the advantag of the earli
year when that faculti is most activ should not be lost in olden
time the import of thi wa fulli realiz more than three
centuri ago old roger ascham wrote all languag both learn
and mother tongu ar begotten and gotten sole by imit for
as ye us to hear so ye learn to speak if ye hear no other ye speak
not yourself and of whom ye onli hear of them ye onli learn
nineteen centuri ago quintillian wrote befor all let the nurs
speak properli the boi will hear them first and will try to shape hi
word by imit them
if the right wai of us the voic is earli taught it will be a guard
against the contract of bad habit which can onli be correct
later with infinit troubl it certainli would be unwis to put a
young child under continu train but even in the kindergarten the
right method of voic product can and should be taught teacher of
kindergarten and primari school should be familiar with the
principl of voic train and be abl to start the pupil at onc
on the right road
in public school
the sooner thi branch of educ is made a part of the curriculum
of our common school the sooner shall we produc a race of good
speaker and singer
if dure the pupil school life proper attent is paid to these
primari principl and to correct articul a larg major of
student will graduat from our common school prepar to advanc in
the art of elocut or of sing without be oblig first to
unlearn a vast amount of error and to correct a long list of bad
habit
if each dai in the public school a few minut onli ar devot to
the subject by a teacher who understand it and who will call the
attent of the pupil to the proper applic of the principl
in their daili recit it will be found ampli suffici to
develop and establish a good speak and sing voic
artistri
if artistri is to be attain everi organ must be individu well
train yet dure perform no on part should be given undu
promin the voic should be the product of all the organ equal
well develop continu practic will enabl the perform to
correl the wholeblend the strength of all in on
it goe without sai that no on in sing or speak should
appear to be govern by a method dure the earli stage of
educ pupil should be amen to rule and method but thei
must not expect to be accept perform until abl to forget their
lesson and simpli and unconsci make us of all the advantag of
their train even when the educ is finish and the prima
donna ha made her success debut continu daili repetit of
primari exercis is necessari to maintain excel and insur the
progress that everi perform desir our best singer todai ar as
dilig student of the techniqu of the voic as ar the tyro
struggl with the first element
life period
human life is divid into three period first that of effort to
get an educ second of effort to maintain it and third of
effort to resist the natur declin which come with advanc year
the singer and speaker must drill to develop the voic must drill to
keep it in condit and must drill to resist the encroach of
senil etern vigil is the price of vocal success
applic of essenti
the applic of the principl here discuss will show that a
music voic is not the product of mysteri system but a matter
of scientif certainti the essenti ar good breath good
focus good reson and good articul these four element
ar so interdepend that on cannot be perfect without the other
with these attain the intellect the sentiment and the emot of
the perform will culmin in artist excel
repos as a prepar for vocal exercis
the nervous or fear which manifest itself in constraint and
rigid of the muscl and sometim in stage fright is a seriou
hindranc to progress the effectu offset to thi pain condit
is repos
the art of induc a condit of repos can be readili acquir by
ani on who will carefulli and faithfulli do as follow place
yourself in an easi ly or loung posit in a quiet place with
fresh air physic repos prepar for and invit mental repos now
allow the mind to work care free at it own sweet will without ani
attempt to control it close the ey and breath slowli gentli and
deepli with steadi rhythm in two or three minut a sensat of
quiet rest repos will be experienc which mai be continu for
sever minut or mai even lead to a natur sound sleep
thi result mai not be attain at the first or the second trial but
a few repetit of the exercis will insur success in almost everi
case after the art is attain in thi formal wai abil to induc
the same repos when sit upright or while stand will be
quickli develop
thi repos is the fit prepar for a lesson or a perform
and mai be induc dure the progress of either to allai ani
trepid incid to the situat a masteri of thi simpl art
will make progress in the work of voic develop much more rapid
and make attain a degre of disciplin that is imposs without
it it will prove for the beginn a sure prevent of stage fright
and a great relief to the most chronic suffer from thi maladi
the vibrato
the vibrato is a rhythmic pulsat of the voic it often appear
in untrain voic in other it appear dure the process of
cultiv some have thought it the perfect of sympathet
qualiti other esteem it a fault
the vibrato is caus by an undul variat of pitch or power
often both the voic doe not hold steadili and strictli to the
pitch and accord to the amount of the variat a correspond
vibrato or tremolo is produc
the action of string instrument illustr thi statement the
finger of the violinist vibrat on the string by rock rapidli back
and forth and the vibrato is the result
the same is true of the human instrument by variat of the tension
the vocal apparatu send forth sever tone in altern of a
slightli differ pitch which togeth produc the effect
three sourc ar ascrib for the vibrato on is a rapid spasmod
vibrat of the diaphragm caus variat of breath pressur
anoth is the altern tension and relax of the larynx and
vocal cord a third is that commonest of faultsthroat stiff
either caus is possibl and variat in the pitch or intens of
the tone is the result suffici investig have not been made
to make the matter certain but tremolo trembl of the vocal
organ and muscular stiff or unnatur tension seem to go
togeth
it is quit possibl in the earli stage of cultur so to train the
voic as to us the vibrato or not at will but if not earli
control thi like other bad habit gain the masteri excess
vibrato ha spoil mani good voic it is not a fundament qualiti
of the voic a littl vibrato mai occasion be desir when
properli and skilfulli us more than thi is to be shun as a
danger vice
chapter xi
the psycholog of vocal cultur
mental concept preced execut the pictur must exist in the
artist mind befor it can be drawn on the canva the architect must
mental see the majest cathedr in all it detail befor he can
draw the plan from which it can be built in the field of physic
activ no movement is made until the mind ha gone befor and
prepar the wai a person abil to do is in a great degre
measur by hi determin to do but sit in a rockingchair
and think will never make an athlet mental action is necessari
but onli through train muscular action can the mental action
materi in a finish perform
so too the mind must anticip the action of the vocal organ but
the organ themselv must be led to interpret the mental concept
until such action becom spontan action in turn quicken the
mental process and the mental pictur becom more vivid
note with emphasi that the mental concept preced the action and
govern it therefor instead of produc tone by local effort by
consciou muscular action of ani sort correctli think the tone
correctli shape and color it mental everi vocal tone is a mental
concept made audibl the beginn and the confirm bungler alik
fail in thi prime essentialthei do not make thi mental pictur of
tone befor sing it kindr to thi is defici in hear in
discrimin between good tone color and poor the student must
constantli compar hi tone as it is sung with the pictur in hi
mind train the voic is therefor larg a train of mind and
ear a develop of niceti in discrimin sing is mental
rather than physic psycholog rather than physiolog think
therefor of the effect desir rather than of the process
in consid the detail of voic product analyt we ar apt
to forget that man notwithstand hi complex is a unit and
act as a unit back of all and underli man vari activ is
the psychic in the advanc stage of the art of speech and song
thi psychic element is of preemin import
the speaker who essai to give express to hi own thought must
have hi idea sharpli defin and aflam in order to so utter them
that thei will arous hi hearer to enthusiasm the speaker or singer
who would successfulli interpret the thought of other must first
make those thought hi veri own when thi is attain then the
voic action and the whole spirit of the perform respond to
the theme will beget a like respons in hi audienc
the singer behind the voic
book upon book have been written on voic train and will
continu to be written the preced page have been devot to the
fundament subject of tone product but it is time to suggest that
back of the voic and the song is the singer himself with hi complex
person back of the person is the soul itself forev
seek utter through it mask of person all genuin impuls
to sing is from the soul in it need for express through
express come growth in soul conscious and desir for greater
and greater selfexpress
sing is far more than wind and muscl for as ffrangcondavi
put it the whole spiritu system spirit mind sens soul
togeth with the whole muscular system from feet to head will be in
the wise man sing and the whole man will be in the tone
of all the express of the human spirit in art form the sublim
speech we call song is the most direct everi other art requir some
materi medium for it transmiss and in music subtlest of all
the art instrument ar need except in sing onli
freedom
in song the singer himself is the instrument of free and direct
express freedom of express complet utter is prevent
onli by the singer himself no on hinder him no on stand in the
wai but himself the busi of the teacher is to set free that
which is latent hi high call is by wise guidanc to help the
singer to get out of hi own wai to ceas stand in front of
himself technic train is not all in all simpl recognit of
the exist of our power is need even more freedom come through
the recognit and appropri of inher power recognit come
first the appropri then follow simpli the novic doe not know
hi natur power hi birthright and must be help to find it
chiefli howev by help himself by cogniz and recogn
it
no student of the most human of all artssingingne give up if he
ha burn within him the song impuls the hunger to sing thi
inner impuls is by it strength an evid of the power to sing the
veri hunger is a promis and a propheci
deterr
the deterr to beauti sing ar physic in appear but
these ar outer sign of mental or emot disturb normal
pois which is strength smilingli express itself in curv in

all of these deterr ar neg and mai be overcom by fuller
