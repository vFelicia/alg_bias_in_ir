the histori of the mechan clock and the magnet compass must be
account amongst the most tortur of all our effort to understand the
origin of man import invent ignor ha too often been
replac by conjectur and conjectur by misquot and the fals
author of common knowledg engend by the repetit of
legendari histori from on gener of textbook to the next in
what follow i can onli hope that the ad of a strong new trail and
the erad of sever fals and weaker on will lead us nearer to
a balanc and integr understand of mediev invent and the
intercultur transmiss of idea
for the mechan clock perhap the greatest hindranc ha been it
treatment within a selfcontain histori of time measur in which
sundial waterclock and similar devic assum the natur role of
ancestor to the weightdriven escap clock in the earli 14th
century1 thi view must presum that a gener sophist
knowledg of gear anted the invent of the clock and extend
back to the classic period of hero and vitruviu and such author
wellknown for their mechan ingenu
furthermor even if on admit the us of clocklik gear befor the
exist of the clock it is still necessari to look for the
independ invent of the weightdriv and of the mechan
escap the first of these mai seem compar trivial anyon
familiar with the rais of heavi load by mean of rope and pullei
could sure recogn the possibl of us such an arrang in
revers as a sourc of steadi power nevertheless the us of thi
devic is not record befor it associ with hydraul and
perpetu motion machin in the manuscript of ridwan ca 1200
and it us in a clock us such a perpetu motion wheel mercuri
fill as a clock escap in the astronom codic of alfonso
the wise king of castil ca 1272
the second invent that of the mechan escap ha present
on of the most tantal of problem without doubt the crown and
foliot type of escap appear to be the first complic mechan
invent known to the european middl ag it herald our whole ag of
machinemak yet no trace ha been found either of a steadi evolut
of such escap or of their invent in europ though the
astronom clock power by a water wheel and govern by an
escapementlik devic had been elabor in china for sever
centuri befor the first appear of our clock we must now
rehears a revis stori of the origin of the clock as it ha been
suggest by recent research on the histori of gear and on chines
and other astronom machin after thi we shall for the first time
present evid to show that thi stori is curious relat to that of
the perpetuum mobil on of the great chimera of scienc that came
from it mediev origin to plai an import part in more recent
develop of energet and the foundat of thermodynamics2 it
is a curiou mixtur all the more so becaus tangl inextric in
it we shall find the most import and earliest refer to the us
of the magnet compass in the west it seem that in revis the
histori of clockwork and the magnet compass these consider
of perpetu motion devic mai provid some much need evid

thei were alreadi familiar to archimed born 287 bc3 and in

these machin gear wheel ar character by have a round number

a squar hole which fit without turn on a squar shaft anoth

that the finemechan us of gear to provid special ratio of

to adduc here the evid of the hodomet taximet describ by
vitruviu 1st centuri bc and by hero of alexandria 1st centuri

and hi islam followers6 on mai also cite the us of the reduct
gear chain in power machineri as us in the gear windlass of
archimed and hero
unfortun even the most complex automata describ by hero and by
such author as ridwan contain gear in no more extens context
than as a mean of transmit action around a right angl as for the
windlass and hodomet thei do it is true contain whole seri of
gear us in step as a reduct mechan usual for an
extraordinarili high ratio but here the technic detail ar so
etheri that on must doubt whether such devic were actual realiz
in practic thu vitruviu write of a wheel 4 feet in diamet and
have 400 teeth be turn by a 1tooth pinion on a cart axl but
it is veri doubt whether such small teeth necessarili separ by
about 38 inch would have the requisit rugged again hero
mention a wheel of 30 teeth which becaus of imperfect might need
onli 20 turn of a singl helix worm to turn it such statement behov
caution and on must consid whether we have been misl by the
16th and 17thcenturi edit of these author contain
reconstruct now often cite as authorit but then serv as
work diagram for practic us in that ag when the clock wa
alreadi a familiar and complex mechan at all event even if on
admit without substanti evid that such gear reduct devic
were familiar from hellenist time onward thei can hardli serv as
more than veri distant ancestor of the earliest mechan clock
mechan clock
befor proceed to a discuss of the controversi evid which
mai be us to bridg thi gap between the first us of gear and the
fullydevelop mechan clock we must examin the other side of thi
gap recent research on the histori of earli mechan clock ha
demonstr certain peculiar most relev to our present
argument
the european tradit
if on is to establish a terminu ant quem for the appear of the
mechan clock in europ it would appear that 1364 is a most
reason date at that time we have the veri full mechan and
histor materi concern the horolog masterpiec built by
giovanni de dondi of padua7 and probabl start as earli as 1348 it
might well be possibl to set a date a few decad earlier but in
gener as on proce backward from thi point the evid becom
increasingli fragmentari and uncertain the greatest sourc of doubt
aris from the confus between sundial waterclock handstruck
time bell and mechan clock all of which ar cover by the term
horologium and it vernacular equival
temporarili postpon the consider of evid prior to ca
1350 we mai take giovanni de dondi as a start point and trace a
virtual unbroken lineag from hi time to the present dai on mai
follow the spread of clock through europ from larg town to small
on from the richer cathedr and abbei to the less wealthi
churches8 there is the transit from the tower clocksshowpiec
of great institutionsto the simpl chamber clock design for domest
us and to the smaller portabl clock and still smaller and more
portabl pocket watch in mechan refin a similar continu
mai be note so that on see the cumul effect of the introduct
of the spring drive ca 1475 pendulum control ca 1650 and the
anchor escap ca 1680 the transit from de dondi to the
modern chronomet is inde basic continu and though much
research need to be done on special topic it ha an histor uniti
and seem to conform for the most part to the gener pattern of steadi
mechan improv found elsewher in the histori of technolog
illustr figur 3german wall clock probabl about 1450
show the degener in complex from that of de dondi clock
most remark howev is the earliest period of thi seemingli steadi
evolut side by side with the advanc made in the earliest period
extend for less than two centuri from the time of de dondi on mai
see a spectacular process of degener or devolut not onli is de
dondi the earliest clock of which we have a full and trustworthi
account it is also far more complic than ani other see fig 1 2
until compar modern time moreov it wa not an except
freak there were other like it and on cannot therefor reject as
accident thi process of degener that occur at the veri
begin of the certain histori of the mechan clock in europ
on the basi of such evid i have suggest elsewhere9 that the
clock is nought but a fallen angel from the world of astronomi the
first great clock of mediev europ were design as astronom
showpiec full of complic gear and dial to show the motion of
the sun moon and planet to exhibit eclips and to carri through the
involv comput of the ecclesiast calendar as such thei were
compar to the orreri of the 18th centuri and to modern
planetarium that thei also show the time and rang it on bell wa
almost incident to their main function on must not neglect too
that it wa in their glorif of the ration of the cosmo that
thei had their greatest effect through millenium of civil
man understand of celesti phenomena had been the veri pinnacl of
hi intellect and then as now popular exhibit of thi sort wa just
as necessari as strike and as impress on doe not have to go
far to see how the paraphernalia of these earli great astronom
clock had great influenc on philosoph and theologian and on poet
such as dant
it is the thesi of thi part of my argument that the ordinari
timetel clock is no affili of the other simpl timetel
devic such as sundial sand glass and the elementari water clock
rather it should be consid as a degener branch from the main stem
of mechan astronom devic i shall call them protoclock a
stem which can boast a continu histori fill the gap between the
appear of simpl gear and the complic of de dondi we shall
return to the discuss of thi main stem after analyz the veri
recent discov parallel stem from mediev china which reproduc
the same evolut of mechan astronom devic and incident
time tell of the greatest signific thi stem reveal the
crucial independ invent of a mechan escap a featur not
found in the european stem in spite of centuri of intens histor

for thi section i am privileg to draw upon a thrill research
project carri out in 1956 at the univers of cambridg by a team
consist of dr joseph needham dr wang ling and myself10 in the
cours of thi work we translat and comment on a seri of text
most of which had not hitherto been made avail in a western tongu
and though well known in china had not been recogn as import
for their horolog content the kei text with which we start wa
the hsin i hsiang fa yao or new design for a mechan armillari
sphere and celesti globe written by su sung in ad 1090 the
veri full histor and technic descript in thi text enabl us
to establish a glossari and basic understand of the mechan that
later enabl us to interpret a whole seri of similar though less
extens text give a histori of prior develop of such devic
go back to the introduct of thi type of escap by ihs and
liang lingtsan in ad 725 and to what seem to be the origin of
all these chines astronom machin that built by chang hng ca
ad 130 fill the gap between these landmark ar sever other
similar text give ampl evid that the chines develop is
continu and at least from chang hng onward larg independ of
ani transmiss from the west
so far as we can see the begin of the chain in china as inde in
the west wa the make of simpl static model of the celesti
sphere an armillari sphere wa us to repres the chief imaginari
circl eg equat eclipt meridian etc or a solid
celesti globe on which such circl could be drawn togeth with the
constel of the fix star the whole apparatu wa then mount
so that it wa free to revolv about it polar axi and anoth ring or
a case wa ad extern and fix to repres the horizon that
provid a datum for the rise and set of the sun and the star
in the next stage reach veri soon after thi the rotat of the
model wa arrang to proce automat instead of by hand thi wa
done we believ by us a slowli revolv wheel power by drip
water and turn the model through a reduct mechan probabl
involv gear or more reason a singl larg gear turn by a
trip lever it did not matter much that the timekeep properti were
poor in the long run the model move by itself and the great wonder
wa that it agre with the observ heaven like the two halv of a
talli
in the next and essenti stage the turn of the water wheel wa
regul by an escap mechan consist of a weighbridg and
trip lever so arrang that the wheel wa held in check scoop by
scoop while each scoop wa fill by the drip water then releas
by the weighbridg and allow to rotat until check again by the
triplev arrang it action wa similar to that of the anchor
escap though it period of repos wa much longer than it period
of motion and of cours it timekeep properti were control not
onli by the mechan of the devic but also by the rate of flow of the
drip water
the chines escap mai justifi be regard as a miss link
just halfwai between the elementari clepsydra with it steadi flow of
water and the mechan escap in which time is count by chop
it flow into cycl of action repeat indefinit and count by a
cumul devic with it characterist of save up energi for a
consider period about 15 minut befor let it go in on
power action the chines escap wa particularli suit to the
drive of jackwork and other demonstr devic requir much
energi but onli intermitt activ
in it final form as built by su sung after mani trial and
improv the chines astronom clocktow must have been a
most impress object it had the form of a tower about 30 feet high
surmount by an observ platform cover with a light roof see
fig 4 on the platform wa an armillari sphere design for observ
the heaven it wa turn by the clockwork so as to follow the diurnal
rotat and thu avoid the distress comput caus by the
chang of coordin necessari when fix altazimuth instrument were

automat rotat celesti globe which so wonderfulli agre with
the heaven below thi on the front of the tower wa a miniatur

moment appear jack who rang bell clang gong beat drum and
held tablet to announc the arriv of each hour each quarter thei
us 100 of them to the dai and each watch of the night within the
tower wa conceal the mechan it consist mainli of a central
vertic shaft provid power for the sphere globe and jackwheel
and a horizont shaft gear to the vertic on and carri the great
water wheel which seem to set itself magic in motion at everi
quarter in addit to all thi were the lever of the escap
mechan and a pair of noria by which onc each dai the water us
wa pump from a sump at the bottom to a reservoir at the top whenc
it descend to work the wheel by mean of a constant level tank and
sever channel
there were mani offshoot and develop of thi main stem of chines
horolog we ar told for exampl that often mercuri and occasion
sand were us to replac the water which frequent froze in winter in
spite of the applic of light brazier to the interior of the
machin then again the astronom model and the jackwork were
themselv subject to gradual improv at the time of ihs for
exampl special attent wa paid to the demarc of eclipt as
well as the normal equatori coordin thi wa clearli an influx
from hellenisticislam astronomi in which the rel
sophist planetari mathemat had forc thi chang not otherwis

the fact that the mediev chines escap mai have been the basi of

the chines for european clock should have prompt them to open their
door previous so carefulli and for so long kept close against the

howev quit evid an interpol from a later recens most
probabl that which establish the complet text as it now stand it

the siddhanta siromani is more certain for we know it wa
written in about 1150 by bhaskara born 1114 thu both these
passag must have been written within a centuri of the great clocktow
made by su sung the technic detail will lead us to suppos there is
more than a tempor connect
we have alreadi note that the armillari sphere and celesti globe
describ just befor these extract ar more similar in design to
chines than to ptolema practic the mention of mercuri and of sand
as altern to water for the clock fluid is anoth featur veri
preval in chines but absent in the greek text both text seem
consciou of the complex of these devic and there is a hint it is
lost and reveal that the stori ha been transmit onli half
understood from anoth ag or cultur it should also be note that
the mention of cord and string rather than gear and the us of
sphere rather than planispher would suggest we ar deal with
devic similar to the earliest greek model rather than the later
devic or with the chines practic
a quit new and import note is inject by the passag from the
bhaskara text obvious intrus in thi astronom text we have
the descript of two perpetu motion wheel togeth with a third
castig by the author which help it perpetu by let water
flow from a reservoir by mean of a syphon and drop into pot around the
circumfer of the wheel these seem to be the basi also in the
extract from the surya siddhanta of the wondercaus
instrument to which mercuri must be appli
in the next section we shall show that thi idea of a perpetu motion
devic occur again in conjunct with astronom model in islam and
shortli afterward in mediev europ at each occurr as here
there ar echo of other cultur in addit to those alreadi
mention we find the otherwis mysteri peacock man and monkei
cite as part of the jackwork of astronom clock of islam
associ with the weight drive so essenti to the later horolog in

we have alreadi seen that in classic time there were alreadi two
differ type of protoclock on which mai be term
nonmathemat design onli to give a visual aid in the concept
of the cosmo the other which mai be term mathemat in which
stereograph project or gear wa emploi to make the devic a
quantit rather than qualit represent these two line
occur again in the islam cultur area
nonmathemat protoclock which ar scarc remov from the
classic form appear continu through the byzantin era and in
islam as soon as it recov from the first shock of it format
procopiu di ca 535 describ a monument water clock which wa

been of the same type with automata and hydraul work for the
succeed few centuri islam wa in it golden ag of develop of
technic astronomi ca 9501150 and attent mai have been
concentr on the more mathemat protoclock toward the end of
the 12th centuri howev there wa a reviv of the old tradit
mainli at the court of the emperor saladin 11461173 when a great
automaton water clock more magnific than ani hitherto wa erect
in damascu it wa rebuilt after 1168 by muhammad b ali b

the center of graviti of islam astronomi shift from the east to the
hispanomoorish west at the same time there come more evid that
the line of mathemat protoclock had not been left unattend thi
is suggest by a descript given by trithemiu of anoth royal gift

castilian of the alfonsin libro del saber22 the section of thi
book deal with the lamina de la vii planeta describ not onli
thi instrument but also the improv modif introduc by
azarchiel born ca 1029 di ca 1087
no islam exampl of the equatorium have surviv but from thi
period onward there appear to have been a long and activ tradit of
them and ultim thei were transmit to the west along with the
rest of the alfonsin corpu more import for our argument is that
thei were the basi for the mechan astronom model of richard of
wallingford ca 1320 and probabl other and for the alreadi
mention great astronom clock of de dondi in fact the complic
gearwork and dial of de dondi clock constitut a seri of equatoria
mechan in just the same wai as the calendr devic describ by
biruni
it is evid that we ar come nearer now to the begin of the true
mechan clock and our last step also from the alfonsin corpu of
western islam provid us with an import link between the anaphor
clock the weight drive and a most curiou perpetualmot devic the
mercuri wheel us as an escap or regul the alfonsin book on

them must slowli filter through small hole in the constrain wall
in practic of cours the top mercuri surfac will not be level but

thi latter machin is a pump in which a chain of bucket is us to

those hitherto mention befor the influx of islam learn at the
time of transmiss of the toledo tabl 12th centuri and the
alfonsin tabl which reach pari ca 1292 there ar occasion

the most famou of these occur in an histor account by richer of

thu although there is a hint of mechan complex there is realli
no justif for such an assumpt the descript might well
impli onli a zodiac band on which the orbit of the planet were
paint on the other hand it is not inconceiv that gerbert could
have learn someth of islam and other extraeuropean tradit

devic like all the other in addit to thi instrument richard is
said to have construct ca 1320 a fine planetari clock for hi
abbey31 bale who seem to have seen it regard it as without rival
in europ and the greatest curios of hi time unfortun the
issu wa confus by leland who identifi it as the albion ie
allbi on the name richard give to hi manual equatorium thi clock
wa inde so complex that edward iii censur the abbot for spend so
much monei on it but richard repli that after hi death nobodi would
be abl to make such a thing again he is said to have left a text
describ the construct of thi clock but the absenc of such a
work ha led mani modern writer to support leland identif and
suppos that the devic wa not a mechan clock

a correct for thi view is to be had from a st alban manuscript
now at gonvil and caiu colleg cambridg that describ the
method for set out tooth wheel for an astronom horologium
design to show the motion of the planet although the manuscript
copi is to be date ca 1340 it clearli indic that a gear
planetari devic wa known in st alban at an earli date and it is
reason to suppos that thi wa in fact the machin made by richard
of wallingford unfortun the text doe not appear to give ani
relev inform about the presenc of an escap or ani other
regulatori devic nor doe it mention the sourc of power32 now a
gear version of the albion would appear to correspond veri close
inde to the dialwork which form the greater part of the de dondi
clock and for thi reason we suggest now that the two clock were veri
close relat in other wai too thi circumstanti though it be is
evid for think that the weight drive and some form of escap
were known to richard of wallingford ca 1320 it would narrow the
gap between the clock and the protoclock to less than half a centuri
perhap a singl gener in the interv ca 12851320 in thi
connect it mai be of interest that richard of wallingford knew onli
the toledo tabl corpu that of the alfonsin school did not arriv in
england until after hi death
there ar of cours mani literari refer to the waterclock in
mediev literatur in fact most of these ar from quotat which
have often been produc erron in the histori of the mechan
clock therebi provid mani mislead start for that histori as
note previous in the discuss of the horologium there ar howev
enough mention to make it certain that water clock of some sort were
in us especi for ecclesiast purpos from the end of the 12th
centuri onward thu jocelin of brakelond tell of a fire in the abbei
church of buri st edmund in the year 119833 the relic would have
been destroi dure the night but just at the crucial moment the
clock bell sound for matin and the master of the vestri sound the
alarm on thi the young men amongst us ran to get water some to the
well and other to the clockprob the sole occas on which a
clock serv as a fire hydrant
it seem probabl that some of these water clock could have been simpl
drip clepsydra with perhap a strike arrang ad a most
fortun discoveri by drover ha now brought to light a manuscript
illumin that show that these water clock at least by ca 1285
had becom more complex and were rather similar in appear to the
alfonsin mercuri drum34 the illustr fig 19 is from a
moral bibl written in northern franc and accompani the passag
where king hezekiah is given a sign by the lord the sun be move
back ten step of the clock the pictur clearli show the central water
wheel and below it a dog head spout gush water into a bucket
support by chain with a weight cord run behind abov the
wheel is a carillon of bell and to on side a rosett which might be a
fly or a model sun the wheel appear to have 15 compart each with
a central hole perhap similar to that in the alfonsin clock and it
is support on a squar axl by a bracket the axl be wedg in the
tradit fashion the project at the edg of the wheel might be
gear teeth but more like thei ar us onli for trip the strike
mechan if it were not for the run water spout it would be veri
close to the alfonsin model but with thi evid it seem imposs
to arriv at a clear mechan interpret
from the adjac region there is anoth account of a strike water
clock the evid be inscript on slate discov in viller
abbei near brussels35 these mai be close date as 1267 or 1268 and
provid the remain of a memorandum for the sacrist and hi assist

alwai set the clock howev long you mai delai on the

must do the same when you set the clock after complin
so that you mai sleep soundli
a quit differ sort of evid is to be had from the write of
robertu anglicu in 1271 where on get the impress that just at
thi time there wa activ interest in the attempt to make a
weightdriven anaphor clock and to regul it motion by some
unstat method so that it would keep time with the diurnal rotat of
the heavens36
nor it is possibl for ani clock to follow the judgment of
astronomi with complet accuraci yet clockmak
artific horologiorum ar try to make a wheel
circulum which will make on complet revolut for
everi on of the equinocti circl but thei cannot quit
perfect their work but if thei could it would be a
realli accur clock horologium verax vald and worth
more than an astrolab or other astronom instrument
for reckon the hour if on knew how to do thi
accord to the method aforesaid the method of make
such a clock would be thi that a man make a disc
circulum of uniform weight in everi part so far as could
possibl be done then a lead weight should be hung from
the axi of that wheel axi ipsiu rote and thi weight
would move that wheel so that it would complet on
revolut from sunris to sunris minu as much time as
about on degre rise accord to an approxim
correct estim for from sunris to sunris the whole
equinocti rise and about on degre more through
which degre the sun move against the motion of the
firmament in the cours of a natur dai moreov thi
could be done more accur if an astrolab were
construct with a network on which the entir equinocti

we have reserv to the last on section of evid which mai or mai
not be mislead the famou notebook of villard wilar of
honnecourt near cambrai the album attribut to the period 12401251
contain mani draw with short annot three of which ar of
special interest to our investigations37 these compris a steeplelik
structur label cest li mason don orolog thi is the hous of a
clock a devic includ a rope wheel and axl fig 20 mark par
chu fait om un angl tenir son doit ad ver le solel by thi mean
an angel is made to keep hi finger direct toward the sun and a
perpetu motion wheel which we shall reserv for later discuss
the clock tower accord to drover show no place for a dial but
suggest the us of bell becaus of it open structur suitabl for
let out the sound moreov he suggest that the delicaci of the
line indic that it wa not realli a fullsiz steepl but rather a
small towerlik structur stand onli a few feet high within the
church there is ala noth to tell us about the clock it wa
intend to hous most probabl it wa a water clock similar to that of
the illustr bibl of ca 1285
the draw of the rope wheel and axl for turn an angel to point
toward the sun can have a simpl explan or a more complic on
if taken at it face valu the wheel on it horizont axi act as a
windlass connect by the counterpois rope to the vertic shaft which
it turn therebi move by hand the figur of an angel not shown
fix to the top of thi latter shaft such an explan wa in fact
suggest by m quicherat38 who first call attent to the villard
album and point out that a leaden angel exist in chartr befor the
fire there in 1836 it is a view also support from anoth draw in
the album which describ an eagl whose head is made to turn toward
the deacon when he read the gospel slight pressur on the tail of the
bird caus a similar rope mechan to oper
a quit differ interpret ha been suggest by frmont39 he
believ that the wheel mai have act as a flywheel and the rope and
counterpois turn first on wai then the other act as a sort of
mechan escap such an arrang is howev mechan
imposs without some complic freewheel devic between the
drive and the escap and it onli effect would be to oscil the
angel rapidli rather than turn it steadili i believ that frmont
overanxi to provid a protoescap ha done too much violenc to
the fact and turn awai without good reason from the more simpl and
reason explan it is nevertheless still possibl to adopt thi
simpl interpret and yet to have the system as part of a clock if
the lefthand counterpois conveni rais higher than that on the
right is consid as a float fit into a clepsydra jar instead of
as a simpl weight on would have a veri suitabl automat system for
turn the angel on thi explan the purpos of the wheel would
be mere to provid the manual adjust necessari to set the angel
from time to time compens for irremedi inaccuraci of the
clepsydra
illustr figur 21villard perpetu motion wheel from lassu
see footnot 37
have discuss the villard draw which ar alreadi cite in
horolog literatur we must draw attent to the fact that thi
mediev architect also give an illustr of a perpetu motion
wheel in thi case fig 21 it is of the type have weight at the
end of swing arm a type that occur veri frequent at later date
in europ and is also given in the islam text we cannot in thi
case suggest that draw of clock and of perpetu motion devic
occur togeth by more than a coincid for villard seem to have
been interest in most sort of mechan devic but even thi type
of coincid becom somewhat strike when repeat often enough it
seem that each earli mention of selfmov wheel occur in
connect with some sort of clock or mechan astronom devic
have now complet a survei of the tradit of astronom model
we have seen that mani type of devic embodi featur later found in
mechan clock evolv through variou cultur and flow into
europ come togeth in a burst of multifari activ dure the
second half of the 13th centuri notabl in the region of franc we
must now attempt to fill the residu gap and in so do examin the
import of perpetu motion devic mechan and magnet in the
crucial transit from protoclock to mechanicalescap clock
perpetu motion and the clock befor de dondi
we have alreadi note more or less briefli sever instanc of the
us of wheel move by themselv or the us of a fluid for purpos
other than as a motiv power chronolog arrang these ar the
indian devic of ca 1150 or a littl earlier as those of ridwan
ca 1200 that of the alfonsin mercuri clock ca 1272 and the
french bibl illumin of ca 1285 thi strongli suggest a steadi
transmiss from east to west and on the basi of it we now
tent propos an addit step a transmiss from china to
india and perhap further west ca 1100 and possibl reinforc by
further transmiss at later date
on need onli assum the exist of vagu travel tale about the
exist of the 11thcenturi chines clock with their astronom
model and jackwork and with their great wheel appar move by
itself but us water have no extern inlet or outlet such a
stimulu act as it did on a later occas when galileo receiv
word of the invent of the telescop in the low countri might
easili lead to the reinvent of just such perpetualmot wheel as
we have alreadi note in mani wai onc the idea ha been suggest it
is natur to associ such a perpetu motion with the incess
diurnal rotat of the heaven without some such stimulu howev it
is difficult to explain why thi associ did not occur earlier and
why onc it come there seem to be such a chronolog process
from cultur to cultur
we now turn to what is undoubtedli the most curiou part of thi stori
in which automat move astronom model and perpetu motion
wheel ar link with the earliest text on magnet and the magnet
compass anoth subject with a singularli troubl histor origin
the kei text in thi is the famou epistl on the magnet written by
peter peregrinu a picard in an armi camp at the sieg of lucera and
date august 8 126940 in spite of the precis date it is certain
that the work wa done long befor for it is quot unmistak by
roger bacon in at least three place on of which must have been
written befor ca 125041
the epistl contain two part in the first there is a gener
account of magnet and the properti of the loadston close with a
discuss of the inquiri whenc the magnet receiv the natur virtu
which it ha peter attribut thi virtu to a sympathi with the
heaven propos to prove hi point by the construct of a
terrella a uniform sphere of loadston which is to be carefulli
balanc and mount in the manner of an armillari sphere with it axi
direct along the polar axi of the diurnal rotat he then
continu
now if the stone then move accord to the motion of the
heaven rejoic that you have arriv at a secret marvel
but if not let it be ascrib rather to your own want of
skill than to a defect of natur but in thi posit or
mode of place i deem the virtu of thi stone to be
properli conserv and i believ that in other posit
or part of the sky it virtu is dull rather than
preserv by mean of thi instrument at all event you
will be reliev from everi kind of clock horologium
for by it you will be abl to know the ascend at
whatev hour you will and all other disposit of the
heaven which astrolog seek after
it should be note that the devic is to be mount like an astronom
instrument and us like on rather than as a time teller or as a
simpl demonstr of magnet in the second part of the epistl
peter turn to practic instrument describ for the first time the
construct of a magnet compass consist of a loadston or iron
needl pivot with a case mark with a scale of degre the third
chapter of thi section conclud the epistl then continu with
the descript of a perpetu motion wheel elabour with marvel
ingenu in the pursuit of which invent i have seen mani peopl
wander about and weari with manifold toil for thei did not
observ that thei could arriv at the masteri of thi by mean of the
virtu or power of thi stone
thi tell us incident that the perpetu motion devic wa a
subject of consider interest at thi time42 oddli enough peter
doe not now develop hi idea of the terrella but proce to someth
quit new a devic see fig 22 in which a barmagnet loadston is to
be set toward the end of a pivot radial arm with a circl fit on
the insid with iron gear teeth the teeth be there not to mesh
with other but to draw the magnet from on to the next a littl bead
provid a counterweight to help the inertia of rotat carri the
magnet from on point of attract to the next it is by no mean the
sort of devic that on would natur evolv as a mean of make
magnet work perpetu and i suggest that the tooth wheel is
anoth instanc of some vagu idea of protoclock perhap that of su
sung be transmit from the east

the work of peter peregrinu is cite by roger bacon in hi de
secreti as well as in the opu maju and opu minu in the first
and earliest of these occur a descript taken from ptolemi of the
construct of the observ armillari sphere he sai that thi
cannot be made to move natur by ani mathemat devic but a
faith and magnific experimentor is strain to make on out of
such materi and by such a devic that it will revolv natur with
the diurnal heavenli rotat he continu with the statement that
thi possibl is also suggest by the fact that the motion of
comet of tide and of certain planet also follow that of the sun and
of the heaven onli in the opu minu where he repeat refer to
thi devic doe he final reveal that it is to be made to work by
mean of the loadston
the form of bacon refer to peregrinu is strongli reminisc of
the statement by robertu anglicu alreadi mention as an indic
of preoccup with diurnal rotat wheel at a date 1271
remark close to that of the epistl 1269so much so that it
could well be thought that the friend to which peter wa write wa
either robert himself or somebodi associ with him perhap at the
univers of parisa natur place to which the itiner peter might
commun hi find
the fundament question here of cours is whether the idea of an
automat astronom devic wa transmit from arab indian or
chines sourc or whether it aros quit independ in thi case as
a natur concomit of identifi the pole of the magnet with the
pole of the heaven we shall now attempt to show that the histori of
the magnet compass might provid a quit independ argument in
favour of the hypothesi that there wa a stimulu transmiss
the magnet compass as a fellowtravel from china
the elus histori of the magnet compass ha mani point in common
with that of the mechan clock just as we have astronom model
from the earliest time so we find knowledg of the loadston and some
of it properti then parallel to the develop of protoclock in
china throughout the middl ag we have the evid analyz by
needham show the us of the magnet as a divinatori devic and of the
nonmagnet southpoint chariot which ha been confusedli alli
to the stori curious and perhap significantli the chines histori
come to a head at just the same time for compass and clock and a
prime author for the chines compass is shen kua 10301093 who also
appear in connect with the clock of su sung and who wrote about the
mechan armillari sphere and other model ca 1086
anoth similar occur in connect with the histori of the compass
in mediev europ the treatis of peter peregrinu alreadi discuss
provid the first complet account of the magnet compass with a
pivot needl and a circular scale and thi as we have seen mai be
connect with protoclock and perpetualmot devic there ar
sever earlier refer howev to the us of the direct
properti of loadston mainli for us in navig but these
earliest text have a long histori of erron interpret which is
onli recent be clear awai we know now that the famou passag
in the de naturi rerum and de utensilibu of alexand neckham43
ca 1187 and a text by hugu de berze44 after ca 1204 refer
to noth more than a float magnet without pivot or scale but us
a pointer at right angl to the magnet so that it point to the east
rather than the north or south a similar method is describ ca
1200 in a poem by guyot de provin and in a histori of jerusalem by
jacqu de vitri 121545 it is of the greatest interest that onc
more all the evid seem to be concentr in franc neckham wa
teach in pari though at an earlier period than that for the
protoclock
the date might suggest the time of the first great wave of transmiss
of learn from islam but it is clear that in thi instanc peculiar
for that reason that islam learn of the magnet compass onli after
it wa alreadi known in the west in the earliest persian record some
anecdot compil by alawfii ca 123046 the instrument us
by the captain dure a storm at sea ha the form of a piec of hollow
iron shape like a fish and made to float on the water after
magnet by rub with a loadston the fishlik form is veri
signific for thi is distinctli chines practic in a second muslim
refer that of bailak alqabajaqi ca 1282 the ordinari

there is therefor reason ground for support the mediev
european tradit that the magnet compass had first come from china
though on cannot well admit that the first new of it wa brought as
the legend state by marco polo when he return home in 1260 there
might well have been anoth wave of interest give the impetu to
peter peregrinu at thi time but an earlier transmiss perhap
along the silk road or by travel in crusad must be postul to
account for the evid in europ ca 1200 the earlier influx doe
not plai ani great part in our main stori it arriv in europ befor
the transmiss of astronomi from islam had got under wai suffici
to make protoclock a subject of interest for a second transmiss we
have alreadi seen how the relev text seem to cluster in franc
ca 1270 around a complex in which the protoclock seem combin with
the idea of perpetu motion wheel and with new inform about the
magnet compass
the point of thi paper is that such a complex exist cut across
the histori of the clock the variou type of astronom machin
and the magnet compass and includ the origin of selfmov
