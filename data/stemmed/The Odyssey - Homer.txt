thi translat is intend to supplement a work entitl the
authoress of the odyssei which i publish in 1897 i could not give
the whole odyssei in that book without make it unwieldi i
therefor epitomis my translat which wa alreadi complet and
which i now publish in full
i shall not here argu the two main point dealt with in the work just
mention i have noth either to add to or to withdraw from what i
have there written the point in question ar
1 that the odyssei wa written entir at and drawn entir
from the place now call trapani on the west coast of sicili alik
as regard the phaeacian and the ithaca scene while the voyag of
ulyss when onc he is within easi reach of sicili solv themselv
into a periplu of the island practic from trapani back to
trapani via the lipari island the strait of messina and the island
of pantellaria
2 that the poem wa entir written by a veri young woman who live
at the place now call trapani and introduc herself into her work
under the name of nausicaa
the main argument on which i base the first of these somewhat
startl content have been promin and repeatedli befor the
english and italian public ever sinc thei appear without rejoind
in the athenaeum for januari 30 and februari 20 1892 both
content were urg also without rejoind in the johnian eagl
for the lent and octob term of the same year noth to which i
should repli ha reach me from ani quarter and know how anxious
i have endeavour to learn the exist of ani flaw in my argument
i begin to feel some confid that did such flaw exist i should
have heard at ani rate about some of them befor now without
therefor for a moment pretend to think that scholar gener
acquiesc in my conclus i shall act as think them littl like
so to gainsai me as that it will be incumb upon me to repli and
shall confin myself to translat the odyssei for english reader
with such note as i think will be found us among these i would
especi call attent to on on xxii 465473 which lord grimthorp
ha kindli allow me to make public
i have repeat sever of the illustr us in the authoress of
the odyssei and have ad two which i hope mai bring the outer court
of ulyss hous more vividli befor the reader i should like to
explain that the presenc of a man and a dog in on illustr is
accident and wa not observ by me till i develop the neg
in an appendix i have also reprint the paragraph explanatori of the
plan of ulyss hous togeth with the plan itself the reader is
recommend to studi thi plan with some attent
in the prefac to my translat of the iliad i have given my view
as to the main principl by which a translat should be guid and
need not repeat them here beyond point out that the initi liberti
of translat poetri into prose involv the continu take of more
or less liberti throughout the translat for much that is right in
poetri is wrong in prose and the exig of readabl prose ar the
first thing to be consid in a prose translat that the reader
howev mai see how far i have depart from strict constru i will
print here messr butcher and lang translat of the sixti line or
so of the odyssei their translat run
tell me muse of that man so readi at need who wander far and
wide after he had sack the sacr citadel of troi and mani were the
men whose town he saw and whose mind he learnt yea and mani the woe
he suffer in hi heart on the deep strive to win hi own life and
the return of hi compani nai but even so he save not hi compani
though he desir it sore for through the blind of their own
heart thei perish fool who devour the oxen of helio hyperion
but the god took from them their dai of return of these thing
goddess daughter of zeu whencesoev thou hast heard thereof
declar thou even unto us
now all the rest as mani as fled from sheer destruct were at
home and had escap both war and sea but odysseu onli crave
for hi wife and for hi homeward path the ladi nymph calypso
held that fair goddess in her hollow cave long to have him
for her lord but when now the year had come in the cours of the
season wherein the god had ordain that he should return home
to ithaca not even there wa he quit of labour not even among
hi own but all the god had piti on him save poseidon who rage
continu against godlik odysseu till he came to hi own
countri howbeit poseidon had now depart for the distant
ethiopian the ethiopian that ar sunder in twain the
uttermost of men abid some where hyperion sink and some where
he rise there he look to receiv hi hecatomb of bull and
ram there he made merri sit at the feast but the other god
were gather in the hall of olympian zeu then among them the
father of men and god began to speak for he bethought him in hi
heart of nobl aegisthu whom the son of agamemnon farfam
orest slew think upon him he spake out among the immort
lo you now how vainli mortal men do blame the god for of us
thei sai come evil wherea thei even of themselv through the
blind of their own heart have sorrow beyond that which is
ordain even as of late aegisthu beyond that which wa
ordain took to him the wed wife of the son of atreu and
kill her lord on hi return and that with sheer doom befor hi
ey sinc we had warn him by the embassi of herm the
keensight the slayer of argo that he should neither kill the
man nor woo hi wife for the son of atreu shall be aveng at
the hand of orest so soon as he shall come to man estat and
long for hi own countri so spake herm yet he prevail not on
the heart of aegisthu for all hi good will but now hath he paid
on price for all
and the goddess greyei athen answer him sai o father
our father cronid throne in the highest that man assuredli
li in a death that is hi due so perish likewis all who work
such deed but my heart is rent for wise odysseu the hapless
on who far from hi friend thi long while suffereth afflict
in a seagirt isl where is the navel of the sea a woodland isl
and therein a goddess hath her habit the daughter of the
wizard atla who know the depth of everi sea and himself
uphold the tall pillar which keep earth and sky asund hi
daughter it is that hold the hapless man in sorrow and ever with
soft and guil tale she is woo him to forget of
ithaca but odysseu yearn to see if it were but the smoke leap
upward from hi own land hath a desir to die as for thee thine
heart regardeth it not at all olympian what did not odysseu by
the ship of the argiv make thee free offer of sacrific in
the wide trojan land wherefor wast thou then so wroth with him o
zeu
the odyssei as everi on know abound in passag borrow from
the iliad i had wish to print these in a slightli differ type
with margin refer to the iliad and had mark them to thi
end in my ms i found howev that the translat would be thu
hopelessli scholasticis and abandon my intent i would
nevertheless urg on those who have the manag of our univers
press that thei would render a great servic to student if thei
would publish a greek text of the odyssei with the iliad passag
print in a differ type and with margin refer i have given
the british museum a copi of the odyssei with the iliad passag
underlin and refer to in ms i have also given an iliad mark
with all the odyssean passag and their refer but copi of
both the iliad and odyssei so mark ought to be within easi reach
of all student
ani on who at the present dai discuss the question that have arisen
round the iliad sinc wolf time without keep it well befor hi
reader mind that the odyssei wa demonstr written from on
singl neighbourhood and henc even though noth els point to
thi conclus presum by on person onlythat it wa written
certainli befor 750 and in all probabl befor 1000 bcthat the
writer of thi veri earli poem wa demonstr familiar with the
iliad as we now have it borrow as freeli from those book whose
genuin ha been most impugn as from those which ar admit to
be by homerani on who fail to keep these point befor hi reader
is hardli deal equit by them ani on on the other hand who
will mark hi iliad and hi odyssei from the copi in the british
museum abov refer to and who will draw the onli infer that
common sens can draw from the presenc of so mani ident passag
in both poem will i believ find no difficulti in assign their
proper valu to a larg number of book here and on the contin that
at present enjoi consider reput furthermor and thi
perhap is an advantag better worth secur he will find that mani
puzzl of the odyssei ceas to puzzl him on the discoveri that thei
aris from oversatur with the iliad
other difficulti will also disappear as soon as the develop of
the poem in the writer mind is understood i have dealt with thi at
some length in pp 251261 of the authoress of the odyssei briefli
the odyssei consist of two distinct poem 1 the return of
ulyss which alon the muse is ask to sing in the open line of
the poem thi poem includ the phaeacian episod and the account of
ulyss adventur as told by himself in book ixxii it consist of
line 179 roughli of book i of line 28 of book v and thenc
without intermiss to the middl of line 187 of book xiii at which
point the origin scheme wa abandon
2 the stori of penelop and the suitor with the episod of
telemachu voyag to pylo thi poem begin with line 80 roughli of
book i is continu to the end of book iv and not resum till
ulyss wake in the middl of line 187 book xiii from whenc it
continu to the end of book xxiv
in the authoress of the odyssei i wrote
the introduct of line xi 115137 and of line ix 535 with the
write a new council of the god at the begin of book v to take
the place of the on that wa remov to book i 179 were the onli
thing that were done to give even a semblanc of uniti to the old
scheme and the new and to conceal the fact that the muse after be
ask to sing of on subject spend twothird of her time in sing a
veri differ on with a climax for which noon ha ask her for
roughli the return occupi eight book and penelop and the suitor
sixteen
i believ thi to be substanti correct
lastli to deal with a veri unimport point i observ that the
leipsic teubner edit of 894 make book ii and iii end with a
comma stop ar thing of such far more recent date than the
odyssei that there doe not seem much us in adher to the text in
so small a matter still from a spirit of mere conservat i have
prefer to do so why greek at the begin of book ii and
viii and greek at the begin of book vii should have initi
capit in an edit far too care to admit a supposit of
inadvert when greek at the begin of book vi and xiii and
greek at the begin of book xvii have no initi capit i
cannot determin no other book of the odyssei have initi capit
except the three mention unless the first word of the book is a
proper name

the authoress of the odyssei in 1897 in the prefac to the new edit
of the authoress which is publish simultan with thi new
edit of the translat i have given some account of the genesi of
the two book
the size of the origin page ha been reduc so as to make both book
uniform with butler other work and fortun it ha been
possibl by us a smaller type to get the same number of word into
each page so that the refer remain good and with the except
of a few minor alter and rearrang now to be enumer so
far as thei affect the translat the new edit ar faith
reprint of the origin edit with misprint and obviou error
correctedno attempt have been made to edit them or to bring them up
to date
a the index ha been revis
b ow to the reduct in the size of the page it ha been
necessari to shorten some of the headlin and here advantag ha been
taken of variou correct of and addit to the headlin and
shouldernot made by butler in hi own copi of the two book
c for the most part each of the illustr now occupi a page
wherea in the origin edit thei gener appear two on the
page it ha been necessari to reduc the plan of the hous of ulyss
on page 153 of the authoress butler sai no great poet would
compar hi hero to a paunch full of blood and fat cook befor the
fire xx 2428 thi passag is not given in the abridg stori of
the odyssei at the begin of the book but in the translat it
occur in these word
thu he chide with hi heart and check it into endur but he
toss about as on who turn a paunch full of blood and fat in front
of a hot fire do it first on on side then on the other that he
mai get it cook as soon as possibl even so did he turn himself
about from side to side think all the time how singlehand as he
wa he should contriv to kill so larg a bodi of men as the wick
suitor
it look as though in the interv between the public of the
authoress 1897 and of the translat 1900 butler had chang hi
mind for in the first case the comparison is between ulyss and a
paunch full etc and in the second it is between ulyss and a man
who turn a paunch full etc the second comparison is perhap on
which a great poet might make
in see the work through the press i have had the invalu
assist of mr a t bartholomew of the univers librari
cambridg and of mr donald s robertson fellow of triniti colleg
cambridg to both these friend i give my most cordial thank for the
care and skill exercis by them mr robertson ha found time for the
labour of check and correct all the quotat from and
refer to the iliad and odyssei and i believ that it could
not have been better perform it wa i know a pleasur for him and
it would have been a pleasur also for butler if he could have known
that hi work wa be shepherd by the son of hi old friend mr h

the god in councilminerva visit to ithacath challeng from
telemachu to the suitor
tell me o muse of that ingeni hero who travel far and wide
after he had sack the famou town of troi mani citi did he visit
and mani were the nation with whose manner and custom he wa
acquaint moreov he suffer much by sea while try to save hi
own life and bring hi men safe home but do what he might he could
not save hi men for thei perish through their own sheer folli in
eat the cattl of the sungod hyperion so the god prevent them
from ever reach home tell me too about all these thing oh
daughter of jove from whatsoev sourc you mai know them
so now all who escap death in battl or by shipwreck had got safe
home except ulyss and he though he wa long to return to hi
wife and countri wa detain by the goddess calypso who had got him
into a larg cave and want to marri him but as year went by there
came a time when the god settl that he should go back to ithaca
even then howev when he wa among hi own peopl hi troubl were
not yet over nevertheless all the god had now begun to piti him
except neptun who still persecut him without ceas and would not
let him get home
now neptun had gone off to the ethiopian who ar at the world end
and lie in two halv the on look west and the other east1 he had
gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen and wa enjoi
himself at hi festiv but the other god met in the hous of
olympian jove and the sire of god and men spoke first at that moment
he wa think of aegisthu who had been kill by agamemnon son
orest so he said to the other god
see now how men lai blame upon us god for what is after all noth
but their own folli look at aegisthu he must need make love to
agamemnon wife unright and then kill agamemnon though he knew
it would be the death of him for i sent mercuri to warn him not to do
either of these thing inasmuch as orest would be sure to take hi
reveng when he grew up and want to return home mercuri told him
thi in all good will but he would not listen and now he ha paid for
everyth in full
then minerva said father son of saturn king of king it serv
aegisthu right and so it would ani on els who doe as he did but
aegisthu is neither here nor there it is for ulyss that my heart
bleed when i think of hi suffer in that lone seagirt island
far awai poor man from all hi friend it is an island cover with
forest in the veri middl of the sea and a goddess live there
daughter of the magician atla who look after the bottom of the
ocean and carri the great column that keep heaven and earth
asund thi daughter of atla ha got hold of poor unhappi ulyss
and keep try by everi kind of blandish to make him forget hi
home so that he is tire of life and think of noth but how he mai
onc more see the smoke of hi own chimnei you sir take no heed of
thi and yet when ulyss wa befor troi did he not propiti you
with mani a burnt sacrific why then should you keep on be so angri
with him
and jove said my child what ar you talk about how can i forget
ulyss than whom there is no more capabl man on earth nor more
liber in hi offer to the immort god that live in heaven bear
in mind howev that neptun is still furiou with ulyss for have
blind an ey of polyphemu king of the cyclop polyphemu is son to
neptun by the nymph thoosa daughter to the seak phorci
therefor though he will not kill ulyss outright he torment him by
prevent him from get home still let us lai our head togeth
and see how we can help him to return neptun will then be pacifi
for if we ar all of a mind he can hardli stand out against us
and minerva said father son of saturn king of king if then the
god now mean that ulyss should get home we should first send
mercuri to the ogygian island to tell calypso that we have made up our
mind and that he is to return in the meantim i will go to ithaca to
put heart into ulyss son telemachu i will embolden him to call the
achaean in assembl and speak out to the suitor of hi mother
penelop who persist in eat up ani number of hi sheep and oxen i
will also conduct him to sparta and to pylo to see if he can hear
anyth about the return of hi dear fatherfor thi will make peopl
speak well of him
so sai she bound on her glitter golden sandal imperish
with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea she grasp the
redoubt bronzeshod spear so stout and sturdi and strong
wherewith she quell the rank of hero who have displeas her and
down she dart from the topmost summit of olympu whereon forthwith
she wa in ithaca at the gatewai of ulyss hous disguis as a
visitor ment chief of the taphian and she held a bronz spear in
her hand there she found the lordli suitor seat on hide of the
oxen which thei had kill and eaten and plai draught in front of
the hous menserv and page were bustl about to wait upon
them some mix wine with water in the mixingbowl some clean
down the tabl with wet spong and lai them out again and some
cut up great quantiti of meat
telemachu saw her long befor ani on els did he wa sit moodili
among the suitor think about hi brave father and how he would
send them fly out of the hous if he were to come to hi own again
and be honour as in dai gone by thu brood as he sat among them
he caught sight of minerva and went straight to the gate for he wa
vex that a stranger should be kept wait for admitt he took
her right hand in hi own and bade her give him her spear welcom
said he to our hous and when you have partaken of food you shall
tell us what you have come for
he led the wai as he spoke and minerva follow him when thei were
within he took her spear and set it in the spearstand against a strong
bearingpost along with the mani other spear of hi unhappi father
and he conduct her to a richli decor seat under which he threw a
cloth of damask there wa a footstool also for her feet2 and he set
anoth seat near her for himself awai from the suitor that she
might not be annoi while eat by their nois and insol and
that he might ask her more freeli about hi father
a maid servant then brought them water in a beauti golden ewer and
pour it into a silver basin for them to wash their hand and she
drew a clean tabl besid them an upper servant brought them bread
and offer them mani good thing of what there wa in the hous the
carver fetch them plate of all manner of meat and set cup of gold
by their side and a manserv brought them wine and pour it out for

then the suitor came in and took their place on the bench and
seats3 forthwith men servant pour water over their hand maid
went round with the breadbasket page fill the mixingbowl with
wine and water and thei laid their hand upon the good thing that
were befor them as soon as thei had had enough to eat and drink thei
want music and danc which ar the crown embellish of a
banquet so a servant brought a lyre to phemiu whom thei compel
perforc to sing to them as soon as he touch hi lyre and began to
sing telemachu spoke low to minerva with hi head close to her that
no man might hear
i hope sir said he that you will not be offend with what i am
go to sai sing come cheap to those who do not pai for it and
all thi is done at the cost of on whose bone lie rot in some
wilder or grind to powder in the surf if these men were to see
my father come back to ithaca thei would prai for longer leg rather
than a longer purs for monei would not serv them but he ala ha
fallen on an ill fate and even when peopl do sometim sai that he is
come we no longer heed them we shall never see him again and now
sir tell me and tell me true who you ar and where you come from
tell me of your town and parent what manner of ship you came in how
your crew brought you to ithaca and of what nation thei declar
themselv to befor you cannot have come by land tell me also truli
for i want to know ar you a stranger to thi hous or have you been
here in my father time in the old dai we had mani visitor for my
father went about much himself
and minerva answer i will tell you truli and particularli all about
it i am ment son of anchialu and i am king of the taphian i
have come here with my ship and crew on a voyag to men of a foreign
tongu be bound for temesa4 with a cargo of iron and i shall bring
back copper as for my ship it li over yonder off the open countri
awai from the town in the harbour rheithron5 under the wood mountain
neritum6 our father were friend befor us as old laert will tell
you if you will go and ask him thei sai howev that he never come
to town now and live by himself in the countri fare hardli with
an old woman to look after him and get hi dinner for him when he
come in tire from potter about hi vineyard thei told me your
father wa at home again and that wa why i came but it seem the
god ar still keep him back for he is not dead yet not on the
mainland it is more like he is on some seagirt island in mid ocean
or a prison among savag who ar detain him against hi will i
am no prophet and know veri littl about omen but i speak as it is
born in upon me from heaven and assur you that he will not be awai
much longer for he is a man of such resourc that even though he were
in chain of iron he would find some mean of get home again but
tell me and tell me true can ulyss realli have such a fine look
fellow for a son you ar inde wonderfulli like him about the head
and ey for we were close friend befor he set sail for troi where
the flower of all the argiv went also sinc that time we have never
either of us seen the other
my mother answer telemachu tell me i am son to ulyss but it
is a wise child that know hi own father would that i were son to on
who had grown old upon hi own estat for sinc you ask me there is
no more illstar man under heaven than he who thei tell me is my
father
and minerva said there is no fear of your race dy out yet while
penelop ha such a fine son as you ar but tell me and tell me true
what is the mean of all thi feast and who ar these peopl
what is it all about have you some banquet or is there a wed in
the familyfor no on seem to be bring ani provis of hi own
and the guestshow atroci thei ar behav what riot thei make
over the whole hous it is enough to disgust ani respect person
who come near them
sir said telemachu as regard your question so long as my father
wa here it wa well with us and with the hous but the god in their
displeasur have will it otherwis and have hidden him awai more
close than mortal man wa ever yet hidden i could have born it
better even though he were dead if he had fallen with hi men befor
troi or had di with friend around him when the dai of hi fight
were done for then the achaean would have built a mound over hi
ash and i should myself have been heir to hi renown but now the
stormwind have spirit him awai we know not whither he is gone
without leav so much as a trace behind him and i inherit noth
but dismai nor doe the matter end simpli with grief for the loss of
my father heaven ha laid sorrow upon me of yet anoth kind for the
chief from all our island dulichium same and the woodland island
of zacynthu as also all the princip men of ithaca itself ar
eat up my hous under the pretext of pai their court to my
mother who will neither point blank sai that she will not marry7 nor
yet bring matter to an end so thei ar make havoc of my estat and
befor long will do so also with myself
is that so exclaim minerva then you do inde want ulyss home
again give him hi helmet shield and a coupl of lanc and if he
is the man he wa when i first knew him in our hous drink and
make merri he would soon lai hi hand about these rascal suitor
were he to stand onc more upon hi own threshold he wa then come
from ephyra where he had been to beg poison for hi arrow from ilu
son of mermeru ilu fear the everliv god and would not give
him ani but my father let him have some for he wa veri fond of him
if ulyss is the man he then wa these suitor will have a short
shrift and a sorri wed
but there it rest with heaven to determin whether he is to return
and take hi reveng in hi own hous or no i would howev urg you
to set about try to get rid of these suitor at onc take my
advic call the achaean hero in assembl tomorrow morninglai your
case befor them and call heaven to bear you wit bid the suitor
take themselv off each to hi own place and if your mother mind
is set on marri again let her go back to her father who will find
her a husband and provid her with all the marriag gift that so dear
a daughter mai expect as for yourself let me prevail upon you to take
the best ship you can get with a crew of twenti men and go in quest
of your father who ha so long been miss some on mai tell you
someth or and peopl often hear thing in thi wai some

anoth twelv month if on the other hand you hear of hi death come

hi father he felt the chang wonder at it and knew that the
stranger had been a god so he went straight to where the suitor were

land of nobl steed but the savag cyclop had kill him when thei

there ha been no meet of our councillor until now who then can it
be whether old or young that find it so necessari to conven us ha
he got wind of some host approach and doe he wish to warn us or
would he speak upon some other matter of public moment i am sure he is
an excel person and i hope jove will grant him hi heart
desir
telemachu took thi speech as of good omen and rose at onc for he
wa burst with what he had to sai he stood in the middl of the
assembl and the good herald pisenor brought him hi staff then
turn to aegyptiu sir said he it is i as you will shortli
learn who have conven you for it is i who am the most aggriev i
have not got wind of ani host approach about which i would warn you
nor is there ani matter of public moment on which i would speak my
grievanc is pure person and turn on two great misfortun which
have fallen upon my hous the first of these is the loss of my
excel father who wa chief among all you here present and wa
like a father to everi on of you the second is much more seriou and
er long will be the utter ruin of my estat the son of all the chief
men among you ar pester my mother to marri them against her will
thei ar afraid to go to her father icariu ask him to choos the
on he like best and to provid marriag gift for hi daughter but
dai by dai thei keep hang about my father hous sacrif our
oxen sheep and fat goat for their banquet and never give so much
as a thought to the quantiti of wine thei drink no estat can stand
such reckless we have now no ulyss to ward off harm from our

the god should be displeas and turn upon you i prai you by jove and
themi who is the begin and the end of council do not hold
back my friend and leav me singlehanded18unless it be that my
brave father ulyss did some wrong to the achaean which you would now
aveng on me by aid and abet these suitor moreov if i am
to be eaten out of hous and home at all i had rather you did the
eat yourselv for i could then take action against you to some
purpos and serv you with notic from hous to hous till i got paid
in full wherea now i have no remedy19
with thi telemachu dash hi staff to the ground and burst into
tear everi on wa veri sorri for him but thei all sat still and no
on ventur to make him an angri answer save onli antin who spoke
thu
telemachu insol braggart that you ar how dare you try to throw
the blame upon us suitor it is your mother fault not our for she
is a veri art woman thi three year past and close on four she
had been drive us out of our mind by encourag each on of us
and send him messag without mean on word of what she sai and
then there wa that other trick she plai us she set up a great
tambour frame in her room and began to work on an enorm piec of
fine needlework sweet heart said she ulyss is inde dead
still do not press me to marri again immedi waitfor i would not
have skill in needlework perish unrecordedtil i have complet a pall
for the hero laert to be in readi against the time when death
shall take him he is veri rich and the women of the place will talk
if he is laid out without a pall
thi wa what she said and we assent whereon we could see her
work on her great web all dai long but at night she would unpick
the stitch again by torchlight she fool us in thi wai for three
year and we never found her out but as time wore on and she wa now
in her fourth year on of her maid who knew what she wa do told
us and we caught her in the act of undo her work so she had to
finish it whether she would or no the suitor therefor make you
thi answer that both you and the achaean mai understandsend your
mother awai and bid her marri the man of her own and of her father
choic for i do not know what will happen if she goe on plagu us
much longer with the air she give herself on the score of the
accomplish minerva ha taught her and becaus she is so clever
we never yet heard of such a woman we know all about tyro alcmena
mycen and the famou women of old but thei were noth to your
mother ani on of them it wa not fair of her to treat us in that wai
and as long as she continu in the mind with which heaven ha now
endow her so long shall we go on eat up your estat and i do not
see why she should chang for she get all the honour and glori and
it is you who pai for it not she understand then that we will not
go back to our land neither here nor elsewher till she ha made her
choic and marri some on or other of us
telemachu answer antin how can i drive the mother who bore me
from my father hous my father is abroad and we do not know whether
he is aliv or dead it will be hard on me if i have to pai icariu the
larg sum which i must give him if i insist on send hi daughter
back to him not onli will he deal rigor with me but heaven will
also punish me for my mother when she leav the hous will call on
the eriny to aveng her besid it would not be a credit thing
to do and i will have noth to sai to it if you choos to take
offenc at thi leav the hous and feast elsewher at on anoth
hous at your own cost turn and turn about if on the other hand you
elect to persist in spung upon on man heaven help me but jove
shall reckon with you in full and when you fall in my father hous
there shall be no man to aveng you
as he spoke jove sent two eagl from the top of the mountain and thei
flew on and on with the wind sail side by side in their own lordli
flight when thei were right over the middl of the assembl thei
wheel and circl about beat the air with their wing and glare
death into the ey of them that were below then fight fierc
and tear at on anoth thei flew off toward the right over the
town the peopl wonder as thei saw them and ask each other what
all thi might be whereon halithers who wa the best prophet and
reader of omen among them spoke to them plainli and in all honesti
sai
hear me men of ithaca and i speak more particularli to the suitor
for i see mischief brew for them ulyss is not go to be awai
much longer inde he is close at hand to deal out death and
destruct not on them alon but on mani anoth of us who live in
ithaca let us then be wise in time and put a stop to thi wicked
befor he come let the suitor do so of their own accord it will be
better for them for i am not prophesi without due knowledg
everyth ha happen to ulyss as i foretold when the argiv set
out for troi and he with them i said that after go through much
hardship and lose all hi men he should come home again in the
twentieth year and that no on would know him and now all thi is
come true
eurymachu son of polybu then said go home old man and prophesi to
your own children or it mai be wors for them i can read these omen
myself much better than you can bird ar alwai fly about in the
sunshin somewher or other but thei seldom mean anyth ulyss ha
di in a far countri and it is a piti you ar not dead along with
him instead of prate here about omen and ad fuel to the anger
of telemachu which is fierc enough as it is i suppos you think he
will give you someth for your famili but i tell youand it shall
sure bewhen an old man like you who should know better talk a
young on over till he becom troublesom in the first place hi
young friend will onli fare so much the worseh will take noth by
it for the suitor will prevent thisand in the next we will lai a
heavier fine sir upon yourself than you will at all like pai for
it will bear hardli upon you as for telemachu i warn him in the
presenc of you all to send hi mother back to her father who will
find her a husband and provid her with all the marriag gift so dear
a daughter mai expect till then we shall go on harass him with our
suit for we fear no man and care neither for him with all hi fine
speech nor for ani fortunetel of your you mai preach as much
as you pleas but we shall onli hate you the more we shall go back
and continu to eat up telemachuss estat without pai him till
such time as hi mother leav off torment us by keep us dai
after dai on the tipto of expect each vy with the other in
hi suit for a prize of such rare perfect besid we cannot go
after the other women whom we should marri in due cours but for the
wai in which she treat us
then telemachu said eurymachu and you other suitor i shall sai
no more and entreat you no further for the god and the peopl of
ithaca now know my stori give me then a ship and a crew of twenti
men to take me hither and thither and i will go to sparta and to pylo
in quest of my father who ha so long been miss some on mai tell
me someth or and peopl often hear thing in thi wai some
heavens messag mai direct me if i can hear of him as aliv and on
hi wai home i will put up with the wast you suitor will make for yet
anoth twelv month if on the other hand i hear of hi death i will
return at onc celebr hi funer rite with all due pomp build a
barrow to hi memori and make my mother marri again
with these word he sat down and mentor20 who had been a friend of
ulyss and had been left in charg of everyth with full author
over the servant rose to speak he then plainli and in all honesti
address them thu
hear me men of ithaca i hope that you mai never have a kind and
welldispos ruler ani more nor on who will govern you equit i
hope that all your chief henceforward mai be cruel and unjust for
there is not on of you but ha forgotten ulyss who rule you as
though he were your father i am not half so angri with the suitor
for if thei choos to do violenc in the naughti of their heart
and wager their head that ulyss will not return thei can take the
high hand and eat up hi estat but as for you other i am shock at
the wai in which you all sit still without even try to stop such
scandal go onwhich you could do if you chose for you ar mani
and thei ar few
leiocritu son of evenor answer him sai mentor what folli is
all thi that you should set the peopl to stai us it is a hard thing
for on man to fight with mani about hi victual even though ulyss
himself were to set upon us while we ar feast in hi hous and do
hi best to oust us hi wife who want him back so veri badli would
have small caus for rejoic and hi blood would be upon hi own
head if he fought against such great odd there is no sens in what
you have been sai now therefor do you peopl go about your
busi and let hi father old friend mentor and halithers
speed thi boi on hi journei if he goe at allwhich i do not think
he will for he is more like to stai where he is till some on come
and tell him someth
on thi he broke up the assembl and everi man went back to hi own
abod while the suitor return to the hous of ulyss
then telemachu went all alon by the sea side wash hi hand in the
grei wave and prai to minerva
hear me he cri you god who visit me yesterdai and bade me
sail the sea in search of my father who ha so long been miss i
would obei you but the achaean and more particularli the wick
suitor ar hinder me that i cannot do so
as he thu prai minerva came close up to him in the like and
with the voic of mentor telemachu said she if you ar made of
the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward
henceforward for ulyss never broke hi word nor left hi work half
done if then you take after him your voyag will not be fruitless
but unless you have the blood of ulyss and of penelop in your vein
i see no likelihood of your succeed son ar seldom as good men as
their father thei ar gener wors not better still as you ar
not go to be either fool or coward henceforward and ar not
entir without some share of your father wise discern i look
with hope upon your undertak but mind you never make common caus
with ani of those foolish suitor for thei have neither sens nor
virtu and give no thought to death and to the doom that will shortli
fall on on and all of them so that thei shall perish on the same dai
as for your voyag it shall not be long delai your father wa such
an old friend of mine that i will find you a ship and will come with
you myself now howev return home and go about among the suitor
begin get provis readi for your voyag see everyth well
stow the wine in jar and the barlei meal which is the staff of
life in leathern bag while i go round the town and beat up
volunt at onc there ar mani ship in ithaca both old and new i
will run my ey over them for you and will choos the best we will get
her readi and will put out to sea without delai
thu spoke minerva daughter of jove and telemachu lost no time in
do as the goddess told him he went moodili home and found the
suitor flai goat and sing pig in the outer court antin
came up to him at onc and laugh as he took hi hand in hi own
sai telemachu my fine fireeat bear no more ill blood neither
in word nor deed but eat and drink with us as you us to do the
achaean will find you in everythinga ship and a pick crew to
bootso that you can set sail for pylo at onc and get new of your
nobl father
antin answer telemachu i cannot eat in peac nor take
pleasur of ani kind with such men as you ar wa it not enough that
you should wast so much good properti of mine while i wa yet a boi
now that i am older and know more about it i am also stronger and
whether here among thi peopl or by go to pylo i will do you all
the harm i can i shall go and my go will not be in vainthough
thank to you suitor i have neither ship nor crew of my own and must
be passeng not captain
as he spoke he snatch hi hand from that of antin meanwhil the
other went on get dinner readi about the buildings21 jeer at
him tauntingli as thei did so
telemachu said on youngster mean to be the death of us i
suppos he think he can bring friend to help him from pylo or again
from sparta where he seem bent on go or will he go to ephyra as
well for poison to put in our wine and kill us
anoth said perhap if telemachu goe on board ship he will be
like hi father and perish far from hi friend in thi case we should
have plenti to do for we could then divid up hi properti amongst us
as for the hous we can let hi mother and the man who marri her have
that
thi wa how thei talk but telemachu went down into the lofti and
spaciou storeroom where hi father treasur of gold and bronz lai
heap up upon the floor and where the linen and spare cloth were
kept in open chest here too there wa a store of fragrant oliv
oil while cask of old wellripen wine unblend and fit for a god

the old woman swore most solemnli that she would not and when she had
complet her oath she began draw off the wine into jar and
get the barlei meal into the bag while telemachu went back to
the suitor
then minerva bethought her of anoth matter she took hi shape and
went round the town to each on of the crew tell them to meet at
the ship by sundown she went also to noemon son of phroniu and ask
him to let her have a shipwhich he wa veri readi to do when the sun

furthermor she went to the hous of ulyss and threw the suitor
into a deep slumber she caus their drink to fuddl them and made
them drop their cup from their hand so that instead of sit over

some thing telemachu answer minerva will be suggest to you
by your own instinct and heaven will prompt you further for i am
assur that the god have been with you from the time of your birth
until now
she then went quickli on and telemachu follow in her step till

telemachu answer boldli for minerva had given him courag to ask
about hi father and get himself a good name
nestor said he son of neleu honour to the achaean name you ask
whenc we come and i will tell you we come from ithaca under
neritum28 and the matter about which i would speak is of privat not
public import i seek new of my unhappi father ulyss who is said to
have sack the town of troi in compani with yourself we know what
fate befel each on of the other hero who fought at troi but as
regard ulyss heaven ha hidden from us the knowledg even that he is
dead at all for no on can certifi us in what place he perish nor
sai whether he fell in battl on the mainland or wa lost at sea amid
the wave of amphitrit therefor i am suppliant at your knee if
hapli you mai be pleas to tell me of hi melancholi end whether you
saw it with your own ey or heard it from some other travel for
he wa a man born to troubl do not soften thing out of ani piti for
me but tell me in all plain exactli what you saw if my brave
father ulyss ever did you loyal servic either by word or deed when
you achaean were harass among the trojan bear it in mind now as in

king priam our best men all of them fell thereajax achil
patroclu peer of god in counsel and my own dear son antilochu a
man singularli fleet of foot and in fight valiant but we suffer much
more than thi what mortal tongu inde could tell the whole stori
though you were to stai here and question me for five year or even
six i could not tell you all that the achaean suffer and you would
turn homeward weari of my tale befor it end nine long year did we
try everi kind of stratagem but the hand of heaven wa against us
dure all thi time there wa no on who could compar with your
father in subtletyif inde you ar hi soni can hardli believ my
eyesand you talk just like him toono on would sai that peopl of
such differ ag could speak so much alik he and i never had ani
kind of differ from first to last neither in camp nor council but
in singl of heart and purpos we advis the argiv how all might
be order for the best
when howev we had sack the citi of priam and were set sail
in our ship as heaven had dispers us then jove saw fit to vex the
argiv on their homeward voyag for thei had not all been either wise
or understand and henc mani came to a bad end through the
displeasur of jove daughter minerva who brought about a quarrel
between the two son of atreu

mind about our coursefor we did not know whether to go outsid chio
by the island of psyra keep thi to our left or insid chio over
against the stormi headland of mima so we ask heaven for a sign
and were shown on to the effect that we should be soonest out of
danger if we head our ship across the open sea to euboea thi we
therefor did and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passag
dure the night to geraestus29 where we offer mani sacrific to

agamemnon
i will tell you truli answer nestor and inde you have yourself
divin how it all happen if menelau when he got back from troi had
found aegisthu still aliv in hi hous there would have been no
barrow heap up for him not even when he wa dead but he would have

would have mourn him for he had done a deed of great wicked but
we were over there fight hard at troi and aegisthu who wa
take hi eas quietli in the heart of argo cajol agamemnon wife
clytemnestra with incess flatteri

pit on after the other and threw a seal skin over each of us our
ambuscad would have been intoler for the stench of the fishi
seal wa most distressing45who would go to bed with a sea monster if
he could help itbut here too the goddess help us and thought of
someth that gave us great relief for she put some ambrosia under

meanwhil the suitor were clamor throughout the cover cloister
and on of them said

lest some of it get carri insid let us be up and do that in
silenc about which we ar all of a mind
he then chose twenti men and thei went down to their ship and to the
sea side thei drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and
sail insid her thei bound the oar to the tholepin with twist
thong of leather all in due cours and spread the white sail aloft
while their fine servant brought them their armour then thei made the

wait till night should fall
but penelop lai in her own room upstair unabl to eat or drink and
wonder whether her brave son would escap or be overpow by the
wick suitor like a lioness caught in the toil with huntsmen
hem her in on everi side she thought and thought till she sank into
a slumber and lai on her bed bereft of thought and motion
then minerva bethought her of anoth matter and made a vision in the
like of penelop sister iphthim daughter of icariu who had
marri eumelu and live in phera she told the vision to go to the
hous of ulyss and to make penelop leav off cry so it came
into her room by the hole through which the thong went for pull the
door to and hover over her head sai
you ar asleep penelop the god who live at eas will not suffer
you to weep and be so sad your son ha done them no wrong so he will
yet come back to you
penelop who wa sleep sweetli at the gate of dreamland answer
sister why have you come here you do not come veri often but i
suppos that is becaus you live such a long wai off am i then to
leav off cry and refrain from all the sad thought that tortur me
i who have lost my brave and lionheart husband who had everi good
qualiti under heaven and whose name wa great over all hella and
middl argo and now my darl son ha gone off on board of a shipa
foolish fellow who ha never been us to rough it nor to go
about among gather of men i am even more anxiou about him than
about my husband i am all in a trembl when i think of him lest
someth should happen to him either from the peopl among whom he
ha gone or by sea for he ha mani enemi who ar plot against
him and ar bent on kill him befor he can return home
then the vision said take heart and be not so much dismai there
is on gone with him whom mani a man would be glad enough to have stand
by hi side i mean minerva it is she who ha compass upon you and
who ha sent me to bear you thi messag
then said penelop if you ar a god or have been sent here by
divin commiss tell me also about that other unhappi onei he
still aliv or is he alreadi dead and in the hous of hade
and the vision said i shall not tell you for certain whether he is
aliv or dead and there is no us in idl convers
then it vanish through the thonghol of the door and wa dissip
into thin air but penelop rose from her sleep refresh and
comfort so vivid had been her dream
meantim the suitor went on board and sail their wai over the sea
intent on murder telemachu now there is a rocki islet call
asteri of no great size in mid channel between ithaca and samo and
there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie here then

with which he seal men ey in sleep or wake them just as he
pleas and flew hold it in hi hand over pieria then he swoop

corner of the ocean and drench it thick plumag in the sprai he
flew and flew over mani a weari wave but when at last he got to the
island which wa hi journei end he left the sea and went on by land
till he came to the cave where the nymph calypso live

even a god could not help be charm with such a love spot so
mercuri stood still and look at it but when he had admir it

i got fond of him and cherish him and had set my heart on make him
immort so that he should never grow old all hi dai still i cannot
cross jove nor bring hi counsel to noth therefor if he insist
upon it let the man go beyond the sea again but i cannot send him

on thi he took hi leav and calypso went out to look for ulyss
for she had heard jove messag she found him sit upon the beach
with hi ey ever fill with tear and dy of sheer home sick
for he had got tire of calypso and though he wa forc to sleep with
her in the cave by night it wa she not he that would have it so as
for the dai time he spent it on the rock and on the sea shore
weep cry aloud for hi despair and alwai look out upon the
sea calypso then went close up to him said

so go cut some beam of wood and make yourself a larg raft with an
upper deck that it mai carri you safe over the sea i will put bread
wine and water on board to save you from starv i will also give
you cloth and will send you a fair wind to take you home if the

ulyss shudder as he heard her now goddess he answer there
is someth behind all thi you cannot be realli mean to help me
home when you bid me do such a dread thing as put to sea on a raft
not even a well found ship with a fair wind could ventur on such a

mischief
calypso smile at thi and caress him with her hand you know a

when she had thu spoken she led the wai rapidli befor him and
ulyss follow in her step so the pair goddess and man went on
and on till thei came to calypso cave where ulyss took the seat
that mercuri had just left calypso set meat and drink befor him of
the food that mortal eat but her maid brought ambrosia and nectar
for herself and thei laid their hand on the good thing that were
befor them when thei had satisfi themselv with meat and drink
calypso spoke sai

land at onc good luck go with you but if you could onli know how
much suffer is in store for you befor you get back to your own
countri you would stai where you ar keep hous along with me and
let me make you immort no matter how anxiou you mai be to see thi
wife of your of whom you ar think all the time dai after dai yet
i flatter myself that i am no whit less tall or welllook than she
is for it is not to be expect that a mortal woman should compar in
beauti with an immort
goddess repli ulyss do not be angri with me about thi i am
quit awar that my wife penelop is noth like so tall or so
beauti as yourself she is onli a woman wherea you ar an
immort nevertheless i want to get home and can think of noth
els if some god wreck me when i am on the sea i will bear it and
make the best of it i have had infinit troubl both by land and sea
alreadi so let thi go with the rest
present the sun set and it becam dark whereon the pair retir into
the inner part of the cave and went to bed
when the child of morn rosyfing dawn appear ulyss put on
hi shirt and cloak while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossam
fabric veri fine and grace with a beauti golden girdl about
her waist and a veil to cover her head she at onc set herself to
think how she could speed ulyss on hi wai so she gave him a great
bronz ax that suit hi hand it wa sharpen on both side and
had a beauti olivewood handl fit firmli on to it she also gave
him a sharp adz and then led the wai to the far end of the island
where the largest tree grewald poplar and pine that reach the
skyveri dry and well season so as to sail light for him in the
water53 then when she had shown him where the best tree grew
calypso went home leav him to cut them which he soon finish
do he cut down twenti tree in all and adz them smooth squar
them by rule in good workmanlik fashion meanwhil calypso came back
with some auger so he bore hole with them and fit the timber
togeth with bolt and rivet he made the raft as broad as a skill
shipwright make the beam of a larg vessel and he fix a deck on top
of the rib and ran a gunwal all round it he also made a mast with a
yard arm and a rudder to steer with he fenc the raft all round with
wicker hurdl as a protect against the wave and then he threw on
a quantiti of wood by and by calypso brought him some linen to make
the sail and he made these too excel make them fast with
brace and sheet last of all with the help of lever he drew the
raft down into the water
in four dai he had complet the whole work and on the fifth calypso
sent him from the island after wash him and give him some clean
cloth she gave him a goat skin full of black wine and anoth
larger on of water she also gave him a wallet full of provis and
found him in much good meat moreov she made the wind fair and warm
for him and gladli did ulyss spread hi sail befor it while he sat
and guid the raft skilfulli by mean of the rudder he never close
hi ey but kept them fix on the pleiad on lateset boot
and on the bearwhich men also call the wain and which turn round and
round where it is face orion and alon never dip into the
stream of oceanusfor calypso had told him to keep thi to hi left
dai seven and ten did he sail over the sea and on the eighteenth the
dim outlin of the mountain on the nearest part of the phaeacian
coast appear rise like a shield on the horizon
but king neptun who wa return from the ethiopian caught sight
of ulyss a long wai off from the mountain of the solymi he could
see him sail upon the sea and it made him veri angri so he wag
hi head and mutter to himself sai good heaven so the god
have been chang their mind about ulyss while i wa awai in
ethiopia and now he is close to the land of the phaeacian where it
is decre that he shall escap from the calam that have befallen
him still he shall have plenti of hardship yet befor he ha done
with it
thereon he gather hi cloud togeth grasp hi trident stir
it round in the sea and rous the rage of everi wind that blow till
earth sea and sky were hidden in cloud and night sprang forth out of
the heaven wind from east south north and west fell upon him all
at the same time and a tremend sea got up so that ulyss heart
began to fail him ala he said to himself in hi dismai what ever
will becom of me i am afraid calypso wa right when she said i should
have troubl by sea befor i got back home it is all come true how
black is jove make heaven with hi cloud and what a sea the wind
ar rais from everi quarter at onc i am now safe to perish blest
and thrice blest were those danaan who fell befor troi in the caus
of the son of atreu would that i had been kill on the dai when the
trojan were press me so sore about the dead bodi of achil for
then i should have had due burial and the achaean would have honour
my name but now it seem that i shall come to a most pitiabl end
as he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrif furi that the raft
reel again and he wa carri overboard a long wai off he let go
the helm and the forc of the hurrican wa so great that it broke the
mast half wai up and both sail and yard went over into the sea for a
long time ulyss wa under water and it wa all he could do to rise
to the surfac again for the cloth calypso had given him weigh him
down but at last he got hi head abov water and spat out the bitter
brine that wa run down hi face in stream in spite of all thi
howev he did not lose sight of hi raft but swam as fast as he
could toward it got hold of it and climb on board again so as to
escap drown the sea took the raft and toss it about as autumn
wind whirl thistledown round and round upon a road it wa as though
the south north east and west wind were all plai battledor and
shuttlecock with it at onc
when he wa in thi plight ino daughter of cadmu also call
leucothea saw him she had formerli been a mere mortal but had been
sinc rais to the rank of a marin goddess see in what great
distress ulyss now wa she had compass upon him and rise like
a seagul from the wave took her seat upon the raft
my poor good man said she why is neptun so furious angri with
you he is give you a great deal of troubl but for all hi bluster
he will not kill you you seem to be a sensibl person do then as i
bid you strip leav your raft to drive befor the wind and swim to
the phaeacian coast where better luck await you and here take my
veil and put it round your chest it is enchant and you can come to
no harm so long as you wear it as soon as you touch land take it off
throw it back as far as you can into the sea and then go awai again
with these word she took off her veil and gave it him then she dive
down again like a seagul and vanish beneath the dark blue water
but ulyss did not know what to think ala he said to himself in
hi dismai thi is onli some on or other of the god who is lure
me to ruin by advis me to quit my raft at ani rate i will not do so
at present for the land where she said i should be quit of all
troubl seem to be still a good wai off i know what i will doi am
sure it will be bestno matter what happen i will stick to the raft as
long as her timber hold togeth but when the sea break her up i
will swim for it i do not see how i can do ani better than thi
while he wa thu in two mind neptun sent a terribl great wave that
seem to rear itself abov hi head till it broke right over the raft
which then went to piec as though it were a heap of dry chaff toss
about by a whirlwind ulyss got astrid of on plank and rode upon it
as if he were on horseback he then took off the cloth calypso had
given him bound ino veil under hi arm and plung into the
seamean to swim on shore king neptun watch him as he did so
and wag hi head mutter to himself and sai there now swim
up and down as you best can till you fall in with welltodo peopl i
do not think you will be abl to sai that i have let you off too
lightli on thi he lash hi hors and drove to aega where hi
palac is
but minerva resolv to help ulyss so she bound the wai of all the
wind except on and made them lie quit still but she rous a good
stiff breez from the north that should lai the water till ulyss
reach the land of the phaeacian where he would be safe
thereon he float about for two night and two dai in the water with
a heavi swell on the sea and death stare him in the face but when
the third dai broke the wind fell and there wa a dead calm without so
much as a breath of air stir as he rose on the swell he look
eagerli ahead and could see land quit near then as children rejoic
when their dear father begin to get better after have for a long
time born sore afflict sent him by some angri spirit but the god
deliv him from evil so wa ulyss thank when he again saw land
and tree and swam on with all hi strength that he might onc more
set foot upon dry ground when howev he got within earshot he
began to hear the surf thunder up against the rock for the swell
still broke against them with a terrif roar everyth wa envelop
in sprai there were no harbour where a ship might ride nor shelter
of ani kind but onli headland lowli rock and mountain top
ulyss heart now began to fail him and he said despairingli to
himself ala jove ha let me see land after swim so far that i
had given up all hope but i can find no land place for the coast
is rocki and surfbeaten the rock ar smooth and rise sheer from the
sea with deep water close under them so that i cannot climb out for
want of foot hold i am afraid some great wave will lift me off my leg
and dash me against the rock as i leav the waterwhich would give me
a sorri land if on the other hand i swim further in search of
some shelv beach or harbour a hurrican mai carri me out to sea
again sore against my will or heaven mai send some great monster of
the deep to attack me for amphitrit breed mani such and i know that
neptun is veri angri with me
while he wa thu in two mind a wave caught him and took him with such
forc against the rock that he would have been smash and torn to
piec if minerva had not shown him what to do he caught hold of the
rock with both hand and clung to it groan with pain till the wave
retir so he wa save that time but present the wave came on
again and carri him back with it far into the seatear hi hand
as the sucker of a polypu ar torn when some on pluck it from it
bed and the stone come up along with iteven so did the rock tear
the skin from hi strong hand and then the wave drew him deep down
under the water
here poor ulyss would have certainli perish even in spite of hi
own destini if minerva had not help him to keep hi wit about him
he swam seaward again beyond reach of the surf that wa beat
against the land and at the same time he kept look toward the
shore to see if he could find some haven or a spit that should take
the wave aslant by and by as he swam on he came to the mouth of a
river and here he thought would be the best place for there were no
rock and it afford shelter from the wind he felt that there wa a
current so he prai inwardli and said
hear me o king whoever you mai be and save me from the anger of the
seagod neptun for i approach you prayerfulli ani on who ha lost
hi wai ha at all time a claim even upon the god wherefor in my
distress i draw near to your stream and cling to the knee of your
riverhood have merci upon me o king for i declar myself your
suppliant
then the god staid hi stream and still the wave make all calm
befor him and bring him safe into the mouth of the river here
at last ulyss knee and strong hand fail him for the sea had
complet broken him hi bodi wa all swollen and hi mouth and
nostril ran down like a river with seawat so that he could neither
breath nor speak and lai swoon from sheer exhaust present
when he had got hi breath and came to himself again he took off the
scarf that ino had given him and threw it back into the salt54 stream
of the river whereon ino receiv it into her hand from the wave that
bore it toward her then he left the river laid himself down among
the rush and kiss the bounteou earth
ala he cri to himself in hi dismai what ever will becom of
me and how is it all to end if i stai here upon the river bed through
the long watch of the night i am so exhaust that the bitter cold
and damp mai make an end of mefor toward sunris there will be a keen
wind blow from off the river if on the other hand i climb the
hill side find shelter in the wood and sleep in some thicket i mai
escap the cold and have a good night rest but some savag beast mai
take advantag of me and devour me
in the end he deem it best to take to the wood and he found on
upon some high ground not far from the water there he crept beneath
two shoot of oliv that grew from a singl stockth on an ungraft
sucker while the other had been graft no wind howev squalli
could break through the cover thei afford nor could the sun rai
pierc them nor the rain get through them so close did thei grow
into on anoth ulyss crept under these and began to make himself a
bed to lie on for there wa a great litter of dead leav ly
aboutenough to make a cover for two or three men even in hard
winter weather he wa glad enough to see thi so he laid himself down
and heap the leav all round him then as on who live alon in
the countri far from ani neighbor hide a brand as firese in the
ash to save himself from have to get a light elsewher even so did
ulyss cover himself up with leav and minerva shed a sweet sleep
upon hi ey close hi eyelid and made him lose all memori of
hi sorrow
book vi

so here ulyss slept overcom by sleep and toil but minerva went off
to the countri and citi of the phaeaciansa peopl who us to live in

father and mother all about it and found them in their own room her
mother wa sit by the firesid spin her purpl yarn with her

cloth down from the linen room and place them on the waggon her
mother prepar her a basket of provis with all sort of good
thing and a goat skin full of wine the girl now got into the waggon
and her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil that she and her
women might anoint themselv then she took the whip and rein and
lash the mule on whereon thei set off and their hoof clatter on
the road thei pull without flag and carri not onli nausicaa
and her wash of cloth but the maid also who were with her
when thei reach the water side thei went to the wash cistern
through which there ran at all time enough pure water to wash ani

laid them out by the sea side where the wave had rais a high beach
of shingl and set about wash themselv and anoint themselv
with oliv oil then thei got their dinner by the side of the stream
and wait for the sun to finish dry the cloth when thei had done
dinner thei threw off the veil that cover their head and began to
plai at ball while nausicaa sang for them as the huntress diana goe
forth upon the mountain of taygetu or erymanthu to hunt wild boar
or deer and the wood nymph daughter of aegisbear jove take
their sport along with her then is leto proud at see her daughter
stand a full head taller than the other and eclips the loveliest
amid a whole bevi of beauti even so did the girl outshin her
handmaid
when it wa time for them to start home and thei were fold the
cloth and put them into the waggon minerva began to consid how
ulyss should wake up and see the handsom girl who wa to conduct him
to the citi of the phaeacian the girl therefor threw a ball at on
of the maid which miss her and fell into deep water on thi thei
all shout and the nois thei made woke ulyss who sat up in hi
bed of leav and began to wonder what it might all be
ala said he to himself what kind of peopl have i come amongst
ar thei cruel savag and uncivilis or hospit and human i
seem to hear the voic of young women and thei sound like those of
the nymph that haunt mountain top or spring of river and meadow
of green grass at ani rate i am among a race of men and women let me
try if i cannot manag to get a look at them
as he said thi he crept from under hi bush and broke off a bough
cover with thick leav to hide hi naked he look like some
lion of the wilder that stalk about exult in hi strength and
defi both wind and rain hi ey glare as he prowl in quest of
oxen sheep or deer for he is famish and will dare break even into
a well fenc homestead try to get at the sheepeven such did
ulyss seem to the young women as he drew near to them all nake as
he wa for he wa in great want on see on so unkempt and so
begrim with salt water the other scamper off along the spit that
jut out into the sea but the daughter of alcin stood firm for
minerva put courag into her heart and took awai all fear from her she
stood right in front of ulyss and he doubt whether he should go up
to her throw himself at her feet and embrac her knee as a
suppliant or stai where he wa and entreat her to give him some
cloth and show him the wai to the town in the end he deem it best
to entreat her from a distanc in case the girl should take offenc at
hi come near enough to clasp her knee so he address her in
honei and persuas languag
o queen he said i implor your aidbut tell me ar you a goddess
or ar you a mortal woman if you ar a goddess and dwell in heaven i
can onli conjectur that you ar jove daughter diana for your face
and figur resembl none but her if on the other hand you ar a
mortal and live on earth thrice happi ar your father and
motherthric happi too ar your brother and sister how proud and
delight thei must feel when thei see so fair a scion as yourself
go out to a danc most happi howev of all will he be whose
wed gift have been the richest and who take you to hi own home
i never yet saw ani on so beauti neither man nor woman and am
lost in admir as i behold you i can onli compar you to a young
palm tree which i saw when i wa at delo grow near the altar of
apollofor i wa there too with much peopl after me when i wa on
that journei which ha been the sourc of all my troubl never yet
did such a young plant shoot out of the ground as that wa and i
admir and wonder at it exactli as i now admir and wonder at
yourself i dare not clasp your knee but i am in great distress
yesterdai made the twentieth dai that i had been toss about upon the
sea the wind and wave have taken me all the wai from the ogygian
island55 and now fate ha flung me upon thi coast that i mai endur
still further suffer for i do not think that i have yet come to the
end of it but rather that heaven ha still much evil in store for me
and now o queen have piti upon me for you ar the first person i
have met and i know no on els in thi countri show me the wai to
your town and let me have anyth that you mai have brought hither to
wrap your cloth in mai heaven grant you in all thing your heart

better in thi world than that man and wife should be of on mind in a
hous it discomfit their enemi make the heart of their friend
glad and thei themselv know more about it than ani on
to thi nausicaa answer stranger you appear to be a sensibl
welldispos person there is no account for luck jove give
prosper to rich and poor just as he choos so you must take what
he ha seen fit to send you and make the best of it now howev
that you have come to thi our countri you shall not want for cloth
nor for anyth els that a foreign in distress mai reason look
for i will show you the wai to the town and will tell you the name of
our peopl we ar call phaeacian and i am daughter to alcin in
whom the whole power of the state is vest
then she call her maid and said stai where you ar you girl can
you not see a man without run awai from him do you take him for a
robber or a murder neither he nor ani on els can come here to do
us phaeacian ani harm for we ar dear to the god and live apart on
a land end that jut into the sound sea and have noth to do
with ani other peopl thi is onli some poor man who ha lost hi wai
and we must be kind to him for stranger and foreign in distress
ar under jove protect and will take what thei can get and be
thank so girl give the poor fellow someth to eat and drink
and wash him in the stream at some place that is shelter from the
wind
on thi the maid left off run awai and began call on anoth
back thei made ulyss sit down in the shelter as nausicaa had told
them and brought him a shirt and cloak thei also brought him the
littl golden cruse of oil and told him to go and wash in the stream
but ulyss said young women pleas to stand a littl on on side
that i mai wash the brine from my shoulder and anoint myself with oil
for it is long enough sinc my skin ha had a drop of oil upon it i
cannot wash as long as you all keep stand there i am asham to
strip56 befor a number of good look young women
then thei stood on on side and went to tell the girl while ulyss
wash himself in the stream and scrub the brine from hi back and
from hi broad shoulder when he had thoroughli wash himself and
had got the brine out of hi hair he anoint himself with oil and
put on the cloth which the girl had given him minerva then made him
look taller and stronger than befor she also made the hair grow thick
on the top of hi head and flow down in curl like hyacinth blossom
she glorifi him about the head and shoulder as a skil workman who
ha studi art of all kind under vulcan and minerva enrich a piec
of silver plate by gild itand hi work is full of beauti then he
went and sat down a littl wai off upon the beach look quit young
and handsom and the girl gaze on him with admir then she said
to her maid
hush my dear for i want to sai someth i believ the god who
live in heaven have sent thi man to the phaeacian when i first saw
him i thought him plain but now hi appear is like that of the
god who dwell in heaven i should like my futur husband to be just
such anoth as he is if he would onli stai here and not want to go
awai howev give him someth to eat and drink
thei did as thei were told and set food befor ulyss who at and
drank raven for it wa long sinc he had had food of ani kind
meanwhil nausicaa bethought her of anoth matter she got the linen
fold and place in the waggon she then yoke the mule and as she
took her seat she call ulyss
stranger said she rise and let us be go back to the town i
will introduc you at the hous of my excel father where i can
tell you that you will meet all the best peopl among the phaeacian
but be sure and do as i bid you for you seem to be a sensibl person
as long as we ar go past the field and farm land follow briskli
behind the waggon along with the maid and i will lead the wai myself
present howev we shall come to the town where you will find a
high wall run all round it and a good harbour on either side with
a narrow entranc into the citi and the ship will be drawn up by the
road side for everi on ha a place where hi own ship can lie you
will see the market place with a templ of neptun in the middl of it
and pave with larg stone bed in the earth here peopl deal in
ship gear of all kind such as cabl and sail and here too ar
the place where oar ar made for the phaeacian ar not a nation of
archer thei know noth about bow and arrow but ar a seafar
folk and pride themselv on their mast oar and ship with which
thei travel far over the sea
i am afraid of the gossip and scandal that mai be set on foot against
me later on for the peopl here ar veri illnatur and some low
fellow if he met us might sai who is thi finelook stranger
that is go about with nausicaa where did she find him i suppos
she is go to marri him perhap he is a vagabond sailor whom she ha
taken from some foreign vessel for we have no neighbour or some god
ha at last come down from heaven in answer to her prayer and she is
go to live with him all the rest of her life it would be a good
thing if she would take herself off and find a husband somewher els
for she will not look at on of the mani excel young phaeacian who

thu then did ulyss wait and prai but the girl drove on to the
town when she reach her father hous she drew up at the gatewai
and her brotherscom as the godsgath round her took the mule
out of the waggon and carri the cloth into the hous while she
went to her own room where an old servant eurymedusa of apeira lit
the fire for her thi old woman had been brought by sea from apeira
and had been chosen as a prize for alcin becaus he wa king over
the phaeacian and the peopl obei him as though he were a god57
she had been nurs to nausicaa and had now lit the fire for her and
brought her supper for her into her own room
present ulyss got up to go toward the town and minerva shed a
thick mist all round him to hide him in case ani of the proud
phaeacian who met him should be rude to him or ask him who he wa
then as he wa just enter the town she came toward him in the
like of a littl girl carri a pitcher she stood right in front
of him and ulyss said
my dear will you be so kind as to show me the hous of king alcin
i am an unfortun foreign in distress and do not know on in your
town and countri
then minerva said ye father stranger i will show you the hous you
want for alcin live quit close to my own father i will go befor
you and show the wai but sai not a word as you go and do not look at
ani man nor ask him question for the peopl here cannot abid
stranger and do not like men who come from some other place thei ar
a seafar folk and sail the sea by the grace of neptun in ship
that glide along like thought or as a bird in the air
on thi she led the wai and ulyss follow in her step but not on
of the phaeacian could see him as he pass through the citi in the
midst of them for the great goddess minerva in her good will toward
him had hidden him in a thick cloud of dark he admir their
harbour ship place of assembl and the lofti wall of the citi
which with the palisad on top of them were veri strike and when
thei reach the king hous minerva said
thi is the hous father stranger which you would have me show you
you will find a number of great peopl sit at tabl but do not be
afraid go straight in for the bolder a man is the more like he is
to carri hi point even though he is a stranger first find the queen
her name is aret and she come of the same famili as her husband
alcin thei both descend origin from neptun who wa father to
nausith by periboea a woman of great beauti periboea wa the
youngest daughter of eurymedon who at on time reign over the
giant but he ruin hi illfat peopl and lost hi own life to
boot
neptun howev lai with hi daughter and she had a son by him the
great nausith who reign over the phaeacian nausith had two
son rhexenor and alcinous58 apollo kill the first of them while he
wa still a bridegroom and without male issu but he left a daughter
aret whom alcin marri and honour as no other woman is honour
of all those that keep hous along with their husband
thu she both wa and still is respect beyond measur by her
children by alcin himself and by the whole peopl who look upon
her as a goddess and greet her whenev she goe about the citi for
she is a thoroughli good woman both in head and heart and when ani
women ar friend of her she will help their husband also to settl
their disput if you can gain her good will you mai have everi hope
of see your friend again and get safe back to your home and
countri
then minerva left scheria and went awai over the sea she went to
marathon59 and to the spaciou street of athen where she enter the
abod of erechtheu but ulyss went on to the hous of alcin and
he ponder much as he paus a while befor reach the threshold of
bronz for the splendour of the palac wa like that of the sun or
moon the wall on either side were of bronz from end to end and the
cornic wa of blue enamel the door were gold and hung on pillar of
silver that rose from a floor of bronz while the lintel wa silver
and the hook of the door wa of gold
on either side there stood gold and silver mastiff which vulcan with
hi consumm skill had fashion expressli to keep watch over the
palac of king alcin so thei were immort and could never grow
old seat were rang all along the wall here and there from on end
to the other with cover of fine woven work which the women of the
hous had made here the chief person of the phaeacian us to sit
and eat and drink for there wa abund at all season and there
were golden figur of young men with light torch in their hand
rais on pedest to give light by night to those who were at tabl
there are60 fifti maid servant in the hous some of whom ar alwai
grind rich yellow grain at the mill while other work at the loom
or sit and spin and their shuttl go backward and forward like the
flutter of aspen leav while the linen is so close woven that it
will turn oil as the phaeacian ar the best sailor in the world so
their women excel all other in weav for minerva ha taught them
all manner of us art and thei ar veri intellig
outsid the gate of the outer court there is a larg garden of about
four acr with a wall all round it it is full of beauti
treespear pomegran and the most delici appl there ar
lusciou fig also and oliv in full growth the fruit never rot nor
fail all the year round neither winter nor summer for the air is so
soft that a new crop ripen befor the old ha drop pear grow on
pear appl on appl and fig on fig and so also with the grape for
there is an excel vineyard on the level ground of a part of thi
the grape ar be made into raisin in anoth part thei ar be
gather some ar be trodden in the wine tub other further on
have shed their blossom and ar begin to show fruit other again
ar just chang colour in the furthest part of the ground there ar
beautifulli arrang bed of flower that ar in bloom all the year
round two stream go through it the on turn in duct throughout
the whole garden while the other is carri under the ground of the
outer court to the hous itself and the town peopl draw water from
it such then were the splendour with which the god had endow the
hous of king alcin
so here ulyss stood for a while and look about him but when he had
look long enough he cross the threshold and went within the
precinct of the hous there he found all the chief peopl among the
phaeacian make their drink offer to mercuri which thei alwai
did the last thing befor go awai for the night61 he went straight
through the court still hidden by the cloak of dark in which
minerva had envelop him till he reach aret and king alcin
then he laid hi hand upon the knee of the queen and at that moment
the miracul dark fell awai from him and he becam visibl everi
on wa speechless with surpris at see a man there but ulyss
began at onc with hi petit
queen aret he exclaim daughter of great rhexenor in my
distress i humbl prai you as also your husband and these your guest
whom mai heaven prosper with long life and happi and mai thei
leav their possess to their children and all the honour
confer upon them by the state to help me home to my own countri as
soon as possibl for i have been long in troubl and awai from my
friend
then he sat down on the hearth among the ash and thei all held their
peac till present the old hero echeneu who wa an excel
speaker and an elder among the phaeacian plainli and in all honesti
address them thu
alcin said he it is not credit to you that a stranger
should be seen sit among the ash of your hearth everi on is
wait to hear what you ar about to sai tell him then to rise and
take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver and bid your servant mix
some wine and water that we mai make a drink offer to jove the lord
of thunder who take all well dispos suppliant under hi
protect and let the housekeep give him some supper of whatev
there mai be in the hous
when alcin heard thi he took ulyss by the hand rais him from
the hearth and bade him take the seat of laodama who had been
sit besid him and wa hi favourit son a maid servant then
brought him water in a beauti golden ewer and pour it into a
silver basin for him to wash hi hand and she drew a clean tabl
besid him an upper servant brought him bread and offer him mani
good thing of what there wa in the hous and ulyss at and drank
then alcin said to on of the servant ponton mix a cup of
wine and hand it round that we mai make drinkoff to jove the
lord of thunder who is the protector of all welldispos suppliant
ponton then mix wine and water and hand it round after give
everi man hi drinkoff when thei had made their offer and
had drunk each as much as he wa mind alcin said
aldermen and town councillor of the phaeacian hear my word you
have had your supper so now go home to bed tomorrow morn i shall
invit a still larger number of aldermen and will give a sacrifici
banquet in honour of our guest we can then discuss the question of hi
escort and consid how we mai at onc send him back rejoic to hi
own countri without troubl or inconveni to himself no matter how
distant it mai be we must see that he come to no harm while on hi
homeward journei but when he is onc at home he will have to take the
luck he wa born with for better or wors like other peopl it is
possibl howev that the stranger is on of the immort who ha
come down from heaven to visit us but in thi case the god ar
depart from their usual practic for hitherto thei have made
themselv perfectli clear to us when we have been offer them
hecatomb thei come and sit at our feast just like on of our selv
and if ani solitari wayfar happen to stumbl upon some on or other
of them thei affect no conceal for we ar as near of kin to the
god as the cyclop and the savag giant are62
then ulyss said prai alcin do not take ani such notion into
your head i have noth of the immort about me neither in bodi nor
mind and most resembl those among you who ar the most afflict
inde were i to tell you all that heaven ha seen fit to lai upon me
you would sai that i wa still wors off than thei ar nevertheless
let me sup in spite of sorrow for an empti stomach is a veri
importun thing and thrust itself on a man notic no matter how
dire is hi distress i am in great troubl yet it insist that i
shall eat and drink bid me lai asid all memori of my sorrow and
dwell onli on the due replenish of itself as for yourselv do as
you propos and at break of dai set about help me to get home i
shall be content to die if i mai first onc more behold my properti my
bondsmen and all the great of my house63
thu did he speak everi on approv hi sai and agre that he
should have hi escort inasmuch as he had spoken reason then when
thei had made their drink offer and had drunk each as much as he
wa mind thei went home to bed everi man in hi own abod leav
ulyss in the cloister with aret and alcin while the servant were
take the thing awai after supper aret wa the first to speak for
she recognis the shirt cloak and good cloth that ulyss wa
wear as the work of herself and of her maid so she said
stranger befor we go ani further there is a question i should like
to ask you who and whenc ar you and who gave you those cloth
did you not sai you had come here from beyond the sea
and ulyss answer it would be a long stori madam were i to relat
in full the tale of my misfortun for the hand of heaven ha been
laid heavi upon me but as regard your question there is an island
far awai in the sea which is call the ogygian here dwell the
cun and power goddess calypso daughter of atla she live by
herself far from all neighbour human or divin fortun howev
brought me to her hearth all desol and alon for jove struck my
ship with hi thunderbolt and broke it up in midocean my brave
comrad were drown everi man of them but i stuck to the keel and
wa carri hither and thither for the space of nine dai till at last
dure the dark of the tenth night the god brought me to the
ogygian island where the great goddess calypso live she took me in
and treat me with the utmost kind inde she want to make me
immort that i might never grow old but she could not persuad me to
let her do so
i stai with calypso seven year straight on end and water the
good cloth she gave me with my tear dure the whole time but at
last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free
will either becaus jove had told her she must or becaus she had
chang her mind she sent me from her island on a raft which she
provis with abund of bread and wine moreov she gave me good
stout cloth and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair dai
seven and ten did i sail over the sea and on the eighteenth i caught
sight of the first outlin of the mountain upon your coastand glad
inde wa i to set ey upon them nevertheless there wa still much
troubl in store for me for at thi point neptun would let me go no
further and rais a great storm against me the sea wa so terribl
high that i could no longer keep to my raft which went to piec under
the furi of the gale and i had to swim for it till wind and current
brought me to your shore
there i tri to land but could not for it wa a bad place and the
wave dash me against the rock so i again took to the sea and swam
on till i came to a river that seem the most like land place
for there were no rock and it wa shelter from the wind here then
i got out of the water and gather my sens togeth again night wa
come on so i left the river and went into a thicket where i
cover myself all over with leav and present heaven sent me off
into a veri deep sleep sick and sorri as i wa i slept among the
leav all night and through the next dai till afternoon when i woke
as the sun wa wester and saw your daughter maid servant plai
upon the beach and your daughter among them look like a goddess i
besought her aid and she prove to be of an excel disposit
much more so than could be expect from so young a personfor young
peopl ar apt to be thoughtless she gave me plenti of bread and wine
and when she had had me wash in the river she also gave me the
cloth in which you see me now therefor though it ha pain me to
do so i have told you the whole truth
then alcin said stranger it wa veri wrong of my daughter not to
bring you on at onc to my hous along with the maid see that she
wa the first person whose aid you ask
prai do not scold her repli ulyss she is not to blame she did
tell me to follow along with the maid but i wa asham and afraid
for i thought you might perhap be displeas if you saw me everi
human be is sometim a littl suspici and irrit
stranger repli alcin i am not the kind of man to get angri
about noth it is alwai better to be reason but by father
jove minerva and apollo now that i see what kind of person you ar
and how much you think as i do i wish you would stai here marri my
daughter and becom my soninlaw if you will stai i will give you a
hous and an estat but no on heaven forbid shall keep you here
against your own wish and that you mai be sure of thi i will attend
tomorrow to the matter of your escort you can sleep64 dure the whole
voyag if you like and the men shall sail you over smooth water
either to your own home or wherev you pleas even though it be a
long wai further off than euboea which those of my peopl who saw it
when thei took yellowhair rhadamanthu to see tityu the son of
gaia tell me is the furthest of ani placeand yet thei did the whole
voyag in a singl dai without distress themselv and came back
again afterward you will thu see how much my ship excel all other
and what magnific oarsmen my sailor ar
then wa ulyss glad and prai aloud sai father jove grant that
alcin mai do all as he ha said for so he will win an imperish
name among mankind and at the same time i shall return to my countri
thu did thei convers then aret told her maid to set a bed in the
room that wa in the gatehous and make it with good red rug and to
spread coverlet on the top of them with woollen cloak for ulyss to
wear the maid thereon went out with torch in their hand and when
thei had made the bed thei came up to ulyss and said rise sir
stranger and come with us for your bed is readi and glad inde wa
he to go to hi rest
so ulyss slept in a bed place in a room over the echo gatewai
but alcin lai in the inner part of the hous with the queen hi
wife by hi side
book viii

with these word she made them all want to come and thei flock to
the assembl till seat and stand room were alik crowd everi on
wa struck with the appear of ulyss for minerva had beautifi
him about the head and shoulder make him look taller and stouter
than he realli wa that he might impress the phaeacian favour as

the sea shore as thei had been told and when thei got there thei drew
the ship into the water got her mast and sail insid her bound the

a servant present led in the famou bard demodocu whom the muse had

she had endow him with a divin gift of song she had rob him of
hi eyesight ponton set a seat for him among the guest lean it
up against a bearingpost he hung the lyre for him on a peg over hi
head and show him where he wa to feel for it with hi hand he
also set a fair tabl with a basket of victual by hi side and a cup
of wine from which he might drink whenev he wa so dispos
the compani then laid their hand upon the good thing that were befor
them but as soon as thei had had enough to eat and drink the muse
inspir demodocu to sing the feat of hero and more especi a
matter that wa then in the mouth of all men to wit the quarrel
between ulyss and achil and the fierc word that thei heap on
on anoth as thei sat togeth at a banquet but agamemnon wa glad
when he heard hi chieftain quarrel with on anoth for apollo
had foretold him thi at pytho when he cross the stone floor to
consult the oracl here wa the begin of the evil that by the will
of jove fell both upon danaan and trojan
thu sang the bard but ulyss drew hi purpl mantl over hi head
and cover hi face for he wa asham to let the phaeacian see that
he wa weep when the bard left off sing he wipe the tear from
hi ey uncov hi face and take hi cup made a
drinkoff to the god but when the phaeacian press demodocu
to sing further for thei delight in hi lai then ulyss again
drew hi mantl over hi head and wept bitterli no on notic hi
distress except alcin who wa sit near him and heard the heavi
sigh that he wa heav so he at onc said aldermen and town
councillor of the phaeacian we have had enough now both of the

men of the phaeacian were go to see the sport a crowd of sever
thousand of peopl follow them and there were mani excel

laodama halio and clytoneu compet also
the foot race came first the cours wa set out for them from the
start post and thei rais a dust upon the plain as thei all flew
forward at the same moment clytoneu came in first by a long wai he
left everi on els behind him by the length of the furrow that a
coupl of mule can plough in a fallow field67 thei then turn to the
pain art of wrestl and here euryalu prove to be the best man
amphialu excel all the other in jump while at throw the
disc there wa no on who could approach elatreu alcinouss son
laodama wa the best boxer and he it wa who present said when
thei had all been divert with the game let us ask the stranger
whether he excel in ani of these sport he seem veri powerfulli
built hi thigh calv hand and neck ar of prodigi strength
nor is he at all old but he ha suffer much late and there is
noth like the sea for make havoc with a man no matter how strong
he is
you ar quit right laodama repli euryalu go up to your guest
and speak to him about it yourself
when laodama heard thi he made hi wai into the middl of the crowd
and said to ulyss i hope sir that you will enter yourself for
some on or other of our competit if you ar skill in ani of
themand you must have gone in for mani a on befor now there is
noth that doe ani on so much credit all hi life long as the
show himself a proper man with hi hand and feet have a try
therefor at someth and banish all sorrow from your mind your
return home will not be long delai for the ship is alreadi drawn
into the water and the crew is found
ulyss answer laodama why do you taunt me in thi wai my mind
is set rather on care than contest i have been through infinit
troubl and am come among you now as a suppliant prai your king
and peopl to further me on my return home
then euryalu revil him outright and said i gather then that you
ar unskil in ani of the mani sport that men gener delight in
i suppos you ar on of those grasp trader that go about in ship
as captain or merchant and who think of noth but of their outward
freight and homeward cargo there doe not seem to be much of the
athlet about you
for shame sir answer ulyss fierc you ar an insol
fellowso true is it that the god do not grace all men alik in
speech person and understand on man mai be of weak presenc but
heaven ha adorn thi with such a good convers that he charm
everi on who see him hi honei moder carri hi hearer with
him so that he is leader in all assembl of hi fellow and wherev
he goe he is look up to anoth mai be as handsom as a god but
hi good look ar not crown with discret thi is your case no
god could make a finer look fellow than you ar but you ar a fool
your illjudg remark have made me exceedingli angri and you ar
quit mistaken for i excel in a great mani athlet exercis inde
so long as i had youth and strength i wa among the first athlet of
the ag now howev i am worn out by labour and sorrow for i have
gone through much both on the field of battl and by the wave of the
weari sea still in spite of all thi i will compet for your taunt
have stung me to the quick
so he hurri up without even take hi cloak off and seiz a disc
larger more massiv and much heavier than those us by the phaeacian
when discthrow among themselves68 then swing it back he threw
it from hi brawni hand and it made a hum sound in the air as he
did so the phaeacian quail beneath the rush of it flight as it
sped gracefulli from hi hand and flew beyond ani mark that had been
made yet minerva in the form of a man came and mark the place
where it had fallen a blind man sir said she could easili tell
your mark by grope for itit is so far ahead of ani other you mai
make your mind easi about thi contest for no phaeacian can come near
to such a throw as your
ulyss wa glad when he found he had a friend among the lookerson so
he began to speak more pleasantli young men said he come up to
that throw if you can and i will throw anoth disc as heavi or even
heavier if anyon want to have a bout with me let him come on for i
am exceedingli angri i will box wrestl or run i do not care what
it is with ani man of you all except laodama but not with him
becaus i am hi guest and on cannot compet with on own person
friend at least i do not think it a prudent or a sensibl thing for a
guest to challeng hi host famili at ani game especi when he is
in a foreign countri he will cut the ground from under hi own feet if
he doe but i make no except as regard ani on els for i want to
have the matter out and know which is the best man i am a good hand at
everi kind of athlet sport known among mankind i am an excel
archer in battl i am alwai the first to bring a man down with my
arrow no matter how mani more ar take aim at him alongsid of me
philoctet wa the onli man who could shoot better than i could when
we achaean were befor troi and in practic i far excel everi on
els in the whole world of those who still eat bread upon the face of
the earth but i should not like to shoot against the mighti dead such
as hercul or eurytu the oechalianmen who could shoot against the
god themselv thi in fact wa how eurytu came prematur by hi
end for apollo wa angri with him and kill him becaus he challeng
him as an archer i can throw a dart farther than ani on els can
shoot an arrow run is the onli point in respect of which i am
afraid some of the phaeacian might beat me for i have been brought
down veri low at sea my provis ran short and therefor i am still
weak
thei all held their peac except king alcin who began sir we
have had much pleasur in hear all that you have told us from which
i understand that you ar will to show your prowess as have been
displeas with some insol remark that have been made to you by on
of our athlet and which could never have been utter by ani on who
know how to talk with proprieti i hope you will apprehend my mean
and will explain to ani on of your chief men who mai be dine with
yourself and your famili when you get home that we have an hereditari
aptitud for accomplish of all kind we ar not particularli
remark for our box nor yet as wrestler but we ar singularli
fleet of foot and ar excel sailor we ar extrem fond of good
dinner music and danc we also like frequent chang of linen
warm bath and good bed so now pleas some of you who ar the best
dancer set about danc that our guest on hi return home mai be
abl to tell hi friend how much we surpass all other nation as
sailor runner dancer and minstrel demodocu ha left hi lyre
at my hous so run some on or other of you and fetch it for him
on thi a servant hurri off to bring the lyre from the king hous
and the nine men who had been chosen as steward stood forward it wa

thu sang the bard and both ulyss and the seafar phaeacian were
charm as thei heard him
then alcin told laodama and haliu to danc alon for there wa no

made for them and on of them bent himself backward and threw it up
toward the cloud while the other jump from off the ground and
caught it with eas befor it came down again when thei had done
throw the ball straight up into the air thei began to danc and at
the same time kept on throw it backward and forward to on
anoth while all the young men in the ring applaud and made a great
stamp with their feet then ulyss said
king alcin you said your peopl were the nimblest dancer in the
world and inde thei have prove themselv to be so i wa
astonish as i saw them
the king wa delight at thi and exclaim to the phaeacian

then aret told her maid to set a larg tripod upon the fire as fast
as thei could whereon thei set a tripod full of bath water on to a
clear fire thei threw on stick to make it blaze and the water becam
hot as the flame plai about the belli of the tripod71 meanwhil

alcin and said to ulyss
see to the lid yourself and have the whole bound round at onc for
fear ani on should rob you by the wai when you ar asleep in your
ship 72
when ulyss heard thi he put the lid on the chest and made it fast
with a bond that circ had taught him he had done so befor an upper
servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself he wa veri glad
of a warm bath for he had had no on to wait upon him ever sinc he
left the hous of calypso who as long as he remain with her had
taken as good care of him as though he had been a god when the
servant had done wash and anoint him with oil and had given him
a clean cloak and shirt he left the bath room and join the guest
who were sit over their wine love nausicaa stood by on of the
bearingpost support the roof of the cloister and admir him as
she saw him pass farewel stranger said she do not forget me when

for have save your life
and ulyss said nausicaa daughter of great alcin mai jove the
mighti husband of juno grant that i mai reach my home so shall i
bless you as my guardian angel all my dai for it wa you who save

when he had said thi he seat himself besid alcin supper wa
then serv and the wine wa mix for drink a servant led in the
favourit bard demodocu and set him in the midst of the compani near
on of the bearingpost support the cloister that he might lean
against it then ulyss cut off a piec of roast pork with plenti of
fat for there wa abund left on the joint and said to a servant
take thi piec of pork over to demodocu and tell him to eat it for
all the pain hi lai mai caus me i will salut him none the less
bard ar honour and respect throughout the world for the muse
teach them their song and love them
the servant carri the pork in hi finger over to demodocu who took
it and wa veri much pleas thei then laid their hand on the good
thing that were befor them and as soon as thei had had to eat and
drink ulyss said to demodocu demodocu there is no on in the
world whom i admir more than i do you you must have studi under the
muse jove daughter and under apollo so accur do you sing the
return of the achaean with all their suffer and adventur if you
were not there yourself you must have heard it all from some on who
wa now howev chang your song and tell us of the wooden hors
which epeu made with the assist of minerva and which ulyss got
by stratagem into the fort of troi after freight it with the men who
afterward sack the citi if you will sing thi tale aright i will
tell all the world how magnific heaven ha endow you
the bard inspir of heaven took up the stori at the point where some
of the argiv set fire to their tent and sail awai while other
hidden within the horse73 were wait with ulyss in the trojan
place of assembl for the trojan themselv had drawn the hors into
their fortress and it stood there while thei sat in council round it
and were in three mind as to what thei should do some were for
break it up then and there other would have it drag to the top
of the rock on which the fortress stood and then thrown down the
precipic while yet other were for let it remain as an offer
and propiti for the god and thi wa how thei settl it in the
end for the citi wa doom when it took in that hors within which
were all the bravest of the argiv wait to bring death and
destruct on the trojan anon he sang how the son of the achaean
issu from the hors and sack the town break out from their
ambuscad he sang how thei overran the citi hither and thither and
ravag it and how ulyss went rage like mar along with menelau
to the hous of deiphobu it wa there that the fight rage most
furious nevertheless by minerva help he wa victori
all thi he told but ulyss wa overcom as he heard him and hi
cheek were wet with tear he wept as a woman weep when she throw
herself on the bodi of her husband who ha fallen befor hi own citi
and peopl fight brave in defenc of hi home and children she
scream aloud and fling her arm about him as he li gasp for
breath and dy but her enemi beat her from behind about the back
and shoulder and carri her off into slaveri to a life of labour and
sorrow and the beauti fade from her cheekseven so piteous did
ulyss weep but none of those present perceiv hi tear except
alcin who wa sit near him and could hear the sob and sigh
that he wa heav the king therefor at onc rose and said
aldermen and town councillor of the phaeacian let demodocu ceas
hi song for there ar those present who do not seem to like it from
the moment that we had done supper and demodocu began to sing our
guest ha been all the time groan and lament he is evid in
great troubl so let the bard leav off that we mai all enjoi

book ix
ulyss declar himself and begin hi storyth cicon lotophagi
and cyclop
and ulyss answer king alcin it is a good thing to hear a bard
with such a divin voic as thi man ha there is noth better or
more delight than when a whole peopl make merri togeth with the
guest sit orderli to listen while the tabl is load with bread
and meat and the cupbear draw wine and fill hi cup for everi
man thi is inde as fair a sight as a man can see now howev
sinc you ar inclin to ask the stori of my sorrow and rekindl my
own sad memori in respect of them i do not know how to begin nor
yet how to continu and conclud my tale for the hand of heaven ha
been laid heavili upon me
firstli then i will tell you my name that you too mai know it and
on dai if i outliv thi time of sorrow mai becom my guest though
i live so far awai from all of you i am ulyss son of laert
renown among mankind for all manner of subtleti so that my fame
ascend to heaven i live in ithaca where there is a high mountain
call neritum cover with forest and not far from it there is a
group of island veri near to on anotherdulichium same and the
wood island of zacynthu it li squat on the horizon all highest
up in the sea toward the sunset while the other lie awai from it
toward dawn75 it is a rug island but it breed brave men and my
ey know none that thei better love to look upon the goddess calypso
kept me with her in her cave and want me to marri her as did also
the cun aeaean goddess circ but thei could neither of them
persuad me for there is noth dearer to a man than hi own countri
and hi parent and howev splendid a home he mai have in a foreign
countri if it be far from father or mother he doe not care about it
now howev i will tell you of the mani hazard adventur which by
jove will i met with on my return from troi
when i had set sail thenc the wind took me first to ismaru which is
the citi of the cicon there i sack the town and put the peopl to
the sword we took their wive and also much booti which we divid
equit amongst us so that none might have reason to complain i
then said that we had better make off at onc but my men veri
foolishli would not obei me so thei staid there drink much wine and
kill great number of sheep and oxen on the sea shore meanwhil the
cicon cri out for help to other cicon who live inland these were
more in number and stronger and thei were more skill in the art of
war for thei could fight either from chariot or on foot as the
occas serv in the morn therefor thei came as thick as
leav and bloom in summer and the hand of heaven wa against us so
that we were hard press thei set the battl in arrai near the ship
and the host aim their bronzeshod spear at on another76 so long
as the dai wax and it wa still morn we held our own against
them though thei were more in number than we but as the sun went
down toward the time when men loos their oxen the cicon got the
better of us and we lost half a dozen men from everi ship we had so
we got awai with those that were left
thenc we sail onward with sorrow in our heart but glad to have
escap death though we had lost our comrad nor did we leav till we
had thrice invok each on of the poor fellow who had perish by the
hand of the cicon then jove rais the north wind against us till it
blew a hurrican so that land and sky were hidden in thick cloud and
night sprang forth out of the heaven we let the ship run befor the
gale but the forc of the wind tore our sail to tatter so we took
them down for fear of shipwreck and row our hardest toward the
land there we lai two dai and two night suffer much alik from
toil and distress of mind but on the morn of the third dai we again
rais our mast set sail and took our place let the wind and
steersmen direct our ship i should have got home at that time unharm
had not the north wind and the current been against me as i wa
doubl cape malea and set me off my cours hard by the island of
cythera
i wa driven thenc by foul wind for a space of nine dai upon the
sea but on the tenth dai we reach the land of the lotuseat who
live on a food that come from a kind of flower here we land to take
in fresh water and our crew got their middai meal on the shore near
the ship when thei had eaten and drunk i sent two of my compani to
see what manner of men the peopl of the place might be and thei had a
third man under them thei start at onc and went about among the
lotuseat who did them no hurt but gave them to eat of the lotu
which wa so delici that those who at of it left off care about
home and did not even want to go back and sai what had happen to
them but were for stai and munch lotus77 with the lotuseat
without think further of their return nevertheless though thei
wept bitterli i forc them back to the ship and made them fast under
the bench then i told the rest to go on board at onc lest ani of
them should tast of the lotu and leav off want to get home so
thei took their place and smote the grei sea with their oar
we sail henc alwai in much distress till we came to the land of
the lawless and inhuman cyclop now the cyclop neither plant nor
plough but trust in provid and live on such wheat barlei and
grape as grow wild without ani kind of tillag and their wild grape
yield them wine as the sun and the rain mai grow them thei have no
law nor assembl of the peopl but live in cave on the top of
high mountain each is lord and master in hi famili and thei take no
account of their neighbour
now off their harbour there li a wood and fertil island not quit
close to the land of the cyclop but still not far it is overrun
with wild goat that breed there in great number and ar never
disturb by foot of man for sportsmenwho as a rule will suffer so
much hardship in forest or among mountain precipicesdo not go there
nor yet again is it ever plough or fed down but it li a wilder
until and unsown from year to year and ha no live thing upon it
but onli goat for the cyclop have no ship nor yet shipwright who
could make ship for them thei cannot therefor go from citi to citi
or sail over the sea to on anoth countri as peopl who have ship
can do if thei had had these thei would have colonis the island78
for it is a veri good on and would yield everyth in due season
there ar meadow that in some place come right down to the sea shore
well water and full of lusciou grass grape would do there
excel there is level land for plough and it would alwai
yield heavili at harvest time for the soil is deep there is a good
harbour where no cabl ar want nor yet anchor nor need a ship be
moor but all on ha to do is to beach on vessel and stai there
till the wind becom fair for put out to sea again at the head of
the harbour there is a spring of clear water come out of a cave and
there ar poplar grow all round it
here we enter but so dark wa the night that some god must have
brought us in for there wa noth whatev to be seen a thick mist
hung all round our ships79 the moon wa hidden behind a mass of cloud
so that no on could have seen the island if he had look for it nor
were there ani breaker to tell us we were close in shore befor we
found ourselv upon the land itself when howev we had beach the
ship we took down the sail went ashor and camp upon the beach
till daybreak
when the child of morn rosyfing dawn appear we admir the
island and wander all over it while the nymph jove daughter
rous the wild goat that we might get some meat for our dinner on
thi we fetch our spear and bow and arrow from the ship and
divid ourselv into three band began to shoot the goat heaven
sent us excel sport i had twelv ship with me and each ship got
nine goat while my own ship had ten thu through the livelong dai to
the go down of the sun we at and drank our fill and we had plenti
of wine left for each on of us had taken mani jar full when we
sack the citi of the cicon and thi had not yet run out while we
were feast we kept turn our ey toward the land of the
cyclop which wa hard by and saw the smoke of their stubbl fire
we could almost fanci we heard their voic and the bleat of their
sheep and goat but when the sun went down and it came on dark we
camp down upon the beach and next morn i call a council
stai here my brave fellow said i all the rest of you while i
go with my ship and exploit these peopl myself i want to see if thei
ar uncivilis savag or a hospit and human race
i went on board bid my men to do so also and loos the hawser
so thei took their place and smote the grei sea with their oar when
we got to the land which wa not far there on the face of a cliff
near the sea we saw a great cave overhung with laurel it wa a
station for a great mani sheep and goat and outsid there wa a larg
yard with a high wall round it made of stone built into the ground
and of tree both pine and oak thi wa the abod of a huge monster
who wa then awai from home shepherd hi flock he would have
noth to do with other peopl but led the life of an outlaw he wa
a horrid creatur not like a human be at all but resembl rather
some crag that stand out boldli against the sky on the top of a high
mountain
i told my men to draw the ship ashor and stai where thei were all
but the twelv best among them who were to go along with myself i
also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by
maron son of euanth who wa priest of apollo the patron god of
ismaru and live within the wood precinct of the templ when we
were sack the citi we respect him and spare hi life as also
hi wife and child so he made me some present of great valueseven
talent of fine gold and a bowl of silver with twelv jar of sweet
wine unblend and of the most exquisit flavour not a man nor maid
in the hous knew about it but onli himself hi wife and on
housekeep when he drank it he mix twenti part of water to on of
wine and yet the fragranc from the mixingbowl wa so exquisit that
it wa imposs to refrain from drink i fill a larg skin with
thi wine and took a wallet full of provis with me for my mind
misgav me that i might have to deal with some savag who would be of
great strength and would respect neither right nor law
we soon reach hi cave but he wa out shepherd so we went
insid and took stock of all that we could see hi cheeserack were
load with chees and he had more lamb and kid than hi pen could
hold thei were kept in separ flock first there were the hogget
then the oldest of the younger lamb and lastli the veri young ones80
all kept apart from on anoth as for hi dairi all the vessel
bowl and milk pail into which he milk were swim with whei
when thei saw all thi my men beg me to let them first steal some
chees and make off with them to the ship thei would then return
drive down the lamb and kid put them on board and sail awai with
them it would have been inde better if we had done so but i would
not listen to them for i want to see the owner himself in the hope
that he might give me a present when howev we saw him my poor men
found him ill to deal with
we lit a fire offer some of the chees in sacrific at other of
them and then sat wait till the cyclop should come in with hi
sheep when he came he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood
to light the fire for hi supper and thi he flung with such a nois
on to the floor of hi cave that we hid ourselv for fear at the far
end of the cavern meanwhil he drove all the ew insid as well as
the shegoat that he wa go to milk leav the male both ram
and hegoat outsid in the yard then he roll a huge stone to the
mouth of the caveso huge that two and twenti strong fourwheel
waggon would not be enough to draw it from it place against the
doorwai when he had so done he sat down and milk hi ew and goat
all in due cours and then let each of them have her own young he
curdl half the milk and set it asid in wicker strainer but the
other half he pour into bowl that he might drink it for hi supper
when he had got through with all hi work he lit the fire and then
caught sight of us whereon he said
stranger who ar you where do sail from ar you trader or do
you sail the sea as rover with your hand against everi man and
everi man hand against you
we were frighten out of our sens by hi loud voic and monstrou
form but i manag to sai we ar achaean on our wai home from troi
but by the will of jove and stress of weather we have been driven far
out of our cours we ar the peopl of agamemnon son of atreu who
ha won infinit renown throughout the whole world by sack so great
a citi and kill so mani peopl we therefor humbl prai you to show
us some hospit and otherwis make us such present as visitor
mai reason expect mai your excel fear the wrath of heaven
for we ar your suppliant and jove take all respect travel
under hi protect for he is the aveng of all suppliant and
foreign in distress
to thi he gave me but a pitiless answer stranger said he you
ar a fool or els you know noth of thi countri talk to me
inde about fear the god or shun their anger we cyclop do
not care about jove or ani of your bless god for we ar ever so
much stronger than thei i shall not spare either yourself or your
companion out of ani regard for jove unless i am in the humour for
do so and now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came
on shore wa it round the point or is she ly straight off the
land
he said thi to draw me out but i wa too cun to be caught in
that wai so i answer with a lie neptun said i sent my ship on
to the rock at the far end of your countri and wreck it we were
driven on to them from the open sea but i and those who ar with me
escap the jaw of death
the cruel wretch vouchsaf me not on word of answer but with a
sudden clutch he grip up two of my men at onc and dash them down
upon the ground as though thei had been puppi their brain were shed
upon the ground and the earth wa wet with their blood then he tore
them limb from limb and sup upon them he gobbl them up like a
lion in the wilder flesh bone marrow and entrail without
leav anyth uneaten as for us we wept and lift up our hand to
heaven on see such a horrid sight for we did not know what els to
do but when the cyclop had fill hi huge paunch and had wash
down hi meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk he stretch
himself full length upon the ground among hi sheep and went to sleep
i wa at first inclin to seiz my sword draw it and drive it into
hi vital but i reflect that if i did we should all certainli be
lost for we should never be abl to shift the stone which the monster
had put in front of the door so we stai sob and sigh where we
were till morn came
when the child of morn rosyfing dawn appear he again lit
hi fire milk hi goat and ew all quit rightli and then let
each have her own young on as soon as he had got through with all hi
work he clutch up two more of my men and began eat them for hi
morn meal present with the utmost eas he roll the stone
awai from the door and drove out hi sheep but he at onc put it back
againa easili as though he were mere clap the lid on to a
quiver full of arrow as soon as he had done so he shout and cri
shoo shoo after hi sheep to drive them on to the mountain so i
wa left to scheme some wai of take my reveng and cover myself
with glori
in the end i deem it would be the best plan to do as follow the
cyclop had a great club which wa ly near on of the sheep pen it
wa of green oliv wood and he had cut it intend to us it for a
staff as soon as it should be dry it wa so huge that we could onli
compar it to the mast of a twentyoar merchant vessel of larg
burden and abl to ventur out into open sea i went up to thi club
and cut off about six feet of it i then gave thi piec to the men and
told them to fine it evenli off at on end which thei proceed to do
and lastli i brought it to a point myself char the end in the fire
to make it harder when i had done thi i hid it under dung which wa
ly about all over the cave and told the men to cast lot which of
them should ventur along with myself to lift it and bore it into the
monster ey while he wa asleep the lot fell upon the veri four whom
i should have chosen and i myself made five in the even the wretch
came back from shepherd and drove hi flock into the cavethi
time drive them all insid and not leav ani in the yard i
suppos some fanci must have taken him or a god must have prompt him
to do so as soon as he had put the stone back to it place against the
door he sat down milk hi ew and hi goat all quit rightli and
then let each have her own young on when he had got through with all
thi work he grip up two more of my men and made hi supper off
them so i went up to him with an ivywood bowl of black wine in my
hand
look here cyclop said i you have been eat a great deal of
man flesh so take thi and drink some wine that you mai see what
kind of liquor we had on board my ship i wa bring it to you as a
drinkoff in the hope that you would take compass upon me and
further me on my wai home wherea all you do is to go on ramp and
rave most intoler you ought to be asham of yourself how can
you expect peopl to come see you ani more if you treat them in thi
wai
he then took the cup and drank he wa so delight with the tast of
the wine that he beg me for anoth bowl full be so kind he
said as to give me some more and tell me your name at onc i want
to make you a present that you will be glad to have we have wine even
in thi countri for our soil grow grape and the sun ripen them but
thi drink like nectar and ambrosia all in on
i then gave him some more three time did i fill the bowl for him
and three time did he drain it without thought or heed then when i
saw that the wine had got into hi head i said to him as plausibl as
i could cyclop you ask my name and i will tell it you give me
therefor the present you promis me my name is noman thi is what
my father and mother and my friend have alwai call me
but the cruel wretch said then i will eat all noman comrad
befor noman himself and will keep noman for the last thi is the
present that i will make him
as he spoke he reel and fell sprawl face upward on the ground
hi great neck hung heavili backward and a deep sleep took hold upon
him present he turn sick and threw up both wine and the gobbet
of human flesh on which he had been gorg for he wa veri drunk
then i thrust the beam of wood far into the ember to heat it and
encourag my men lest ani of them should turn faintheart when the
wood green though it wa wa about to blaze i drew it out of the
fire glow with heat and my men gather round me for heaven had
fill their heart with courag we drove the sharp end of the beam
into the monster ey and bear upon it with all my weight i kept
turn it round and round as though i were bore a hole in a ship
plank with an auger which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on
turn as long as thei choos even thu did we bore the red hot beam
into hi ey till the boil blood bubbl all over it as we work
it round and round so that the steam from the burn eyebal scald
hi eyelid and eyebrow and the root of the ey sputter in the
fire as a blacksmith plung an ax or hatchet into cold water to
temper itfor it is thi that give strength to the ironand it make a
great hiss as he doe so even thu did the cyclop ey hiss round the
beam of oliv wood and hi hideou yell made the cave ring again we
ran awai in a fright but he pluck the beam all besmirch with gore
from hi ey and hurl it from him in a frenzi of rage and pain
shout as he did so to the other cyclop who live on the bleak
headland near him so thei gather from all quarter round hi cave
when thei heard him cry and ask what wa the matter with him
what ail you polyphemu said thei that you make such a nois
break the still of the night and prevent us from be abl
to sleep sure no man is carri off your sheep sure no man is
try to kill you either by fraud or by forc
but polyphemu shout to them from insid the cave noman is kill
me by fraud no man is kill me by forc
then said thei if no man is attack you you must be ill when
jove make peopl ill there is no help for it and you had better prai
to your father neptun
then thei went awai and i laugh inwardli at the success of my
clever stratagem but the cyclop groan and in an agoni of pain
felt about with hi hand till he found the stone and took it from the
door then he sat in the doorwai and stretch hi hand in front of it
to catch anyon go out with the sheep for he thought i might be
foolish enough to attempt thi
as for myself i kept on puzzl to think how i could best save my own
life and those of my companion i scheme and scheme as on who
know that hi life depend upon it for the danger wa veri great in
the end i deem that thi plan would be the best the male sheep were
well grown and carri a heavi black fleec so i bound them
noiselessli in three togeth with some of the withi on which the
wick monster us to sleep there wa to be a man under the middl
sheep and the two on either side were to cover him so that there were
three sheep to each man as for myself there wa a ram finer than ani
of the other so i caught hold of him by the back esconc myself in
the thick wool under hi belli and hung on patient to hi fleec
face upward keep a firm hold on it all the time
thu then did we wait in great fear of mind till morn came but
when the child of morn rosyfing dawn appear the male sheep
hurri out to feed while the ew remain bleat about the pen
wait to be milk for their udder were full to burst but their
master in spite of all hi pain felt the back of all the sheep as thei
stood upright without be sharp enough to find out that the men were
underneath their belli as the ram wa go out last of all heavi
with it fleec and with the weight of my crafti self polyphemu laid
hold of it and said
my good ram what is it that make you the last to leav my cave thi
morn you ar not wont to let the ew go befor you but lead the
mob with a run whether to floweri mead or bubbl fountain and ar
the first to come home again at night but now you lag last of all is
it becaus you know your master ha lost hi ey and ar sorri becaus
that wick noman and hi horrid crew ha got him down in hi drink and
blind him but i will have hi life yet if you could understand and
talk you would tell me where the wretch is hide and i would dash
hi brain upon the ground till thei flew all over the cave i should
thu have some satisfact for the harm thi nogood noman ha done
me
as he spoke he drove the ram outsid but when we were a littl wai
out from the cave and yard i first got from under the ram belli
and then freed my comrad as for the sheep which were veri fat by
constantli head them in the right direct we manag to drive them
down to the ship the crew rejoic greatli at see those of us who
had escap death but wept for the other whom the cyclop had kill
howev i made sign to them by nod and frown that thei were to
hush their cry and told them to get all the sheep on board at onc
and put out to sea so thei went aboard took their place and smote
the grei sea with their oar then when i had got as far out as my
voic would reach i began to jeer at the cyclop
cyclop said i you should have taken better measur of your man
befor eat up hi comrad in your cave you wretch eat up your
visitor in your own hous you might have known that your sin would
find you out and now jove and the other god have punish you
he got more and more furiou as he heard me so he tore the top from
off a high mountain and flung it just in front of my ship so that it
wa within a littl of hit the end of the rudder81 the sea quak
as the rock fell into it and the wash of the wave it rais carri us
back toward the mainland and forc us toward the shore but i
snatch up a long pole and kept the ship off make sign to my men
by nod my head that thei must row for their live whereon thei
laid out with a will when we had got twice as far as we were befor i
wa for jeer at the cyclop again but the men beg and prai of
me to hold my tongu
do not thei exclaim be mad enough to provok thi savag
creatur further he ha thrown on rock at us alreadi which drove us
back again to the mainland and we made sure it had been the death of
us if he had then heard ani further sound of voic he would have
pound our head and our ship timber into a jelli with the rug
rock he would have heav at us for he can throw them a long wai
but i would not listen to them and shout out to him in my rage
cyclop if ani on ask you who it wa that put your ey out and
spoil your beauti sai it wa the valiant warrior ulyss son of
laert who live in ithaca
on thi he groan and cri out ala ala then the old propheci
about me is come true there wa a prophet here at on time a man
both brave and of great statur telemu son of eurymu who wa an
excel seer and did all the prophesi for the cyclop till he
grew old he told me that all thi would happen to me some dai and
said i should lose my sight by the hand of ulyss i have been all
along expect some on of impos presenc and superhuman strength
wherea he turn out to be a littl insignific weakl who ha
manag to blind my ey by take advantag of me in my drink come
here then ulyss that i mai make you present to show my
hospit and urg neptun to help you forward on your journeyfor
neptun and i ar father and son he if he so will shall heal me
which no on els neither god nor man can do
then i said i wish i could be as sure of kill you outright and
send you down to the hous of hade as i am that it will take more
than neptun to cure that ey of your
on thi he lift up hi hand to the firmament of heaven and prai
sai hear me great neptun if i am inde your own true begotten
son grant that ulyss mai never reach hi home aliv or if he must
get back to hi friend at last let him do so late and in sore plight
after lose all hi men let him reach hi home in anoth man ship
and find troubl in hi house82
thu did he prai and neptun heard hi prayer then he pick up a
rock much larger than the first swung it aloft and hurl it with
prodigi forc it fell just short of the ship but wa within a
littl of hit the end of the rudder the sea quak as the rock
fell into it and the wash of the wave it rais drove us onward on
our wai toward the shore of the island
when at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our
ship we found our comrad lament us and anxious await our
return we ran our vessel upon the sand and got out of her on to the
sea shore we also land the cyclop sheep and divid them
equit amongst us so that none might have reason to complain as for
the ram my companion agre that i should have it as an extra share
so i sacrif it on the sea shore and burn it thigh bone to
jove who is the lord of all but he heed not my sacrific and onli
thought how he might destroi both my ship and my comrad
thu through the livelong dai to the go down of the sun we feast
our fill on meat and drink but when the sun went down and it came on
dark we camp upon the beach when the child of morn rosyfing
dawn appear i bade my men on board and loos the hawser then thei
took their place and smote the grei sea with their oar so we sail
on with sorrow in our heart but glad to have escap death though we
had lost our comrad
book x
aeolu the laestrygon circ
thenc we went on to the aeolian island where live aeolu son of
hippota dear to the immort god it is an island that float as it
were upon the sea83 iron bound with a wall that gird it now aeolu
ha six daughter and six lusti son so he made the son marri the
daughter and thei all live with their dear father and mother
feast and enjoi everi conceiv kind of luxuri all dai long
the atmospher of the hous is load with the savour of roast meat
till it groan again yard and all but by night thei sleep on their
well made bedstead each with hi own wife between the blanket these
were the peopl among whom we had now come
aeolu entertain me for a whole month ask me question all the
time about troi the argiv fleet and the return of the achaean i
told him exactli how everyth had happen and when i said i must
go and ask him to further me on my wai he made no sort of
difficulti but set about do so at onc moreov he flai me a
prime oxhid to hold the wai of the roar wind which he shut up
in the hide as in a sackfor jove had made him captain over the wind
and he could stir or still each on of them accord to hi own
pleasur he put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightli
with a silver thread that not even a breath of a sidewind could blow
from ani quarter the west wind which wa fair for us did he alon let
blow as it chose but it all came to noth for we were lost through
our own folli
nine dai and nine night did we sail and on the tenth dai our nativ
land show on the horizon we got so close in that we could see the
stubbl fire burn and i be then dead beat fell into a light
sleep for i had never let the rudder out of my own hand that we
might get home the faster on thi the men fell to talk among
themselv and said i wa bring back gold and silver in the sack
that aeolu had given me bless my heart would on turn to hi
neighbour sai how thi man get honour and make friend to
whatev citi or countri he mai go see what fine prize he is take
home from troi while we who have travel just as far as he ha
come back with hand as empti as we set out withand now aeolu ha
given him ever so much more quicklet us see what it all is and how
much gold and silver there is in the sack he gave him
thu thei talk and evil counsel prevail thei loos the sack
whereupon the wind flew howl forth and rais a storm that carri
us weep out to sea and awai from our own countri then i awok and
knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make
the best of it but i bore it cover myself up and lai down in the
ship while the men lament bitterli as the fierc wind bore our
fleet back to the aeolian island
when we reach it we went ashor to take in water and dine hard by
the ship immedi after dinner i took a herald and on of my men
and went straight to the hous of aeolu where i found him feast
with hi wife and famili so we sat down as suppliant on the
threshold thei were astound when thei saw us and said ulyss
what bring you here what god ha been illtreat you we took great
pain to further you on your wai home to ithaca or wherev it wa
that you want to go to
thu did thei speak but i answer sorrowfulli my men have undon
me thei and cruel sleep have ruin me my friend mend me thi
mischief for you can if you will
i spoke as movingli as i could but thei said noth till their
father answer vilest of mankind get you gone at onc out of the
island him whom heaven hate will i in no wise help be off for you
come here as on abhor of heaven and with these word he sent me
sorrow from hi door
thenc we sail sadli on till the men were worn out with long and
fruitless row for there wa no longer ani wind to help them six
dai night and dai did we toil and on the seventh dai we reach the
rocki stronghold of lamustelepylu the citi of the laestrygonian
where the shepherd who is drive in hi sheep and goat to be milk
salut him who is drive out hi flock to feed and thi last
answer the salut in that countri a man who could do without sleep
might earn doubl wage on as a herdsman of cattl and anoth as a
shepherd for thei work much the same by night as thei do by day84
when we reach the harbour we found it landlock under steep
cliff with a narrow entranc between two headland my captain took
all their ship insid and made them fast close to on anoth for
there wa never so much as a breath of wind insid but it wa alwai
dead calm i kept my own ship outsid and moor it to a rock at the
veri end of the point then i climb a high rock to reconnoitr but
could see no sign neither of man nor cattl onli some smoke rise
from the ground so i sent two of my compani with an attend to find
out what sort of peopl the inhabit were
the men when thei got on shore follow a level road by which the
peopl draw their firewood from the mountain into the town till
present thei met a young woman who had come outsid to fetch water
and who wa daughter to a laestrygonian name antiph she wa go
to the fountain artacia from which the peopl bring in their water and
when my men had come close up to her thei ask her who the king of
that countri might be and over what kind of peopl he rule so she
direct them to her father hous but when thei got there thei found
hi wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain and thei were
horrifi at the sight of her
she at onc call her husband antiph from the place of assembl
and forthwith he set about kill my men he snatch up on of them
and began to make hi dinner off him then and there whereon the other
two ran back to the ship as fast as ever thei could but antiph
rais a hueandcri after them and thousand of sturdi laestrygonian
sprang up from everi quarterogr not men thei threw vast rock at
us from the cliff as though thei had been mere stone and i heard the
horrid sound of the ship crunch up against on anoth and the
death cri of my men as the laestrygonian spear them like fish
and took them home to eat them while thei were thu kill my men
within the harbour i drew my sword cut the cabl of my own ship and
told my men to row with all their might if thei too would not fare like
the rest so thei laid out for their live and we were thank enough
when we got into open water out of reach of the rock thei hurl at
us as for the other there wa not on of them left
thenc we sail sadli on glad to have escap death though we had
lost our comrad and came to the aeaean island where circ livesa
great and cun goddess who is own sister to the magician aeetesfor
thei ar both children of the sun by pers who is daughter to oceanu
we brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word for some god
guid us thither and have land we lai there for two dai and two
night worn out in bodi and mind when the morn of the third dai
came i took my spear and my sword and went awai from the ship to
reconnoitr and see if i could discov sign of human handiwork or
hear the sound of voic climb to the top of a high lookout i
espi the smoke of circ hous rise upward amid a dens forest of
tree and when i saw thi i doubt whether have seen the smoke i
would not go on at onc and find out more but in the end i deem it
best to go back to the ship give the men their dinner and send some
of them instead of go myself
when i had nearli got back to the ship some god took piti upon my
solitud and sent a fine antler stag right into the middl of my
path he wa come down hi pastur in the forest to drink of the
river for the heat of the sun drove him and as he pass i struck him
in the middl of the back the bronz point of the spear went clean
through him and he lai groan in the dust until the life went out of
him then i set my foot upon him drew my spear from the wound and
laid it down i also gather rough grass and rush and twist them
into a fathom or so of good stout rope with which i bound the four
feet of the nobl creatur togeth have so done i hung him round my
neck and walk back to the ship lean upon my spear for the stag
wa much too big for me to be abl to carri him on my shoulder
steadi him with on hand as i threw him down in front of the ship
i call the men and spoke cheeringli man by man to each of them look
here my friend said i we ar not go to die so much befor our
time after all and at ani rate we will not starv so long as we have
got someth to eat and drink on board on thi thei uncov their
head upon the sea shore and admir the stag for he wa inde a
splendid fellow then when thei had feast their ey upon him
suffici thei wash their hand and began to cook him for dinner
thu through the livelong dai to the go down of the sun we stai
there eat and drink our fill but when the sun went down and it
came on dark we camp upon the sea shore when the child of morn
rosyfing dawn appear i call a council and said my friend
we ar in veri great difficulti listen therefor to me we have no
idea where the sun either set or rises85 so that we do not even know
east from west i see no wai out of it nevertheless we must try and
find on we ar certainli on an island for i went as high as i could
thi morn and saw the sea reach all round it to the horizon it
li low but toward the middl i saw smoke rise from out of a thick
forest of tree
their heart sank as thei heard me for thei rememb how thei had
been treat by the laestrygonian antiph and by the savag ogr
polyphemu thei wept bitterli in their dismai but there wa noth
to be got by cry so i divid them into two compani and set a
captain over each i gave on compani to eurylochu while i took
command of the other myself then we cast lot in a helmet and the lot
fell upon eurylochu so he set out with hi twentytwo men and thei
wept as also did we who were left behind
when thei reach circ hous thei found it built of cut stone on
a site that could be seen from far in the middl of the forest there
were wild mountain wolv and lion prowl all round itpoor
bewitch creatur whom she had tame by her enchant and drug
into subject thei did not attack my men but wag their great
tail fawn upon them and rub their nose lovingli against
them86 as hound crowd round their master when thei see him come
from dinnerfor thei know he will bring them somethingeven so did
these wolv and lion with their great claw fawn upon my men but the
men were terribl frighten at see such strang creatur
present thei reach the gate of the goddesss hous and as thei
stood there thei could hear circ within sing most beautifulli as
she work at her loom make a web so fine so soft and of such
dazzl colour as no on but a goddess could weav on thi polit
whom i valu and trust more than ani other of my men said there
is some on insid work at a loom and sing most beautifulli the
whole place resound with it let us call her and see whether she is
woman or goddess
thei call her and she came down unfasten the door and bade them
enter thei think no evil follow her all except eurylochu who
suspect mischief and staid outsid when she had got them into her
hous she set them upon bench and seat and mix them a mess with
chees honei meal and pramnian wine but she drug it with wick
poison to make them forget their home and when thei had drunk she
turn them into pig by a stroke of her wand and shut them up in her
pigsty thei were like pigshead hair and all and thei grunt
just as pig do but their sens were the same as befor and thei
rememb everyth
thu then were thei shut up squeal and circ threw them some
acorn and beech mast such as pig eat but eurylochu hurri back to
tell me about the sad fate of our comrad he wa so overcom with
dismai that though he tri to speak he could find no word to do so
hi ey fill with tear and he could onli sob and sigh till at last
we forc hi stori out of him and he told us what had happen to the
other
we went said he as you told us through the forest and in the
middl of it there wa a fine hous built with cut stone in a place
that could be seen from far there we found a woman or els she wa a
goddess work at her loom and sing sweetli so the men shout to
her and call her whereon she at onc came down open the door and
invit us in the other did not suspect ani mischief so thei follow
her into the hous but i staid where i wa for i thought there might
be some treacheri from that moment i saw them no more for not on of
them ever came out though i sat a long time watch for them
then i took my sword of bronz and slung it over my shoulder i also
took my bow and told eurylochu to come back with me and shew me the
wai but he laid hold of me with both hi hand and spoke piteous
sai sir do not forc me to go with you but let me stai here for
i know you will not bring on of them back with you nor even return
aliv yourself let us rather see if we cannot escap at ani rate with
the few that ar left us for we mai still save our live
stai where you ar then answer i eat and drink at the
ship but i must go for i am most urgent bound to do so
with thi i left the ship and went up inland when i got through the
charm grove and wa near the great hous of the enchantress circ i
met mercuri with hi golden wand disguis as a young man in the
heydai of hi youth and beauti with the down just come upon hi
face he came up to me and took my hand within hi own sai my
poor unhappi man whither ar you go over thi mountain top alon
and without know the wai your men ar shut up in circ pigsty
like so mani wild boar in their lair you sure do not fanci that
you can set them free i can tell you that you will never get back and
will have to stai there with the rest of them but never mind i will
protect you and get you out of your difficulti take thi herb which
is on of great virtu and keep it about you when you go to circ
hous it will be a talisman to you against everi kind of mischief
and i will tell you of all the wick witchcraft that circ will try
to practic upon you she will mix a mess for you to drink and she
will drug the meal with which she make it but she will not be abl to
charm you for the virtu of the herb that i shall give you will
prevent her spell from work i will tell you all about it when
circ strike you with her wand draw your sword and spring upon her as
though you were go to kill her she will then be frighten and
will desir you to go to bed with her on thi you must not point blank
refus her for you want her to set your companion free and to take
good care also of yourself but you must make her swear solemnli by all
the bless god that she will plot no further mischief against you or
els when she ha got you nake she will unman you and make you fit for
noth
as he spoke he pull the herb out of the ground and shew me what it
wa like the root wa black while the flower wa as white as milk
the god call it moli and mortal men cannot uproot it but the god
can do whatev thei like
then mercuri went back to high olympu pass over the wood island
but i fare onward to the hous of circ and my heart wa cloud with
care as i walk along when i got to the gate i stood there and
call the goddess and as soon as she heard me she came down open
the door and ask me to come in so i follow hermuch troubl in
my mind she set me on a richli decor seat inlaid with silver
there wa a footstool also under my feet and she mix a mess in a
golden goblet for me to drink but she drug it for she meant me
mischief when she had given it me and i had drunk it without it
charm me she struck me with her wand there now she cri be
off to the pigsty and make your lair with the rest of them
but i rush at her with my sword drawn as though i would kill her
whereon she fell with a loud scream clasp my knee and spoke
piteous sai who and whenc ar you from what place and peopl
have you come how can it be that my drug have no power to charm you
never yet wa ani man abl to stand so much as a tast of the herb i
gave you you must be spellproof sure you can be none other than
the bold hero ulyss who mercuri alwai said would come here some dai
with hi ship while on hi wai home from troi so be it then sheath
your sword and let us go to bed that we mai make friend and learn to
trust each other
and i answer circ how can you expect me to be friendli with you
when you have just been turn all my men into pig and now that you
have got me here myself you mean me mischief when you ask me to go to
bed with you and will unman me and make me fit for noth i shall
certainli not consent to go to bed with you unless you will first take
your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me
so she swore at onc as i had told her and when she had complet her
oath then i went to bed with her
meanwhil her four servant who ar her housemaid set about their
work thei ar the children of the grove and fountain and of the
holi water that run down into the sea on of them spread a fair
purpl cloth over a seat and laid a carpet underneath it anoth
brought tabl of silver up to the seat and set them with basket of
gold a third mix some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put
golden cup upon the tabl while the fourth brought in water and set
it to boil in a larg cauldron over a good fire which she had light
when the water in the cauldron wa boiling87 she pour cold into it
till it wa just as i like it and then she set me in a bath and began
wash me from the cauldron about the head and shoulder to take the
tire and stiff out of my limb as soon as she had done wash me
and anoint me with oil she arrai me in a good cloak and shirt and
led me to a richli decor seat inlaid with silver there wa a
footstool also under my feet a maid servant then brought me water in a
beauti golden ewer and pour it into a silver basin for me to wash
my hand and she drew a clean tabl besid me an upper servant
brought me bread and offer me mani thing of what there wa in the
hous and then circ bade me eat but i would not and sat without
heed what wa befor me still moodi and suspici
when circ saw me sit there without eat and in great grief
she came to me and said ulyss why do you sit like that as though
you were dumb gnaw at your own heart and refus both meat and
drink is it that you ar still suspici you ought not to be for i
have alreadi sworn solemnli that i will not hurt you
and i said circ no man with ani sens of what is right can think
of either eat or drink in your hous until you have set hi
friend free and let him see them if you want me to eat and drink you
must free my men and bring them to me that i mai see them with my own
ey
when i had said thi she went straight through the court with her wand
in her hand and open the pigsty door my men came out like so mani
prime hog and stood look at her but she went about among them and
anoint each with a second drug whereon the bristl that the bad
drug had given them fell off and thei becam men again younger than
thei were befor and much taller and better look thei knew me at
onc seiz me each of them by the hand and wept for joi till the
whole hous wa fill with the sound of their halloaballoo and
circ herself wa so sorri for them that she came up to me and said
ulyss nobl son of laert go back at onc to the sea where you
have left your ship and first draw it on to the land then hide all
your ship gear and properti in some cave and come back here with
your men

with a strang kind of scream sound that made me turn pale with
fear when i saw them come i told the men to be quick and flai the
carcass of the two dead sheep and make burnt offer of them and
at the same time to repeat prayer to hade and to proserpin but i
sat where i wa with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless
ghost come near the blood till teiresia should have answer my
question
the first ghost that came wa that of my comrad elpenor for he had

in ani storm of neptun rais nor did my foe despatch me upon the
mainland but aegisthu and my wick wife were the death of me between
them he ask me to hi hous feast me and then butcher me most
miser as though i were a fat beast in a slaughter hous while all
around me my comrad were slain like sheep or pig for the wed
breakfast or picnic or gorgeou banquet of some great nobleman you
must have seen number of men kill either in a gener engag or
in singl combat but you never saw anyth so truli pitiabl as the
wai in which we fell in that cloister with the mix bowl and the
load tabl ly all about and the ground reek with our blood i
heard priam daughter cassandra scream as clytemnestra kill her
close besid me i lai dy upon the earth with the sword in my bodi
and rais my hand to kill the slut of a murderess but she slip

even with your own wife do not tell her all that you know perfectli
well yourself tell her a part onli and keep your own counsel about

penelop is a veri admir woman and ha an excel natur we
left her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for

first to speak and hi judgement wa uner nestor and i were the
onli two who could surpass him and when it came to fight on the
plain of troi he would never remain with the bodi of hi men but
would dash on far in front foremost of them all in valour mani a man
did he kill in battlei cannot name everi singl on of those whom he
slew while fight on the side of the argiv but will onli sai how
he kill that valiant hero eurypylu son of telephu who wa the
handsomest man i ever saw except memnon mani other also of the
ceteian fell around him by reason of a woman bribe moreov when
all the bravest of the argiv went insid the hors that epeu had
made and it wa left to me to settl when we should either open the
door of our ambuscad or close it though all the other leader and
chief men among the danaan were dry their ey and quak in everi
limb i never onc saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from hi cheek he
wa all the time urg me to break out from the horsegrasp the
handl of hi sword and hi bronzeshod spear and breath furi
against the foe yet when we had sack the citi of priam he got hi
handsom share of the prize monei and went on board such is the
fortun of war without a wound upon him neither from a thrown spear
nor in close combat for the rage of mar is a matter of great chanc
when i had told him thi the ghost of achil strode off across a
meadow full of asphodel exult over what i had said concern the
prowess of hi son
the ghost of other dead men stood near me and told me each hi own
melancholi tale but that of ajax son of telamon alon held aloofstil
angri with me for have won the caus in our disput about the armour
of achil theti had offer it as a prize but the trojan prison
and minerva were the judg would that i had never gain the dai in
such a contest for it cost the life of ajax who wa foremost of all
the danaan after the son of peleu alik in statur and prowess
when i saw him i tri to pacifi him and said ajax will you not
forget and forgiv even in death but must the judgement about that
hate armour still rankl with you it cost us argiv dear enough to
lose such a tower of strength as you were to us we mourn you as much
as we mourn achil son of peleu himself nor can the blame be laid
on anyth but on the spite which jove bore against the danaan for
it wa thi that made him counsel your destructioncom hither
therefor bring your proud spirit into subject and hear what i can
tell you
he would not answer but turn awai to erebu and to the other
ghost nevertheless i should have made him talk to me in spite of hi
be so angri or i should have gone on talk to him97 onli that
there were still other among the dead whom i desir to see
then i saw mino son of jove with hi golden sceptr in hi hand
sit in judgement on the dead and the ghost were gather sit
and stand round him in the spaciou hous of hade to learn hi
sentenc upon them
after him i saw huge orion in a meadow full of asphodel drive the
ghost of the wild beast that he had kill upon the mountain and he
had a great bronz club in hi hand unbreak for ever and ever
and i saw tityu son of gaia stretch upon the plain and cover
some nine acr of ground two vultur on either side of him were
dig their beak into hi liver and he kept on try to beat them
off with hi hand but could not for he had violat jove mistress
leto as she wa go through panopeu on her wai to pytho
i saw also the dread fate of tantalu who stood in a lake that
reach hi chin he wa dy to quench hi thirst but could never
reach the water for whenev the poor creatur stoop to drink it
dri up and vanish so that there wa noth but dry groundparch
by the spite of heaven there were tall tree moreov that shed
their fruit over hi headpear pomegran appl sweet fig and
juici oliv but whenev the poor creatur stretch out hi hand to
take some the wind toss the branch back again to the cloud
and i saw sisyphu at hi endless task rais hi prodigi stone
with both hi hand with hand and feet he tri to roll it up to the
top of the hill but alwai just befor he could roll it over on to
the other side it weight would be too much for him and the pitiless
stone98 would come thunder down again on to the plain then he would
begin try to push it up hill again and the sweat ran off him and
the steam rose after him
after him i saw mighti hercul but it wa hi phantom onli for he
is feast ever with the immort god and ha love hebe to wife
who is daughter of jove and juno the ghost were scream round him
like scare bird fly all whither he look black as night with
hi bare bow in hi hand and hi arrow on the string glare around
as though ever on the point of take aim about hi breast there wa a
wondrou golden belt adorn in the most marvel fashion with bear
wild boar and lion with gleam ey there wa also war battl
and death the man who made that belt do what he might would never be
abl to make anoth like it hercul knew me at onc when he saw me
and spoke piteous sai my poor ulyss nobl son of laert
ar you too lead the same sorri kind of life that i did when i wa
abov ground i wa son of jove but i went through an infin of
suffer for i becam bondsman to on who wa far beneath mea low
fellow who set me all manner of labour he onc sent me here to fetch
the hellhoundfor he did not think he could find anyth harder for
me than thi but i got the hound out of hade and brought him to him
for mercuri and minerva help me
on thi hercul went down again into the hous of hade but i stai
where i wa in case some other of the mighti dead should come to me
and i should have seen still other of them that ar gone befor whom i
would fain have seentheseu and pirithousglori children of the
god but so mani thousand of ghost came round me and utter such
appal cri that i wa panic stricken lest proserpin should send
up from the hous of hade the head of that aw monster gorgon on
thi i hasten back to my ship and order my men to go on board at
onc and loos the hawser so thei embark and took their place
whereon the ship went down the stream of the river oceanu we had to
row at first but present a fair wind sprang up
book xii
the siren scylla and charybdi the cattl of the sun
after we were clear of the river oceanu and had got out into the
open sea we went on till we reach the aeaean island where there is
dawn and sunris as in other place we then drew our ship on to the
sand and got out of her on to the shore where we went to sleep and
wait till dai should break
then when the child of morn rosyfing dawn appear i sent
some men to circ hous to fetch the bodi of elpenor we cut firewood
from a wood where the headland jut out into the sea and after we
had wept over him and lament him we perform hi funer rite when
hi bodi and armour had been burn to ash we rais a cairn set a
stone over it and at the top of the cairn we fix the oar that he had
been us to row with
while we were do all thi circ who knew that we had got back
from the hous of hade dress herself and came to us as fast as she
could and her maid servant came with her bring us bread meat and
wine then she stood in the midst of us and said you have done a bold
thing in go down aliv to the hous of hade and you will have di
twice to other peopl onc now then stai here for the rest of the
dai feast your fill and go on with your voyag at daybreak tomorrow
morn in the meantim i will tell ulyss about your cours and
will explain everyth to him so as to prevent your suffer from
misadventur either by land or sea
we agre to do as she had said and feast through the livelong dai
to the go down of the sun but when the sun had set and it came on
dark the men laid themselv down to sleep by the stern cabl of the
ship then circ took me by the hand and bade me be seat awai from
the other while she reclin by my side and ask me all about our
adventur
so far so good said she when i had end my stori and now pai
attent to what i am about to tell youheaven itself inde will
recal it to your recollect first you will come to the siren who
enchant all who come near them if ani on unwarili draw in too close
and hear the sing of the siren hi wife and children will never
welcom him home again for thei sit in a green field and warbl him to
death with the sweet of their song there is a great heap of dead
men bone ly all around with the flesh still rot off them
therefor pass these siren by and stop your men ear with wax that
none of them mai hear but if you like you can listen yourself for you
mai get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross piec half
wai up the mast99 and thei must lash the rope end to the mast
itself that you mai have the pleasur of listen if you beg and
prai the men to unloos you then thei must bind you faster
when your crew have taken you past these siren i cannot give you
coher directions100 as to which of two cours you ar to take i
will lai the two altern befor you and you must consid them
for yourself on the on hand there ar some overhang rock against
which the deep blue wave of amphitrit beat with terrif furi the
bless god call these rock the wander here not even a bird mai
pass no not even the timid dove that bring ambrosia to father jove
but the sheer rock alwai carri off on of them and father jove ha
to send anoth to make up their number no ship that ever yet came to
these rock ha got awai again but the wave and whirlwind of fire
ar freight with wreckag and with the bodi of dead men the onli
vessel that ever sail and got through wa the famou argo on her wai
from the hous of aet and she too would have gone against these
great rock onli that juno pilot her past them for the love she bore
to jason
of these two rock the on reach heaven and it peak is lost in a
dark cloud thi never leav it so that the top is never clear not
even in summer and earli autumn no man though he had twenti hand and
twenti feet could get a foothold on it and climb it for it run sheer
up as smooth as though it had been polish in the middl of it there
is a larg cavern look west and turn toward erebu you must
take your ship thi wai but the cave is so high up that not even the
stoutest archer could send an arrow into it insid it scylla sit and
yelp with a voic that you might take to be that of a young hound but
in truth she is a dread monster and no onenot even a godcould face
her without be terrorstruck she ha twelv misshapen feet and
six neck of the most prodigi length and at the end of each neck
she ha a fright head with three row of teeth in each all set veri
close togeth so that thei would crunch ani on to death in a moment
and she sit deep within her shadi cell thrust out her head and
peer all round the rock fish for dolphin or dogfish or ani
larger monster that she can catch of the thousand with which
amphitrit teem no ship ever yet got past her without lose some
men for she shoot out all her head at onc and carri off a man in
each mouth
you will find the other rock lie lower but thei ar so close
togeth that there is not more than a bowshot between them a larg
fig tree in full leaf101 grow upon it and under it li the suck
whirlpool of charybdi three time in the dai doe she vomit forth her
water and three time she suck them down again see that you be not
there when she is suck for if you ar neptun himself could not
save you you must hug the scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you
can for you had better lose six men than your whole crew
is there no wai said i of escap charybdi and at the same
time keep scylla off when she is try to harm my men
you dare devil repli the goddess you ar alwai want to
fight somebodi or someth you will not let yourself be beaten even
by the immort for scylla is not mortal moreov she is savag
extrem rude cruel and invinc there is no help for it your best
chanc will be to get by her as fast as ever you can for if you dawdl
about her rock while you ar put on your armour she mai catch you
with a second cast of her six head and snap up anoth half dozen of
your men so drive your ship past her at full speed and roar out
lustili to crataii who is scylla dam bad luck to her she will then
stop her from make a second raid upon you
you will now come to the thrinacian island and here you will see
mani herd of cattl and flock of sheep belong to the sungodseven
herd of cattl and seven flock of sheep with fifti head in each
flock thei do not breed nor do thei becom fewer in number and thei
ar tend by the goddess phaethusa and lampeti who ar children of
the sungod hyperion by neaera their mother when she had born them
and had done suckl them sent them to the thrinacian island which
wa a long wai off to live there and look after their father flock
and herd if you leav these flock unharm and think of noth but
get home you mai yet after much hardship reach ithaca but if you
harm them then i forewarn you of the destruct both of your ship and
of your comrad and even though you mai yourself escap you will
return late in bad plight after lose all your men
here she end and dawn enthron in gold began to show in heaven
whereon she return inland i then went on board and told my men to
loos the ship from her moor so thei at onc got into her took
their place and began to smite the grei sea with their oar
present the great and cun goddess circ befriend us with a fair
wind that blew dead aft and staid steadili with us keep our sail
well fill so we did whatev want do to the ship gear and
let her go as wind and helmsman head her
then be much troubl in mind i said to my men my friend it
is not right that on or two of us alon should know the propheci
that circ ha made me i will therefor tell you about them so that
whether we live or die we mai do so with our ey open first she said
we were to keep clear of the siren who sit and sing most beautifulli
in a field of flower but she said i might hear them myself so long as
no on els did therefor take me and bind me to the crosspiec half
wai up the mast bind me as i stand upright with a bond so fast that i
cannot possibl break awai and lash the rope end to the mast
itself if i beg and prai you to set me free then bind me more tightli
still
i had hardli finish tell everyth to the men befor we reach
the island of the two sirens102 for the wind had been veri favour
then all of a sudden it fell dead calm there wa not a breath of wind
nor a rippl upon the water so the men furl the sail and stow
them then take to their oar thei whiten the water with the foam
thei rais in row meanwhil i look a larg wheel of wax and cut it
up small with my sword then i knead the wax in my strong hand till
it becam soft which it soon did between the knead and the rai of
the sungod son of hyperion then i stop the ear of all my men and
thei bound me hand and feet to the mast as i stood upright on the
cross piec but thei went on row themselv when we had got within
earshot of the land and the ship wa go at a good rate the siren
saw that we were get in shore and began with their sing
come here thei sang renown ulyss honour to the achaean name
and listen to our two voic no on ever sail past us without
stai to hear the enchant sweet of our songand he who listen
will go on hi wai not onli charm but wiser for we know all the
ill that the god laid upon the argiv and trojan befor troi and
can tell you everyth that is go to happen over the whole world
thei sang these word most music and as i long to hear them
further i made sign by frown to my men that thei should set me
free but thei quicken their stroke and eurylochu and perimed
bound me with still stronger bond till we had got out of hear of
the siren voic then my men took the wax from their ear and
unbound me
immedi after we had got past the island i saw a great wave from
which sprai wa rise and i heard a loud roar sound the men were
so frighten that thei loos hold of their oar for the whole sea
resound with the rush of the waters103 but the ship stai where
it wa for the men had left off row i went round therefor and
exhort them man by man not to lose heart
my friend said i thi is not the first time that we have been in
danger and we ar in noth like so bad a case as when the cyclop
shut us up in hi cave nevertheless my courag and wise counsel save
us then and we shall live to look back on all thi as well now
therefor let us all do as i sai trust in jove and row on with might
and main as for you coxswain these ar your order attend to them
for the ship is in your hand turn her head awai from these steam
rapid and hug the rock or she will give you the slip and be over
yonder befor you know where you ar and you will be the death of us
so thei did as i told them but i said noth about the aw monster
scylla for i knew the men would not go on row if i did but would
huddl togeth in the hold in on thing onli did i disobei circ
strict instructionsi put on my armour then seiz two strong spear
i took my stand on the ship bow for it wa there that i expect
first to see the monster of the rock who wa to do my men so much
harm but i could not make her out anywher though i strain my ey
with look the gloomi rock all over and over
then we enter the strait in great fear of mind for on the on hand
wa scylla and on the other dread charybdi kept suck up the salt
water as she vomit it up it wa like the water in a cauldron when
it is boil over upon a great fire and the sprai reach the top of
the rock on either side when she began to suck again we could see
the water all insid whirl round and round and it made a deafen
sound as it broke against the rock we could see the bottom of the
whirlpool all black with sand and mud and the men were at their wit
end for fear while we were taken up with thi and were expect
each moment to be our last scylla pounc down suddenli upon us and
snatch up my six best men i wa look at onc after both ship and
men and in a moment i saw their hand and feet ever so high abov me
struggl in the air as scylla wa carri them off and i heard them
call out my name in on last despair cry as a fisherman seat
spear in hand upon some jut rock104 throw bait into the water to
deceiv the poor littl fish and spear them with the ox horn with
which hi spear is shod throw them gasp on to the land as he
catch them on by oneeven so did scylla land these pant creatur
on her rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den while thei
scream and stretch out their hand to me in their mortal agoni
thi wa the most sicken sight that i saw throughout all my voyag
when we had pass the wander rock with scylla and terribl
charybdi we reach the nobl island of the sungod where were the
goodli cattl and sheep belong to the sun hyperion while still at
sea in my ship i could bear the cattl low as thei came home to the
yard and the sheep bleat then i rememb what the blind theban
prophet teiresia had told me and how carefulli aeaean circ had
warn me to shun the island of the bless sungod so be much
troubl i said to the men my men i know you ar hard press but
listen while i tell you the propheci that teiresia made me and how
carefulli aeaean circ warn me to shun the island of the bless
sungod for it wa here she said that our worst danger would lie
head the ship therefor awai from the island
the men were in despair at thi and eurylochu at onc gave me an
insol answer ulyss said he you ar cruel you ar veri
strong yourself and never get worn out you seem to be made of iron
and now though your men ar exhaust with toil and want of sleep you
will not let them land and cook themselv a good supper upon thi
island but bid them put out to sea and go fare fruitlessli on
through the watch of the fly night it is by night that the wind
blow hardest and do so much damag how can we escap should on of
those sudden squall spring up from south west or west which so often
wreck a vessel when our lord the god ar unpropiti now
therefor let us obei the behest of night and prepar our supper here
hard by the ship tomorrow morn we will go on board again and put
out to sea
thu spoke eurylochu and the men approv hi word i saw that
heaven meant us a mischief and said you forc me to yield for you
ar mani against on but at ani rate each on of you must take hi
solemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattl or a larg flock of
sheep he will not be so mad as to kill a singl head of either but
will be satisfi with the food that circ ha given us
thei all swore as i bade them and when thei had complet their oath
we made the ship fast in a harbour that wa near a stream of fresh
water and the men went ashor and cook their supper as soon as
thei had had enough to eat and drink thei began talk about their
poor comrad whom scylla had snatch up and eaten thi set them
weep and thei went on cry till thei fell off into a sound sleep
in the third watch of the night when the star had shift their
place jove rais a great gale of wind that flew a hurrican so that
land and sea were cover with thick cloud and night sprang forth out
of the heaven when the child of morn rosyfing dawn
appear we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein
the seanymph hold their court and danc and i call the men
togeth in council
my friend said i we have meat and drink in the ship let us
mind therefor and not touch the cattl or we shall suffer for it
for these cattl and sheep belong to the mighti sun who see and give
ear to everyth and again thei promis that thei would obei
for a whole month the wind blew steadili from the south and there wa
no other wind but onli south and east105 as long as corn and wine
held out the men did not touch the cattl when thei were hungri when
howev thei had eaten all there wa in the ship thei were forc to
go further afield with hook and line catch bird and take
whatev thei could lai their hand on for thei were starv on
dai therefor i went up inland that i might prai heaven to show me
some mean of get awai when i had gone far enough to be clear of
all my men and had found a place that wa well shelter from the
wind i wash my hand and prai to all the god in olympu till by
and by thei sent me off into a sweet sleep
meanwhil eurylochu had been give evil counsel to the men listen
to me said he my poor comrad all death ar bad enough but there
is none so bad as famin why should not we drive in the best of these
cow and offer them in sacrific to the immort god if we ever get
back to ithaca we can build a fine templ to the sungod and enrich it
with everi kind of ornament if howev he is determin to sink our
ship out of reveng for these horn cattl and the other god ar of
the same mind i for on would rather drink salt water onc for all and
have done with it than be starv to death by inch in such a desert
island as thi is
thu spoke eurylochu and the men approv hi word now the cattl
so fair and goodli were feed not far from the ship the men
therefor drove in the best of them and thei all stood round them
sai their prayer and us young oakshoot instead of
barleym for there wa no barlei left when thei had done prai
thei kill the cow and dress their carcass thei cut out the
thigh bone wrap them round in two layer of fat and set some
piec of raw meat on top of them thei had no wine with which to make
drinkoff over the sacrific while it wa cook so thei kept
pour on a littl water from time to time while the inward meat were
be grill then when the thigh bone were burn and thei had
tast the inward meat thei cut the rest up small and put the piec
upon the spit
by thi time my deep sleep had left me and i turn back to the ship
and to the sea shore as i drew near i began to smell hot roast meat
so i groan out a prayer to the immort god father jove i
exclaim and all you other god who live in everlast bliss you
have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have sent me
see what fine work these men of mine have been make in my absenc
meanwhil lampeti went straight off to the sun and told him we had
been kill hi cow whereon he flew into a great rage and said to
the immort father jove and all you other god who live in
everlast bliss i must have vengeanc on the crew of ulyss ship
thei have had the insol to kill my cow which were the on thing i
love to look upon whether i wa go up heaven or down again if
thei do not squar account with me about my cow i will go down to
hade and shine there among the dead
sun said jove go on shine upon us god and upon mankind over
the fruit earth i will shiver their ship into littl piec with a
bolt of white lightn as soon as thei get out to sea
i wa told all thi by calypso who said she had heard it from the
mouth of mercuri
as soon as i got down to my ship and to the sea shore i rebuk each
on of the men separ but we could see no wai out of it for the
cow were dead alreadi and inde the god began at onc to show sign
and wonder among us for the hide of the cattl crawl about and
the joint upon the spit began to low like cow and the meat whether
cook or raw kept on make a nois just as cow do
for six dai my men kept drive in the best cow and feast upon
them but when jove the son of saturn had ad a seventh dai the furi
of the gale abat we therefor went on board rais our mast
spread sail and put out to sea as soon as we were well awai from the
island and could see noth but sky and sea the son of saturn rais
a black cloud over our ship and the sea grew dark beneath it we did
not get on much further for in anoth moment we were caught by a
terrif squall from the west that snap the forestai of the mast so
that it fell aft while all the ship gear tumbl about at the bottom
of the vessel the mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the
ship stern so that the bone of hi head were crush to piec and
he fell overboard as though he were dive with no more life left in
him
then jove let fly with hi thunderbolt and the ship went round and
round and wa fill with fire and brimston as the lightn struck
it the men all fell into the sea thei were carri about in the water
round the ship look like so mani seagul but the god present
depriv them of all chanc of get home again
i stuck to the ship till the sea knock her side from her keel
which drift about by itself and struck the mast out of her in the
direct of the keel but there wa a backstai of stout oxthong still
hang about it and with thi i lash the mast and keel togeth
and get astrid of them wa carri wherev the wind chose to
take me
the gale from the west had now spent it forc and the wind got into
the south again which frighten me lest i should be taken back to the
terribl whirlpool of charybdi thi inde wa what actual
happen for i wa born along by the wave all night and by sunris
had reach the rock of scylla and the whirlpool she wa then suck
down the salt sea water106 but i wa carri aloft toward the fig
tree which i caught hold of and clung on to like a bat i could not
plant my feet anywher so as to stand secur for the root were a
long wai off and the bough that overshadow the whole pool were too
high too vast and too far apart for me to reach them so i hung
patient on wait till the pool should discharg my mast and raft
againand a veri long while it seem a juryman is not more glad to
get home to supper after have been long detain in court by
troublesom case than i wa to see my raft begin to work it wai
out of the whirlpool again at last i let go with my hand and feet
and fell heavili into the sea hard by my raft on to which i then got
and began to row with my hand as for scylla the father of god and
men would not let her get further sight of meotherwis i should have
certainli been lost107
henc i wa carri along for nine dai till on the tenth night the
god strand me on the ogygian island where dwell the great and
power goddess calypso she took me in and wa kind to me but i need
sai no more about thi for i told you and your nobl wife all about it
yesterdai and i hate sai the same thing over and over again

death the common lot of mankind lai their hand upon you i now take
my leav be happi in thi hous with your children your peopl and
with king alcin
as he spoke he cross the threshold and alcin sent a man to
conduct him to hi ship and to the sea shore aret also sent some
maidserv with himon with a clean shirt and cloak anoth to
carri hi strong box and a third with corn and wine when thei got to
the water side the crew took these thing and put them on board with
all the meat and drink but for ulyss thei spread a rug and a linen
sheet on deck that he might sleep soundli in the stern of the ship
then he too went on board and lai down without a word but the crew
took everi man hi place and loos the hawser from the pierc stone
to which it had been bound thereon when thei began row out to sea
ulyss fell into a deep sweet and almost deathlik slumber111
the ship bound forward on her wai as a four in hand chariot fli
over the cours when the hors feel the whip her prow curvet as it
were the neck of a stallion and a great wave of dark blue water
seeth in her wake she held steadili on her cours and even a
falcon swiftest of all bird could not have kept pace with her thu
then she cut her wai through the water carri on who wa as
cun as the god but who wa now sleep peacefulli forget of
all that he had suffer both on the field of battl and by the wave
of the weari sea
when the bright star that herald the approach of dawn began to show
the ship drew near to land112 now there is in ithaca a haven of the
old merman phorci which li between two point that break the line
of the sea and shut the harbour in these shelter it from the storm of
wind and sea that rage outsid so that when onc within it a ship
mai lie without be even moor at the head of thi harbour there is
a larg oliv tree and at no great distanc a fine overarch cavern
sacr to the nymph who ar call naiads113 there ar mix bowl
within it and winejar of stone and the bee hive there moreov
there ar great loom of stone on which the nymph weav their robe of
sea purpleveri curiou to seeand at all time there is water within
it it ha two entranc on face north by which mortal can go down
into the cave while the other come from the south and is more
mysteri mortal cannot possibl get in by it it is the wai taken
by the god
into thi harbour then thei took their ship for thei knew the
place114 she had so much wai upon her that she ran half her own length
on to the shore115 when howev thei had land the first thing
thei did wa to lift ulyss with hi rug and linen sheet out of the
ship and lai him down upon the sand still fast asleep then thei took
out the present which minerva had persuad the phaeacian to give him
when he wa set out on hi voyag homeward thei put these all
togeth by the root of the oliv tree awai from the road for fear
some passer by116 might come and steal them befor ulyss awok and
then thei made the best of their wai home again
but neptun did not forget the threat with which he had alreadi
threaten ulyss so he took counsel with jove father jove said
he i shall no longer be held in ani sort of respect among you god
if mortal like the phaeacian who ar my own flesh and blood show
such small regard for me i said i would let ulyss get home when he
had suffer suffici i did not sai that he should never get home
at all for i knew you had alreadi nod your head about it and
promis that he should do so but now thei have brought him in a ship
fast asleep and have land him in ithaca after load him with more
magnific present of bronz gold and raiment than he would ever
have brought back from troi if he had had hi share of the spoil and
got home without misadventur
and jove answer what o lord of the earthquak ar you talk
about the god ar by no mean want in respect for you it would be
monstrou were thei to insult on so old and honour as you ar as
regard mortal howev if ani of them is indulg in insol and
treat you disrespectfulli it will alwai rest with yourself to deal
with him as you mai think proper so do just as you pleas
i should have done so at onc repli neptun if i were not
anxiou to avoid anyth that might displeas you now therefor i
should like to wreck the phaeacian ship as it is return from it
escort thi will stop them from escort peopl in futur and i
should also like to buri their citi under a huge mountain
my good friend answer jove i should recommend you at the veri
moment when the peopl from the citi ar watch the ship on her wai
to turn it into a rock near the land and look like a ship thi will
astonish everybodi and you can then buri their citi under the
mountain
when earthencircl neptun heard thi he went to scheria where the
phaeacian live and stai there till the ship which wa make rapid
wai had got close in then he went up to it turn it into stone and
drove it down with the flat of hi hand so as to root it in the ground
after thi he went awai
the phaeacian then began talk among themselv and on would turn
toward hi neighbour sai bless my heart who is it that can have
root the ship in the sea just as she wa get into port we could
see the whole of her onli a moment ago
thi wa how thei talk but thei knew noth about it and alcin
said i rememb now the old propheci of my father he said that
neptun would be angri with us for take everi on so safe over the
sea and would on dai wreck a phaeacian ship as it wa return from
an escort and buri our citi under a high mountain thi wa what my
old father us to sai and now it is all come true117 now therefor
let us all do as i sai in the first place we must leav off give
peopl escort when thei come here and in the next let us sacrific
twelv pick bull to neptun that he mai have merci upon us and not
buri our citi under the high mountain when the peopl heard thi thei
were afraid and got readi the bull
thu did the chief and ruler of the phaeacian prai to king neptun
stand round hi altar and at the same time118 ulyss woke up onc
more upon hi own soil he had been so long awai that he did not know
it again moreov jove daughter minerva had made it a foggi dai so
that peopl might not know of hi have come and that she might tell
him everyth without either hi wife or hi fellow citizen and
friend recognis him119 until he had taken hi reveng upon the
wick suitor everyth therefor seem quit differ to
himth long straight track the harbour the precipic and the
goodli tree appear all chang as he start up and look upon hi
nativ land so he smote hi thigh with the flat of hi hand and
cri aloud despairingli
ala he exclaim among what manner of peopl am i fallen ar
thei savag and uncivilis or hospit and human where shall i put
all thi treasur and which wai shall i go i wish i had staid over
there with the phaeacian or i could have gone to some other great
chief who would have been good to me and given me an escort as it is i
do not know where to put my treasur and i cannot leav it here for
fear somebodi els should get hold of it in good truth the chief and
ruler of the phaeacian have not been deal fairli by me and have
left me in the wrong countri thei said thei would take me back to
ithaca and thei have not done so mai jove the protector of suppliant
chastis them for he watch over everybodi and punish those who do
wrong still i suppos i must count my good and see if the crew have
gone off with ani of them
he count hi goodli copper and cauldron hi gold and all hi
cloth but there wa noth miss still he kept griev about
not be in hi own countri and wander up and down by the shore of
the sound sea bewail hi hard fate then minerva came up to him
disguis as a young shepherd of delic and princ mien with a
good cloak fold doubl about her shoulder she had sandal on her
come feet and held a javelin in her hand ulyss wa glad when he
saw her and went straight up to her
my friend said he you ar the first person whom i have met with in
thi countri i salut you therefor and beg you to be well dispos
toward me protect these my good and myself too for i embrac your
knee and prai to you as though you were a god tell me then and tell
me truli what land and countri is thi who ar it inhabit am i
on an island or is thi the sea board of some contin
minerva answer stranger you must be veri simpl or must have come
from somewher a long wai off not to know what countri thi is it is
a veri celebr place and everybodi know it east and west it is
rug and not a good drive countri but it is by no mean a bad
island for what there is of it it grow ani quantiti of corn and also
wine for it is water both by rain and dew it breed cattl also and
goat all kind of timber grow here and there ar water place
where the water never run dry so sir the name of ithaca is known
even as far as troi which i understand to be a long wai off from thi
achaean countri
ulyss wa glad at find himself as minerva told him in hi own
countri and he began to answer but he did not speak the truth and
made up a ly stori in the instinct wili of hi heart
i heard of ithaca said he when i wa in crete beyond the sea and
now it seem i have reach it with all these treasur i have left as
much more behind me for my children but am fly becaus i kill
orsilochu son of idomeneu the fleetest runner in crete i kill him
becaus he want to rob me of the spoil i had got from troi with so
much troubl and danger both on the field of battl and by the wave of
the weari sea he said i had not serv hi father loyal at troi as
vassal but had set myself up as an independ ruler so i lai in wait
for him with on of my follow by the road side and spear him as
he wa come into town from the countri it wa a veri dark night and
nobodi saw us it wa not known therefor that i had kill him but
as soon as i had done so i went to a ship and besought the owner who
were phoenician to take me on board and set me in pylo or in eli
where the epean rule give them as much spoil as satisfi them
thei meant no guil but the wind drove them off their cours and we
sail on till we came hither by night it wa all we could do to get
insid the harbour and none of us said a word about supper though we
want it badli but we all went on shore and lai down just as we were
i wa veri tire and fell asleep directli so thei took my good out of
the ship and place them besid me where i wa ly upon the sand
then thei sail awai to sidonia and i wa left here in great distress
of mind
such wa hi stori but minerva smile and caress him with her hand
then she took the form of a woman fair state and wise he must be
inde a shifti ly fellow said she who could surpass you in all
manner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist dare
devil that you ar full of guil unweari in deceit can you not
drop your trick and your instinct falsehood even now that you ar
in your own countri again we will sai no more howev about thi
for we can both of us deceiv upon occasiony ar the most
accomplish counsellor and orat among all mankind while i for
diplomaci and subtleti have no equal among the god did you not know
jove daughter minervam who have been ever with you who kept watch
over you in all your troubl and who made the phaeacian take so
great a like to you and now again i am come here to talk thing
over with you and help you to hide the treasur i made the phaeacian
give you i want to tell you about the troubl that await you in your
own hous you have got to face them but tell no on neither man nor
woman that you have come home again bear everyth and put up with
everi man insol without a word
and ulyss answer a man goddess mai know a great deal but you
ar so constantli chang your appear that when he meet you it is
a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not thi much
howev i know exceedingli well you were veri kind to me as long as
we achaean were fight befor troi but from the dai on which we
went on board ship after have sack the citi of priam and heaven
dispers usfrom that dai minerva i saw no more of you and cannot
ever rememb your come to my ship to help me in a difficulti i had
to wander on sick and sorri till the god deliv me from evil and i
reach the citi of the phaeacian where you encourag me and took me
into the town120 and now i beseech you in your father name tell me
the truth for i do not believ i am realli back in ithaca i am in
some other countri and you ar mock me and deceiv me in all you
have been sai tell me then truli have i realli got back to my own
countri
you ar alwai take someth of that sort in your head repli
minerva and that is why i cannot desert you in your afflict you
ar so plausibl shrewd and shifti ani on but yourself on return
from so long a voyag would at onc have gone home to see hi wife and
children but you do not seem to care about ask after them or
hear ani new about them till you have exploit your wife who
remain at home vainli griev for you and have no peac night or
dai for the tear she shed on your behalf as for my not come near
you i wa never uneasi about you for i wa certain you would get back
safe though you would lose all your men and i did not wish to
quarrel with my uncl neptun who never forgav you for have blind
hi son121 i will now howev point out to you the lie of the land
and you will then perhap believ me thi is the haven of the old
merman phorci and here is the oliv tree that grow at the head of
it near it is the cave sacr to the naiads122 here too is the
overarch cavern in which you have offer mani an accept
hecatomb to the nymph and thi is the wood mountain neritum
as she spoke the goddess dispers the mist and the land appear then
ulyss rejoic at find himself again in hi own land and kiss
the bounteou soil he lift up hi hand and prai to the nymph
sai naiad nymph daughter of jove i made sure that i wa never
again to see you now therefor i greet you with all love
salut and i will bring you offer as in the old dai if
jove redoubt daughter will grant me life and bring my son to
manhood
take heart and do not troubl yourself about that rejoin minerva
let us rather set about stow your thing at onc in the cave where
thei will be quit safe let us see how we can best manag it all
therewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hide
place while ulyss brought up all the treasur of gold bronz and
good cloth which the phaeacian had given him thei stow
everyth carefulli awai and minerva set a stone against the door of
the cave then the two sat down by the root of the great oliv and
consult how to compass the destruct of the wick suitor
ulyss said minerva nobl son of laert think how you can lai
hand on these disreput peopl who have been lord it in your
hous these three year court your wife and make wed present
to her while she doe noth but lament your absenc give hope and
send encourag messages123 to everi on of them but mean the
veri opposit of all she sai
and ulyss answer in good truth goddess it seem i should have
come to much the same bad end in my own hous as agamemnon did if you
had not given me such time inform advis me how i shall best
aveng myself stand by my side and put your courag into my heart as
on the dai when we loos troi fair diadem from her brow help me now
as you did then and i will fight three hundr men if you goddess
will be with me
trust me for that said she i will not lose sight of you when onc
we set about it and i imagin that some of those who ar devour
your substanc will then bespatt the pavement with their blood and
brain i will begin by disguis you so that no human be shall
know you i will cover your bodi with wrinkl you shall lose all your
yellow hair i will cloth you in a garment that shall fill all who see
it with loath i will blear your fine ey for you and make you an
unseemli object in the sight of the suitor of your wife and of the
son whom you left behind you then go at onc to the swineherd who is
in charg of your pig he ha been alwai well affect toward you
and is devot to penelop and your son you will find him feed hi
pig near the rock that is call raven124 by the fountain arethusa
where thei ar fatten on beechmast and spring water after their
manner stai with him and find out how thing ar go while i
proce to sparta and see your son who is with menelau at lacedaemon
where he ha gone to try and find out whether you ar still alive125
but why said ulyss did you not tell him for you knew all about
it did you want him too to go sail about amid all kind of hardship
while other ar eat up hi estat
minerva answer never mind about him i sent him that he might be
well spoken of for have gone he is in no sort of difficulti but is
stai quit comfort with menelau and is surround with
abund of everi kind the suitor have put out to sea and ar ly
in wait for him for thei mean to kill him befor he can get home i do
not much think thei will succe but rather that some of those who ar
now eat up your estat will first find a grave themselv
as she spoke minerva touch him with her wand and cover him with
wrinkl took awai all hi yellow hair and wither the flesh over
hi whole bodi she blear hi ey which were natur veri fine
on she chang hi cloth and threw an old rag of a wrap about him
and a tunic tatter filthi and begrim with smoke she also gave
him an undress deer skin as an outer garment and furnish him with
a staff and a wallet all in hole with a twist thong for him to
sling it over hi shoulder
when the pair had thu laid their plan thei part and the goddess
went straight to lacedaemon to fetch telemachu
book xiv
ulyss in the hut with eumaeu
ulyss now left the haven and took the rough track up through the
wood countri and over the crest of the mountain till he reach the
place where minerva had said that he would find the swineherd who wa
the most thrifti servant he had he found him sit in front of hi
hut which wa by the yard that he had built on a site which could be
seen from far he had made them spacious126 and fair to see with a
free run for the pig all round them he had built them dure hi
master absenc of stone which he had gather out of the ground
without sai anyth to penelop or laert and he had fenc them
on top with thorn bush outsid the yard he had run a strong fenc of
oaken post split and set pretti close togeth while insid he had
built twelv stye near on anoth for the sow to lie in there were
fifti pig wallow in each stye all of them breed sow but the
boar slept outsid and were much fewer in number for the suitor kept
on eat them and the swineherd had to send them the best he had
continu there were three hundr and sixti boar pig and the
herdsman four hound which were as fierc as wolv slept alwai
with them the swineherd wa at that moment cut out a pair of
sandals127 from a good stout ox hide three of hi men were out herd
the pig in on place or anoth and he had sent the fourth to town
with a boar that he had been forc to send the suitor that thei might
sacrific it and have their fill of meat
when the hound saw ulyss thei set up a furiou bark and flew at
him but ulyss wa cun enough to sit down and loos hi hold of
the stick that he had in hi hand still he would have been torn by
them in hi own homestead had not the swineherd drop hi ox hide
rush full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dog off
by shout and throw stone at them then he said to ulyss old
man the dog were like to have made short work of you and then you
would have got me into troubl the god have given me quit enough
worri without that for i have lost the best of master and am in
continu grief on hi account i have to attend swine for other peopl
to eat while he if he yet live to see the light of dai is starv
in some distant land but come insid and when you have had your fill
of bread and wine tell me where you come from and all about your
misfortun
on thi the swineherd led the wai into the hut and bade him sit down
he strew a good thick bed of rush upon the floor and on the top of
thi he threw the shaggi chamoi skina great thick oneon which he
us to sleep by night ulyss wa pleas at be made thu welcom
and said mai jove sir and the rest of the god grant you your
heart desir in return for the kind wai in which you have receiv
me
to thi you answer o swineherd eumaeu stranger though a still
poorer man should come here it would not be right for me to insult
him for all stranger and beggar ar from jove you must take what
you can get and be thank for servant live in fear when thei have
young lord for their master and thi is my misfortun now for
heaven ha hinder the return of him who would have been alwai good
to me and given me someth of my owna hous a piec of land a good
look wife and all els that a liber master allow a servant who
ha work hard for him and whose labour the god have prosper as
thei have mine in the situat which i hold if my master had grown
old here he would have done great thing by me but he is gone and i
wish that helen whole race were utterli destroi for she ha been
the death of mani a good man it wa thi matter that took my master to
iliu the land of nobl steed to fight the trojan in the caus of
king agamemnon
as he spoke he bound hi girdl round him and went to the stye where
the young suck pig were pen he pick out two which he brought
back with him and sacrif he sing them cut them up and spit
them when the meat wa cook he brought it all in and set it befor
ulyss hot and still on the spit whereon ulyss sprinkl it over
with white barlei meal the swineherd then mix wine in a bowl of
ivywood and take a seat opposit ulyss told him to begin
fall to stranger said he on a dish of servant pork the fat
pig have to go to the suitor who eat them up without shame or
scrupl but the bless god love not such shame do and
respect those who do what is law and right even the fierc
freeboot who go raid on other peopl land and jove give them
their spoileven thei when thei have fill their ship and got home
again live consciencestricken and look fearfulli for judgement but
some god seem to have told these peopl that ulyss is dead and gone
thei will not therefor go back to their own home and make their
offer of marriag in the usual wai but wast hi estat by forc
without fear or stint not a dai or night come out of heaven but thei
sacrific not on victim nor two onli and thei take the run of hi
wine for he wa exceedingli rich no other great man either in ithaca
or on the mainland is as rich as he wa he had as much as twenti men
put togeth i will tell you what he had there ar twelv herd of
cattl upon the main land and as mani flock of sheep there ar also
twelv drove of pig while hi own men and hire stranger feed him
twelv wide spread herd of goat here in ithaca he run even
larg flock of goat on the far end of the island and thei ar in the
charg of excel goat herd each on of these send the suitor the
best goat in the flock everi dai as for myself i am in charg of the
pig that you see here and i have to keep pick out the best i have
and send it to them
thi wa hi stori but ulyss went on eat and drink raven
without a word brood hi reveng when he had eaten enough and wa
satisfi the swineherd took the bowl from which he usual drank
fill it with wine and gave it to ulyss who wa pleas and said
as he took it in hi hand my friend who wa thi master of your
that bought you and paid for you so rich and so power as you tell
me you sai he perish in the caus of king agamemnon tell me who he
wa in case i mai have met with such a person jove and the other god
know but i mai be abl to give you new of him for i have travel
much
eumaeu answer old man no travel who come here with new will
get ulyss wife and son to believ hi stori nevertheless tramp in
want of a lodg keep come with their mouth full of li and not a
word of truth everi on who find hi wai to ithaca goe to my
mistress and tell her falsehood whereon she take them in make
much of them and ask them all manner of question cry all the
time as women will when thei have lost their husband and you too old
man for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up a veri pretti
stori but the wolv and bird of prei have long sinc torn ulyss to
piec or the fish of the sea have eaten him and hi bone ar
ly buri deep in sand upon some foreign shore he is dead and gone
and a bad busi it is for all hi friendsfor me especi go
where i mai i shall never find so good a master not even if i were to
go home to my mother and father where i wa bred and born i do not so
much care howev about my parent now though i should dearli like
to see them again in my own countri it is the loss of ulyss that
griev me most i cannot speak of him without rever though he is
here no longer for he wa veri fond of me and took such care of me
that wherev he mai be i shall alwai honour hi memori
my friend repli ulyss you ar veri posit and veri hard of
belief about your master come home again nevertheless i will not
mere sai but will swear that he is come do not give me anyth
for my new till he ha actual come you mai then give me a shirt and
cloak of good wear if you will i am in great want but i will not take
anyth at all till then for i hate a man even as i hate hell fire
who let hi poverti tempt him into ly i swear by king jove by the
rite of hospit and by that hearth of ulyss to which i have now
come that all will sure happen as i have said it will ulyss will
return in thi self same year with the end of thi moon and the
begin of the next he will be here to do vengeanc on all those who
ar ill treat hi wife and son
to thi you answer o swineherd eumaeu old man you will neither
get paid for bring good new nor will ulyss ever come home drink
your wine in peac and let us talk about someth els do not keep
on remind me of all thi it alwai pain me when ani on speak
about my honour master as for your oath we will let it alon but i
onli wish he mai come as do penelop hi old father laert and hi
son telemachu i am terribl unhappi too about thi same boi of hi
he wa run up fast into manhood and bade fare to be no wors man
face and figur than hi father but some on either god or man ha
been unsettl hi mind so he ha gone off to pylo to try and get
new of hi father and the suitor ar ly in wait for him as he is
come home in the hope of leav the hous of arceisiu without a
name in ithaca but let us sai no more about him and leav him to be
taken or els to escap if the son of saturn hold hi hand over him
to protect him and now old man tell me your own stori tell me also
for i want to know who you ar and where you come from tell me of
your town and parent what manner of ship you came in how crew
brought you to ithaca and from what countri thei profess to comefor
you cannot have come by land
and ulyss answer i will tell you all about it if there were meat
and wine enough and we could stai here in the hut with noth to do
but to eat and drink while the other go to their work i could easili
talk on for a whole twelv month without ever finish the stori of
the sorrow with which it ha pleas heaven to visit me
i am by birth a cretan my father wa a well to do man who had mani
son born in marriag wherea i wa the son of a slave whom he had
purchas for a concubin nevertheless my father castor son of hylax
whose lineag i claim and who wa held in the highest honour among
the cretan for hi wealth prosper and the valour of hi son put
me on the same level with my brother who had been born in wedlock
when howev death took him to the hous of hade hi son divid
hi estat and cast lot for their share but to me thei gave a
hold and littl els nevertheless my valour enabl me to marri
into a rich famili for i wa not given to brag or shirk on the
field of battl it is all over now still if you look at the straw
you can see what the ear wa for i have had troubl enough and to
spare mar and minerva made me doughti in war when i had pick my
men to surpris the enemi with an ambuscad i never gave death so much
as a thought but wa the first to leap forward and spear all whom i
could overtak such wa i in battl but i did not care about farm
work nor the frugal home life of those who would bring up children my
delight wa in ship fight javelin and arrowsth that most
men shudder to think of but on man like on thing and anoth
anoth and thi wa what i wa most natur inclin to befor the
achaean went to troi nine time wa i in command of men and ship on
foreign servic and i amass much wealth i had my pick of the spoil
in the first instanc and much more wa allot to me later on
my hous grew apac and i becam a great man among the cretan but
when jove counsel that terribl expedit in which so mani
perish the peopl requir me and idomeneu to lead their ship to
troi and there wa no wai out of it for thei insist on our do
so there we fought for nine whole year but in the tenth we sack
the citi of priam and sail home again as heaven dispers us then it
wa that jove devis evil against me i spent but on month happili
with my children wife and properti and then i conceiv the idea of
make a descent on egypt so i fit out a fine fleet and man it
i had nine ship and the peopl flock to fill them for six dai i
and my men made feast and i found them mani victim both for sacrific
to the god and for themselv but on the seventh dai we went on board
and set sail from crete with a fair north wind behind us though we were
go down a river noth went ill with ani of our ship and we had
no sick on board but sat where we were and let the ship go as the
wind and steersmen took them on the fifth dai we reach the river
aegyptu there i station my ship in the river bid my men stai
by them and keep guard over them while i sent out scout to reconnoitr
from everi point of vantag
but the men disobei my order took to their own devic and
ravag the land of the egyptian kill the men and take their
wive and children captiv the alarm wa soon carri to the citi and
when thei heard the war cry the peopl came out at daybreak till the
plain wa fill with horsemen and foot soldier and with the gleam of
armour then jove spread panic among my men and thei would no longer
face the enemi for thei found themselv surround the egyptian
kill mani of us and took the rest aliv to do forc labour for
them jove howev put it in my mind to do thusand i wish i had di
then and there in egypt instead for there wa much sorrow in store for
mei took off my helmet and shield and drop my spear from my hand
then i went straight up to the king chariot clasp hi knee and
kiss them whereon he spare my life bade me get into hi chariot
and took me weep to hi own home mani made at me with their ashen
spear and tri to kill me in their furi but the king protect me
for he fear the wrath of jove the protector of stranger who
punish those who do evil
i stai there for seven year and got togeth much monei among the
egyptian for thei all gave me someth but when it wa now go on
for eight year there came a certain phoenician a cun rascal who
had alreadi commit all sort of villaini and thi man talk me
over into go with him to phoenicia where hi hous and hi
possess lai i stai there for a whole twelv month but at the
end of that time when month and dai had gone by till the same season
had come round again he set me on board a ship bound for libya on a
pretenc that i wa to take a cargo along with him to that place but
realli that he might sell me as a slave and take the monei i fetch i
suspect hi intent but went on board with him for i could not
help it
the ship ran befor a fresh north wind till we had reach the sea
that li between crete and libya there howev jove counsel
their destruct for as soon as we were well out from crete and could
see noth but sea and sky he rais a black cloud over our ship and
the sea grew dark beneath it then jove let fly with hi thunderbolt
and the ship went round and round and wa fill with fire and
brimston as the lightn struck it the men fell all into the sea
thei were carri about in the water round the ship look like so
mani seagul but the god present depriv them of all chanc of
get home again i wa all dismai jove howev sent the ship
mast within my reach which save my life for i clung to it and
drift befor the furi of the gale nine dai did i drift but in the
dark of the tenth night a great wave bore me on to the thesprotian
coast there pheidon king of the thesprotian entertain me hospit
without charg me anyth at allfor hi son found me when i wa
nearli dead with cold and fatigu whereon he rais me by the hand
took me to hi father hous and gave me cloth to wear
there it wa that i heard new of ulyss for the king told me he had
entertain him and shown him much hospit while he wa on hi
homeward journei he show me also the treasur of gold and wrought
iron that ulyss had got togeth there wa enough to keep hi famili
for ten gener so much had he left in the hous of king pheidon
but the king said ulyss had gone to dodona that he might learn jove
mind from the god high oak tree and know whether after so long an
absenc he should return to ithaca openli or in secret moreov the
king swore in my presenc make drinkoff in hi own hous as
he did so that the ship wa by the water side and the crew found
that should take him to hi own countri he sent me off howev befor
ulyss return for there happen to be a thesprotian ship sail
for the wheatgrow island of dulichium and he told those in charg
of her to be sure and take me safe to king acastu
these men hatch a plot against me that would have reduc me to the
veri extrem of miseri for when the ship had got some wai out from
land thei resolv on sell me as a slave thei strip me of the
shirt and cloak that i wa wear and gave me instead the tatter
old clout in which you now see me then toward nightfal thei
reach the till land of ithaca and there thei bound me with a
strong rope fast in the ship while thei went on shore to get supper by
the sea side but the god soon undid my bond for me and have drawn
my rag over my head i slid down the rudder into the sea where i
struck out and swam till i wa well clear of them and came ashor near
a thick wood in which i lai conceal thei were veri angri at my
have escap and went search about for me till at last thei
thought it wa no further us and went back to their ship the god
have hidden me thu easili then took me to a good man doorfor it
seem that i am not to die yet awhil
to thi you answer o swineherd eumaeu poor unhappi stranger i
have found the stori of your misfortun extrem interest but
that part about ulyss is not right and you will never get me to
believ it why should a man like you go about tell li in thi
wai i know all about the return of my master the god on and all of
them detest him or thei would have taken him befor troi or let him
die with friend around him when the dai of hi fight were done
for then the achaean would have built a mound over hi ash and hi
son would have been heir to hi renown but now the storm wind have
spirit him awai we know not whither
as for me i live out of the wai here with the pig and never go to
the town unless when penelop send for me on the arriv of some new
about ulyss then thei all sit round and ask question both those
who griev over the king absenc and those who rejoic at it becaus
thei can eat up hi properti without pai for it for my own part i
have never care about ask anyon els sinc the time when i wa
taken in by an aetolian who had kill a man and come a long wai till
at last he reach my station and i wa veri kind to him he said he
had seen ulyss with idomeneu among the cretan refit hi ship
which had been damag in a gale he said ulyss would return in the
follow summer or autumn with hi men and that he would bring back
much wealth and now you you unfortun old man sinc fate ha
brought you to my door do not try to flatter me in thi wai with vain
hope it is not for ani such reason that i shall treat you kindli but
onli out of respect for jove the god of hospit as fear him and
piti you
ulyss answer i see that you ar of an unbeliev mind i have
given you my oath and yet you will not credit me let us then make a
bargain and call all the god in heaven to wit it if your master
come home give me a cloak and shirt of good wear and send me to
dulichium where i want to go but if he doe not come as i sai he will
set your men on to me and tell them to throw me from yonder precipic
as a warn to tramp not to go about the countri tell li
and a pretti figur i should cut then repli eumaeu both now and
hereaft if i were to kill you after receiv you into my hut and
show you hospit i should have to sai my prayer in good
earnest if i did but it is just supper time and i hope my men will
come in directli that we mai cook someth savouri for supper
thu did thei convers and present the swineherd came up with the
pig which were then shut up for the night in their stye and a
tremend squeal thei made as thei were be driven into them but
eumaeu call to hi men and said bring in the best pig you have
that i mai sacrific him for thi stranger and we will take toll of
him ourselv we have had troubl enough thi long time feed pig
while other reap the fruit of our labour
on thi he began chop firewood while the other brought in a fine
fat five year old boar pig and set it at the altar eumaeu did not
forget the god for he wa a man of good principl so the first
thing he did wa to cut bristl from the pig face and throw them
into the fire prai to all the god as he did so that ulyss might
return home again then he club the pig with a billet of oak which
he had kept back when he wa chop the firewood and stun it
while the other slaughter and sing it then thei cut it up and
eumaeu began by put raw piec from each joint on to some of the
fat these he sprinkl with barlei meal and laid upon the ember
thei cut the rest of the meat up small put the piec upon the spit
and roast them till thei were done when thei had taken them off the
spit thei threw them on to the dresser in a heap the swineherd who
wa a most equit man then stood up to give everi on hi share he
made seven portion on of these he set apart for mercuri the son of
maia and the nymph prai to them as he did so the other he dealt
out to the men man by man he gave ulyss some slice cut lengthwai
down the loin as a mark of especi honour and ulyss wa much
pleas i hope eumaeu said he that jove will be as well
dispos toward you as i am for the respect you ar show to an
outcast like myself
to thi you answer o swineherd eumaeu eat my good fellow and
enjoi your supper such as it is god grant thi and withhold that
just as he think right for he can do whatev he choos
as he spoke he cut off the first piec and offer it as a burnt
sacrific to the immort god then he made them a drinkoff put
the cup in the hand of ulyss and sat down to hi own portion
mesauliu brought them their bread the swineherd had brought thi man
on hi own account from among the taphian dure hi master absenc
and had paid for him with hi own monei without sai anyth either
to hi mistress or laert thei then laid their hand upon the good
thing that were befor them and when thei had had enough to eat and
drink mesauliu took awai what wa left of the bread and thei all
went to bed after have made a hearti supper
now the night came on stormi and veri dark for there wa no moon it
pour without ceas and the wind blew strong from the west which
is a wet quarter so ulyss thought he would see whether eumaeu in
the excel care he took of him would take off hi own cloak and
give it him or make on of hi men give him on listen to me said
he eumaeu and the rest of you when i have said a prayer i will tell
you someth it is the wine that make me talk in thi wai wine will
make even a wise man fall to sing it will make him chuckl and
danc and sai mani a word that he had better leav unspoken still as
i have begun i will go on would that i were still young and strong as
when we got up an ambuscad befor troi menelau and ulyss were the
leader but i wa in command also for the other two would have it so
when we had come up to the wall of the citi we crouch down beneath
our armour and lai there under cover of the reed and thick brushwood
that grew about the swamp it came on to freez with a north wind
blow the snow fell small and fine like hoar frost and our shield
were coat thick with rime the other had all got cloak and shirt
and slept comfort enough with their shield about their shoulder
but i had carelessli left my cloak behind me not think that i
should be too cold and had gone off in noth but my shirt and
shield when the night wa twothird through and the star had shift
their place i nudg ulyss who wa close to me with my elbow and
he at onc gave me hi ear
ulyss said i thi cold will be the death of me for i have no
cloak some god fool me into set off with noth on but my
shirt and i do not know what to do
ulyss who wa as crafti as he wa valiant hit upon the follow
plan

then he rais hi head on hi elbow
my friend said he i have had a dream from heaven in my sleep we
ar a long wai from the ship i wish some on would go down and tell
agamemnon to send us up more men at onc
on thi thoa son of andraemon threw off hi cloak and set out run
to the ship whereon i took the cloak and lai in it comfort enough
till morn would that i were still young and strong as i wa in
those dai for then some on of you swineherd would give me a cloak
both out of good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier but
now peopl look down upon me becaus my cloth ar shabbi
and eumaeu answer old man you have told us an excel stori

and then when thei had got freight enough thei sent to tell the
woman their messeng a veri cun fellow came to my father

ulyss is without bed and cover with cobweb
she is still at the hous repli eumaeu griev and break
her heart and do noth but weep both night and dai continu
as he spoke he took telemachu spear whereon he cross the stone
threshold and came insid ulyss rose from hi seat to give him place
as he enter but telemachu check him sit down stranger said
he i can easili find anoth seat and there is on here who will lai

ulyss went back to hi own place and eumaeu strew some green
brushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for
telemachu to sit upon then the swineherd brought them platter of
cold meat the remain from what thei had eaten the dai befor and he
fill the bread basket with bread as fast as he could he mix wine

as thei had had enough to eat and drink telemachu said to eumaeu
old friend where doe thi stranger come from how did hi crew bring
him to ithaca and who were theyfor assuredli he did not come here by
land
to thi you answer o swineherd eumaeu my son i will tell you the
real truth he sai he is a cretan and that he ha been a great
travel at thi moment he is run awai from a thesprotian ship
and ha taken refug at my station so i will put him into your hand
do whatev you like with him onli rememb that he is your
suppliant
i am veri much distress said telemachu by what you have just
told me how can i take thi stranger into my hous i am as yet young
and am not strong enough to hold my own if ani man attack me my
mother cannot make up her mind whether to stai where she is and look
after the hous out of respect for public opinion and the memori of her
husband or whether the time is now come for her to take the best man
of those who ar woo her and the on who will make her the most
advantag offer still as the stranger ha come to your station i
will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear with a sword and sandal
and will send him wherev he want to go or if you like you can keep
him here at the station and i will send him cloth and food that he
mai be no burden on you and on your men but i will not have him go
near the suitor for thei ar veri insol and ar sure to ill treat
him in a wai that would greatli griev me no matter how valiant a man
mai be he can do noth against number for thei will be too strong
for him
then ulyss said sir it is right that i should sai someth
myself i am much shock about what you have said about the insol
wai in which the suitor ar behav in despit of such a man as you
ar tell me do you submit to such treatment tame or ha some god
set your peopl against you mai you not complain of your brothersfor
it is to these that a man mai look for support howev great hi
quarrel mai be i wish i were as young as you ar and in my present
mind if i were son to ulyss or inde ulyss himself i would
rather some on came and cut my head off but i would go to the hous
and be the bane of everi on of these men139 if thei were too mani for
mei be singlehandedi would rather die fight in my own hous
than see such disgrac sight dai after dai stranger grossli
maltreat and men drag the women servant about the hous in an
unseemli wai wine drawn recklessli and bread wast all to no purpos
for an end that shall never be accomplish
and telemachu answer i will tell you truli everyth there is no
enmiti between me and my peopl nor can i complain of brother to
whom a man mai look for support howev great hi quarrel mai be jove
ha made us a race of onli son laert wa the onli son of arceisiu
and ulyss onli son of laert i am myself the onli son of ulyss
who left me behind him when he went awai so that i have never been of
ani us to him henc it come that my hous is in the hand of
numberless maraud for the chief from all the neighbour island
dulichium same zacynthu as also all the princip men of ithaca
itself ar eat up my hous under the pretext of pai court to my
mother who will neither sai point blank that she will not marri nor
yet bring matter to an end so thei ar make havoc of my estat and
befor long will do so with myself into the bargain the issu
howev rest with heaven but do you old friend eumaeu go at onc
and tell penelop that i am safe and have return from pylo tell it
to herself alon and then come back here without let ani on els
know for there ar mani who ar plot mischief against me
i understand and heed you repli eumaeu you need instruct me no
further onli as i am go that wai sai whether i had not better let
poor laert know that you ar return he us to superintend the
work on hi farm in spite of hi bitter sorrow about ulyss and he
would eat and drink at will along with hi servant but thei tell me
that from the dai on which you set out for pylo he ha neither eaten
nor drunk as he ought to do nor doe he look after hi farm but sit
weep and wast the flesh from off hi bone
more the piti answer telemachu i am sorri for him but we
must leav him to himself just now if peopl could have everyth
their own wai the first thing i should choos would be the return of
my father but go and give your messag then make hast back again
and do not turn out of your wai to tell laert tell my mother to send
on of her women secretli with the new at onc and let him hear it
from her
thu did he urg the swineherd eumaeu therefor took hi sandal
bound them to hi feet and start for the town minerva watch him
well off the station and then came up to it in the form of a
womanfair state and wise she stood against the side of the entri
and reveal herself to ulyss but telemachu could not see her and
knew not that she wa there for the god do not let themselv be seen
by everybodi ulyss saw her and so did the dog for thei did not
bark but went scare and whine off to the other side of the yard
she nod her head and motion to ulyss with her eyebrow whereon
he left the hut and stood befor her outsid the main wall of the
yard then she said to him
ulyss nobl son of laert it is now time for you to tell your
son do not keep him in the dark ani longer but lai your plan for the
destruct of the suitor and then make for the town i will not be
long in join you for i too am eager for the frai
as she spoke she touch him with her golden wand first she threw a
fair clean shirt and cloak about hi shoulder then she made him
younger and of more impos presenc she gave him back hi colour
fill out hi cheek and let hi beard becom dark again then she
went awai and ulyss came back insid the hut hi son wa astound
when he saw him and turn hi ey awai for fear he might be look
upon a god
stranger said he how suddenli you have chang from what you were
a moment or two ago you ar dress differ and your colour is not
the same ar you some on or other of the god that live in heaven if
so be propiti to me till i can make you due sacrific and offer
of wrought gold have merci upon me
and ulyss said i am no god why should you take me for on i am
your father on whose account you griev and suffer so much at the
hand of lawless men
as he spoke he kiss hi son and a tear fell from hi cheek on to the
ground for he had restrain all tear till now but telemachu could
not yet believ that it wa hi father and said
you ar not my father but some god is flatter me with vain hope
that i mai griev the more hereaft no mortal man could of himself
contriv to do as you have been do and make yourself old and young
at a moment notic unless a god were with him a second ago you were
old and all in rag and now you ar like some god come down from
heaven
ulyss answer telemachu you ought not to be so immeasur
astonish at my be realli here there is no other ulyss who will
come hereaft such as i am it is i who after long wander and
much hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own countri
what you wonder at is the work of the redoubt goddess minerva who
doe with me whatev she will for she can do what she pleas at on
moment she make me like a beggar and the next i am a young man with
good cloth on my back it is an easi matter for the god who live in
heaven to make ani man look either rich or poor
as he spoke he sat down and telemachu threw hi arm about hi father
and wept thei were both so much move that thei cri aloud like
eagl or vultur with crook talon that have been rob of their
half fledg young by peasant thu piteous did thei weep and the
sun would have gone down upon their mourn if telemachu had not
suddenli said in what ship my dear father did your crew bring you
to ithaca of what nation did thei declar themselv to befor you
cannot have come by land
i will tell you the truth my son repli ulyss it wa the
phaeacian who brought me here thei ar great sailor and ar in the
habit of give escort to ani on who reach their coast thei took
me over the sea while i wa fast asleep and land me in ithaca after
give me mani present in bronz gold and raiment these thing by
heaven merci ar ly conceal in a cave and i am now come here on
the suggest of minerva that we mai consult about kill our
enemi first therefor give me a list of the suitor with their
number that i mai learn who and how mani thei ar i can then turn
the matter over in my mind and see whether we two can fight the whole
bodi of them ourselv or whether we must find other to help us
to thi telemachu answer father i have alwai heard of your
renown both in the field and in council but the task you talk of is a
veri great on i am aw at the mere thought of it two men cannot
stand against mani and brave on there ar not ten suitor onli nor
twice ten but ten mani time over you shall learn their number at
onc there ar fiftytwo chosen youth from dulichium and thei have
six servant from same there ar twentyfour twenti young achaean
from zacynthu and twelv from ithaca itself all of them well born
thei have with them a servant medon a bard and two men who can carv
at tabl if we face such number as thi you mai have bitter caus to
rue your come and your reveng see whether you cannot think of some
on who would be will to come and help us
listen to me repli ulyss and think whether minerva and her
father jove mai seem suffici or whether i am to try and find some
on els as well
those whom you have name answer telemachu ar a coupl of good
alli for though thei dwell high up among the cloud thei have power
over both god and men
these two continu ulyss will not keep long out of the frai
when the suitor and we join fight in my hous now therefor return
home earli tomorrow morn and go about among the suitor as befor
later on the swineherd will bring me to the citi disguis as a
miser old beggar if you see them ill treat me steel your heart
against my suffer even though thei drag me feet foremost out of
the hous or throw thing at me look on and do noth beyond gentli
try to make them behav more reason but thei will not listen to
you for the dai of their reckon is at hand furthermor i sai and
lai my sai to your heart when minerva shall put it in my mind i
will nod my head to you and on see me do thi you must collect all
the armour that is in the hous and hide it in the strong store room
make some excus when the suitor ask you why you ar remov it sai
that you have taken it to be out of the wai of the smoke inasmuch as
it is no longer what it wa when ulyss went awai but ha becom
soil and begrim with soot add to thi more particularli that you
ar afraid jove mai set them on to quarrel over their wine and that
thei mai do each other some harm which mai disgrac both banquet and
woo for the sight of arm sometim tempt peopl to us them but
leav a sword and a spear apiec for yourself and me and a coupl of
oxhid shield so that we can snatch them up at ani moment jove and
minerva will then soon quiet these peopl there is also anoth
matter if you ar inde my son and my blood run in your vein let
no on know that ulyss is within the houseneith laert nor yet
the swineherd nor ani of the servant nor even penelop herself let
you and me exploit the women alon and let us also make trial of some
other of the men servant to see who is on our side and whose hand is
against us
father repli telemachu you will come to know me by and by and
when you do you will find that i can keep your counsel i do not think
howev the plan you propos will turn out well for either of us
think it over it will take us a long time to go the round of the farm
and exploit the men and all the time the suitor will be wast your
estat with impun and without compunct prove the women by all
mean to see who ar disloy and who guiltless but i am not in
favour of go round and try the men we can attend to that later
on if you realli have some sign from jove that he will support you
thu did thei convers and meanwhil the ship which had brought
telemachu and hi crew from pylo had reach the town of ithaca when
thei had come insid the harbour thei drew the ship on to the land
their servant came and took their armour from them and thei left all
the present at the hous of clytiu then thei sent a servant to tell
penelop that telemachu had gone into the countri but had sent the
ship to the town to prevent her from be alarm and made unhappi
thi servant and eumaeu happen to meet when thei were both on the
same errand of go to tell penelop when thei reach the hous the
servant stood up and said to the queen in the presenc of the wait
women your son madam is now return from pylo but eumaeu went
close up to penelop and said privat all that her son had bidden
him tell her when he had given hi messag he left the hous with it
outbuild and went back to hi pig again
the suitor were surpris and angri at what had happen so thei went
outsid the great wall that ran round the outer court and held a
council near the main entranc eurymachu son of polybu wa the
first to speak
my friend said he thi voyag of telemachuss is a veri seriou
matter we had made sure that it would come to noth now howev
let us draw a ship into the water and get a crew togeth to send
after the other and tell them to come back as fast as thei can
he had hardli done speak when amphinomu turn in hi place and saw
the ship insid the harbour with the crew lower her sail and
put by their oar so he laugh and said to the other we need
not send them ani messag for thei ar here some god must have told
them or els thei saw the ship go by and could not overtak her
on thi thei rose and went to the water side the crew then drew the
ship on shore their servant took their armour from them and thei
went up in a bodi to the place of assembl but thei would not let ani
on old or young sit along with them and antin son of eupeith
spoke first
good heaven said he see how the god have save thi man from
destruct we kept a success of scout upon the headland all dai
long and when the sun wa down we never went on shore to sleep but
wait in the ship all night till morn in the hope of captur and
kill him but some god ha convei him home in spite of us let us
consid how we can make an end of him he must not escap us our
affair is never like to come off while he is aliv for he is veri
shrewd and public feel is by no mean all on our side we must make
hast befor he can call the achaean in assembl he will lose no time
in do so for he will be furiou with us and will tell all the
world how we plot to kill him but fail to take him the peopl
will not like thi when thei come to know of it we must see that thei
do us no hurt nor drive us from our own countri into exil let us try
and lai hold of him either on hi farm awai from the town or on the
road hither then we can divid up hi properti amongst us and let hi
mother and the man who marri her have the hous if thi doe not
pleas you and you wish telemachu to live on and hold hi father
properti then we must not gather here and eat up hi good in thi
wai but must make our offer to penelop each from hi own hous and
she can marri the man who will give the most for her and whose lot it
is to win her
thei all held their peac until amphinomu rose to speak he wa the
son of nisu who wa son to king aretia and he wa foremost among
all the suitor from the wheatgrow and well grass island of
dulichium hi convers moreov wa more agreeabl to penelop
than that of ani of the other suitor for he wa a man of good natur
disposit my friend said he speak to them plainli and in all
honestli i am not in favour of kill telemachu it is a heinou
thing to kill on who is of nobl blood let us first take counsel of
the god and if the oracl of jove advis it i will both help to
kill him myself and will urg everyon els to do so but if thei
dissuad us i would have you hold your hand
thu did he speak and hi word pleas them well so thei rose
forthwith and went to the hous of ulyss where thei took their
accustom seat
then penelop resolv that she would show herself to the suitor she
knew of the plot against telemachu for the servant medon had
overheard their counsel and had told her she went down therefor to
the court attend by her maiden and when she reach the suitor she
stood by on of the bearingpost support the roof of the cloister
hold a veil befor her face and rebuk antin sai
antin insol and wick schemer thei sai you ar the best
speaker and counsellor of ani man your own ag in ithaca but you ar
noth of the kind madman why should you try to compass the death of
telemachu and take no heed of suppliant whose wit is jove
himself it is not right for you to plot thu against on anoth do
you not rememb how your father fled to thi hous in fear of the
peopl who were enrag against him for have gone with some taphian
pirat and plunder the thesprotian who were at peac with us thei
want to tear him in piec and eat up everyth he had but ulyss
stai their hand although thei were infuri and now you devour
hi properti without pai for it and break my heart by woo hi
wife and try to kill hi son leav off do so and stop the
other also
to thi eurymachu son of polybu answer take heart queen penelop
daughter of icariu and do not troubl yourself about these matter
the man is not yet born nor never will be who shall lai hand upon
your son telemachu while i yet live to look upon the face of the
earth i sayand it shall sure bethat my spear shall be redden
with hi blood for mani a time ha ulyss taken me on hi knee held
wine up to my lip to drink and put piec of meat into my hand
therefor telemachu is much the dearest friend i have and ha noth
to fear from the hand of us suitor of cours if death come to him
from the god he cannot escap it he said thi to quiet her but in
realiti he wa plot against telemachu
then penelop went upstair again and mourn her husband till minerva
shed sleep over her ey in the even eumaeu got back to ulyss
and hi son who had just sacrif a young pig of a year old and were
help on anoth to get supper readi minerva therefor came up to
ulyss turn him into an old man with a stroke of her wand and clad
him in hi old cloth again for fear that the swineherd might
recognis him and not keep the secret but go and tell penelop
telemachu wa the first to speak so you have got back eumaeu
said he what is the new of the town have the suitor return or
ar thei still wait over yonder to take me on my wai home
i did not think of ask about that repli eumaeu when i wa in
the town i thought i would give my messag and come back as soon as i
could i met a man sent by those who had gone with you to pylo and he
wa the first to tell the new to your mother but i can sai what i saw
with my own ey i had just got on to the crest of the hill of mercuri
abov the town when i saw a ship come into harbour with a number of
men in her thei had mani shield and spear and i thought it wa the
suitor but i cannot be sure
on hear thi telemachu smile to hi father but so that eumaeu
could not see him
then when thei had finish their work and the meal wa readi thei
at it and everi man had hi full share so that all were satisfi as
soon as thei had had enough to eat and drink thei laid down to rest
and enjoi the boon of sleep

thu did thei convers meanwhil the suitor were throw disc or
aim with spear at a mark on the level ground in front of the
hous and behav with all their old insol but when it wa now
time for dinner and the flock of sheep and goat had come into the
town from all the countri round 140 with their shepherd as usual
then medon who wa their favourit servant and who wait upon them
at tabl said now then my young master you have had enough sport

colder142
i know and understand you repli ulyss you need sai no more

as he spoke he threw hi shabbi old tatter wallet over hi shoulder
by the cord from which it hung and eumaeu gave him a stick to hi
like the two then start leav the station in charg of the dog
and herdsmen who remain behind the swineherd led the wai and hi
master follow after look like some broken down old tramp as he
lean upon hi staff and hi cloth were all in rag when thei had
got over the rough steep ground and were near the citi thei reach
the fountain from which the citizen drew their water thi had been
made by ithacu neritu and polyctor there wa a grove of
waterlov poplar plant in a circl all round it and the clear
cold water came down to it from a rock high up143 while abov the
fountain there wa an altar to the nymph at which all wayfar us
to sacrific here melanthiu son of doliu overtook them as he wa
drive down some goat the best in hi flock for the suitor
dinner and there were two shepherd with him when he saw eumaeu and
ulyss he revil them with outrag and unseemli languag which
made ulyss veri angri
there you go cri he and a preciou pair you ar see how heaven
bring bird of the same feather to on anoth where prai master
swineherd ar you take thi poor miser object it would make ani
on sick to see such a creatur at tabl a fellow like thi never won
a prize for anyth in hi life but will go about rub hi
shoulder against everi man door post and beg not for sword
and cauldrons144 like a man but onli for a few scrap not worth
beg for if you would give him to me for a hand on my station he
might do to clean out the fold or bring a bit of sweet feed to the
kid and he could fatten hi thigh as much as he pleas on whei but
he ha taken to bad wai and will not go about ani kind of work he
will do noth but beg victual all the town over to feed hi
insati belli i sai thereforeand it shall sure beif he goe
near ulyss hous he will get hi head broken by the stool thei will
fling at him till thei turn him out
on thi as he pass he gave ulyss a kick on the hip out of pure
wanton but ulyss stood firm and did not budg from the path
for a moment he doubt whether or no to fly at melanthiu and kill him
with hi staff or fling him to the ground and beat hi brain out he
resolv howev to endur it and keep himself in check but the
swineherd look straight at melanthiu and rebuk him lift up hi
hand and prai to heaven as he did so
fountain nymph he cri children of jove if ever ulyss burn
you thigh bone cover with fat whether of lamb or kid grant my
prayer that heaven mai send him home he would soon put an end to the
swagger threat with which such men as you go about insult
peoplegad all over the town while your flock ar go to ruin
through bad shepherd
then melanthiu the goatherd answer you ill condit cur what
ar you talk about some dai or other i will put you on board ship
and take you to a foreign countri where i can sell you and pocket the
monei you will fetch i wish i were as sure that apollo would strike
telemachu dead thi veri dai or that the suitor would kill him as i
am that ulyss will never come home again
with thi he left them to come on at their leisur while he went
quickli forward and soon reach the hous of hi master when he got
there he went in and took hi seat among the suitor opposit
eurymachu who like him better than ani of the other the servant
brought him a portion of meat and an upper woman servant set bread
befor him that he might eat present ulyss and the swineherd came
up to the hous and stood by it amid a sound of music for phemiu wa
just begin to sing to the suitor then ulyss took hold of the
swineherd hand and said
eumaeu thi hous of ulyss is a veri fine place no matter how far
you go you will find few like it on build keep follow on
after anoth the outer court ha a wall with battlement all round
it the door ar doubl fold and of good workmanship it would be
a hard matter to take it by forc of arm i perceiv too that there
ar mani peopl banquet within it for there is a smell of roast
meat and i hear a sound of music which the god have made to go along
with feast
then eumaeu said you have perceiv aright as inde you gener
do but let us think what will be our best cours will you go insid
first and join the suitor leav me here behind you or will you
wait here and let me go in first but do not wait long or some on mai

i am caseharden and thi too mai go with the rest but a man cannot
hide awai the crave of a hungri belli thi is an enemi which give
much troubl to all men it is becaus of thi that ship ar fit
out to sail the sea and to make war upon other peopl
as thei were thu talk a dog that had been ly asleep rais hi
head and prick up hi ear thi wa argo whom ulyss had bred
befor set out for troi but he had never had ani work out of him
in the old dai he us to be taken out by the young men when thei went
hunt wild goat or deer or hare but now that hi master wa gone
he wa ly neglect on the heap of mule and cow dung that lai in
front of the stabl door till the men should come and draw it awai to
manur the great close and he wa full of flea as soon as he saw
ulyss stand there he drop hi ear and wag hi tail but he
could not get close up to hi master when ulyss saw the dog on the
other side of the yard he dash a tear from hi ey without eumaeu
see it and said
eumaeu what a nobl hound that is over yonder on the manur heap
hi build is splendid is he as fine a fellow as he look or is he
onli on of those dog that come beg about a tabl and ar kept
mere for show
thi hound answer eumaeu belong to him who ha di in a far
countri if he were what he wa when ulyss left for troi he would
soon show you what he could do there wa not a wild beast in the
forest that could get awai from him when he wa onc on it track but
now he ha fallen on evil time for hi master is dead and gone and
the women take no care of him servant never do their work when their
master hand is no longer over them for jove take half the good
out of a man when he make a slave of him
as he spoke he went insid the build to the cloister where the
suitor were but argo di as soon as he had recognis hi master
telemachu saw eumaeu long befor ani on els did and beckon him
to come and sit besid him so he look about and saw a seat ly
near where the carver sat serv out their portion to the suitor he
pick it up brought it to telemachuss tabl and sat down opposit
him then the servant brought him hi portion and gave him bread from
the breadbasket
immedi afterward ulyss came insid look like a poor
miser old beggar lean on hi staff and with hi cloth all in
rag he sat down upon the threshold of ashwood just insid the door
lead from the outer to the inner court and against a bearingpost
of cypresswood which the carpent had skilfulli plane and had made
to join truli with rule and line telemachu took a whole loaf from the
breadbasket with as much meat as he could hold in hi two hand and
said to eumaeu take thi to the stranger and tell him to go the
round of the suitor and beg from them a beggar must not be
shamefac
so eumaeu went up to him and said stranger telemachu send you
thi and sai you ar to go the round of the suitor beg for
beggar must not be shamefac
ulyss answer mai king jove grant all happi to telemachu and
fulfil the desir of hi heart
then with both hand he took what telemachu had sent him and laid it
on the dirti old wallet at hi feet he went on eat it while the
bard wa sing and had just finish hi dinner as he left off the
suitor applaud the bard whereon minerva went up to ulyss and
prompt him to beg piec of bread from each on of the suitor that
he might see what kind of peopl thei were and tell the good from the
bad but come what might she wa not go to save a singl on of
them ulyss therefor went on hi round go from left to right
and stretch out hi hand to beg as though he were a real beggar
some of them piti him and were curiou about him ask on anoth
who he wa and where he came from whereon the goatherd melanthiu
said suitor of my nobl mistress i can tell you someth about

on thi antin began to abus the swineherd you preciou idiot he
cri what have you brought thi man to town for have we not tramp
and beggar enough alreadi to pester us as we sit at meat do you think
it a small thing that such peopl gather here to wast your master
propertyand must you need bring thi man as well
and eumaeu answer antin your birth is good but your word
evil it wa no do of mine that he came here who is like to
invit a stranger from a foreign countri unless it be on of those who
can do public servic as a seer a healer of hurt a carpent or a
bard who can charm us with hi sing such men ar welcom all the
world over but no on is like to ask a beggar who will onli worri
him you ar alwai harder on ulyss servant than ani of the other
suitor ar and abov all on me but i do not care so long as
telemachu and penelop ar aliv and here
but telemachu said hush do not answer him antin ha the
bitterest tongu of all the suitor and he make the other wors
then turn to antin he said antin you take as much care of
my interest as though i were your son why should you want to see thi
stranger turn out of the hous heaven forbid take someth and
give it him yourself i do not grudg it i bid you take it never mind
my mother nor ani of the other servant in the hous but i know you
will not do what i sai for you ar more fond of eat thing yourself
than of give them to other peopl
what do you mean telemachu repli antin by thi swagger
talk if all the suitor were to give him as much as i will he would
not come here again for anoth three month
as he spoke he drew the stool on which he rest hi dainti feet from
under the tabl and made as though he would throw it at ulyss but
the other suitor all gave him someth and fill hi wallet with
bread and meat he wa about therefor to go back to the threshold
and eat what the suitor had given him but he first went up to
antin and said
sir give me someth you ar not sure the poorest man here you
seem to be a chief foremost among them all therefor you should be
the better giver and i will tell far and wide of your bounti i too
wa a rich man onc and had a fine hous of my own in those dai i
gave to mani a tramp such as i now am no matter who he might be nor
what he want i had ani number of servant and all the other thing
which peopl have who live well and ar account wealthi but it
pleas jove to take all awai from me he sent me with a band of rove
robber to egypt it wa a long voyag and i wa undon by it i
station my ship in the river aegyptu and bade my men stai by them
and keep guard over them while i sent out scout to reconnoitr from
everi point of vantag
but the men disobei my order took to their own devic and
ravag the land of the egyptian kill the men and take their
wive and children captiv the alarm wa soon carri to the citi
and when thei heard the warcri the peopl came out at daybreak till
the plain wa fill with soldier hors and foot and with the gleam
of armour then jove spread panic among my men and thei would no
longer face the enemi for thei found themselv surround the
egyptian kill mani of us and took the rest aliv to do forc
labour for them as for myself thei gave me to a friend who met them
to take to cypru dmetor by name son of iasu who wa a great man in
cypru thenc i am come hither in a state of great miseri
then antin said what god can have sent such a pestil to plagu

will give you egypt and cypru over again for your insol and
importun you have beg of all the other and thei have given you
lavishli for thei have abund round them and it is easi to be free
with other peopl properti when there is plenti of it
on thi ulyss began to move off and said your look my fine sir
ar better than your breed if you were in your own hous you would
not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt for though you ar in
anoth man and surround with abund you cannot find it in you
to give him even a piec of bread
thi made antin veri angri and he scowl at him sai you shall
pai for thi befor you get clear of the court with these word he
threw a footstool at him and hit him on the right shoulder blade near
the top of hi back ulyss stood firm as a rock and the blow did not
even stagger him but he shook hi head in silenc as he brood on hi
reveng then he went back to the threshold and sat down there lai
hi well fill wallet at hi feet
listen to me he cri you suitor of queen penelop that i mai
speak even as i am mind a man know neither ach nor pain if he get
hit while fight for hi monei or for hi sheep or hi cattl and
even so antin ha hit me while in the servic of my miser belli
which is alwai get peopl into troubl still if the poor have

a bad end befor hi marriag
sit where you ar and eat your victual in silenc or be off
elsewher shout antin if you sai more i will have you drag
hand and foot through the court and the servant shall flai you
aliv
the other suitor were much displeas at thi and on of the young
men said antin you did ill in strike that poor wretch of a
tramp it will be wors for you if he should turn out to be some
godand we know the god go about disguis in all sort of wai as
peopl from foreign countri and travel about the world to see who do
amiss and who righteously146
thu said the suitor but antin paid them no heed meanwhil
telemachu wa furiou about the blow that had been given to hi
father and though no tear fell from him he shook hi head in silenc
and brood on hi reveng
now when penelop heard that the beggar had been struck in the
banquetingcloist she said befor her maid would that apollo
would so strike you antin and her wait woman eurynom
answer if our prayer were answer not on of the suitor would
ever again see the sun rise then penelop said nurse147 i hate

hate antin like the dark of death itself a poor unfortun
tramp ha come beg about the hous for sheer want everi on els
ha given him someth to put in hi wallet but antin ha hit him
on the right shoulderblad with a footstool
thu did she talk with her maid as she sat in her own room and in the
meantim ulyss wa get hi dinner then she call for the
swineherd and said eumaeu go and tell the stranger to come here i
want to see him and ask him some question he seem to have travel

between hi hous and that of ulyss and that he come from crete
where the descend of mino live after have been driven hither
and thither by everi kind of misfortun he also declar that he ha
heard of ulyss as be aliv and near at hand among the
thesprotian and that he is bring great wealth home with him
call him here then said penelop that i too mai hear hi stori

unwast in their hous with none but servant to consum them while
thei keep hang about our hous dai after dai sacrif our oxen
sheep and fat goat for their banquet and never give so much as a
thought to the quantiti of wine thei drink no estat can stand such
reckless for we have now no ulyss to protect us if he were to

as she spoke telemachu sneez so loudli that the whole hous

suitor for their pride and insol reach heaven just now
moreov as i wa go about the hous without do ani harm a man
gave me a blow that hurt me veri much but neither telemachu nor ani
on els defend me tell penelop therefor to be patient and wait
till sundown let her give me a seat close up to the fire for my
cloth ar worn veri thinyou know thei ar for you have seen them
ever sinc i first ask you to help mesh can then ask me about the
return of her husband
the swineherd went back when he heard thi and penelop said as she
saw him cross the threshold why do you not bring him here eumaeu
is he afraid that some on will illtreat him or is he shy of come
insid the hous at all beggar should not be shamefac

reason he is avoid the suitor and is onli do what ani on
els would do he ask you to wait till sundown and it will be much
better madam that you should have him all to yourself when you can
hear him and talk to him as you will
the man is no fool answer penelop it would veri like be as he
sai for there ar no such abomin peopl in the whole world as
these men ar
when she had done speak eumaeu went back to the suitor for he had
explain everyth then he went up to telemachu and said in hi ear
so that none could overhear him my dear sir i will now go back to

howev that none of you will give me a foul blow to favour iru and
secur him the victori
thei swore as he told them and when thei had complet their oath
telemachu put in a word and said stranger if you have a mind to
settl with thi fellow you need not be afraid of ani on here
whoever strike you will have to fight more than on i am host and
the other chief antin and eurymachu both of them men of
understand ar of the same mind as i am
everi on assent and ulyss gird hi old rag about hi loin
thu bare hi stalwart thigh hi broad chest and shoulder and hi
mighti arm but minerva came up to him and made hi limb even
stronger still the suitor were beyond measur astonish and on
would turn toward hi neighbour sai the stranger ha brought such
a thigh out of hi old rag that there will soon be noth left of
iru
iru began to be veri uneasi as he heard them but the servant gird
him by forc and brought him into the open part of the court in such
a fright that hi limb were all of a trembl antin scold him and
said you swagger bulli you ought never to have been born at all
if you ar afraid of such an old broken down creatur as thi tramp is
i sai thereforeand it shall sure beif he beat you and prove
himself the better man i shall pack you off on board ship to the
mainland and send you to king echetu who kill everi on that come
near him he will cut off your nose and ear and draw out your
entrail for the dog to eat
thi frighten iru still more but thei brought him into the middl
of the court and the two men rais their hand to fight then ulyss
consid whether he should let drive so hard at him as to make an end
of him then and there or whether he should give him a lighter blow
that should onli knock him down in the end he deem it best to give
the lighter blow for fear the achaean should begin to suspect who he
wa then thei began to fight and iru hit ulyss on the right
shoulder but ulyss gave iru a blow on the neck under the ear that
broke in the bone of hi skull and the blood came gush out of hi
mouth he fell groan in the dust gnash hi teeth and kick on
the ground but the suitor threw up their hand and nearli di of
laughter as ulyss caught hold of him by the foot and drag him
into the outer court as far as the gatehous there he prop him up
against the wall and put hi staff in hi hand sit here said he
and keep the dog and pig off you ar a piti creatur and if you
try to make yourself king of the beggar ani more you shall fare still
wors
then he threw hi dirti old wallet all tatter and torn over hi
shoulder with the cord by which it hung and went back to sit down upon
the threshold but the suitor went within the cloister laugh and
salut him mai jove and all the other god said thei grant you
whatev you want for have put an end to the importun of thi
insati tramp we will take him over to the mainland present to
king echetu who kill everi on that come near him
ulyss hail thi as of good omen and antin set a great goat
paunch befor him fill with blood and fat amphinomu took two loav
out of the breadbasket and brought them to him pledg him as he did
so in a golden goblet of wine good luck to you he said father
stranger you ar veri badli off at present but i hope you will have
better time by and by

both brave and wealthi thei tell me you ar hi son and you appear to
be a consider person listen therefor and take heed to what i am
sai man is the vainest of all creatur that have their be upon
earth as long as heaven vouchsaf him health and strength he think
that he shall come to no harm hereaft and even when the bless god
bring sorrow upon him he bear it as he need must and make the best
of it for god almighti give men their daili mind dai by dai i know
all about it for i wa a rich man onc and did much wrong in the
stubborn of my pride and in the confid that my father and my
brother would support me therefor let a man fear god in all thing
alwai and take the good that heaven mai see fit to send him without
vain glori consid the infami of what these suitor ar do see

nai he will be here soon mai heaven send you home quietli first that
you mai not meet with him in the dai of hi come for onc he is here
the suitor and he will not part bloodlessli
with these word he made a drinkoff and when he had drunk he put
the gold cup again into the hand of amphinomu who walk awai
seriou and bow hi head for he forebod evil but even so he did
not escap destruct for minerva had doom him to fall by the hand
of telemachu so he took hi seat again at the place from which he had
come
then minerva put it into the mind of penelop to show herself to the
suitor that she might make them still more enamour of her and win
still further honour from her son and husband so she feign a mock
laugh and said eurynom i have chang my mind and have a fanci to
show myself to the suitor although i detest them i should like also
to give my son a hint that he had better not have anyth more to do
with them thei speak fairli enough but thei mean mischief
my dear child answer eurynom all that you have said is true go
and tell your son about it but first wash yourself and anoint your
face do not go about with your cheek all cover with tear it is
not right that you should griev so incessantli for telemachu whom

grown up
i know eurynom repli penelop that you mean well but do not
try and persuad me to wash and to anoint myself for heaven rob me
of all my beauti on the dai my husband sail nevertheless tell
autono and hippodamia that i want them thei must be with me when i am
in the cloister i am not go among the men alon it would not be
proper for me to do so
on thi the old woman150 went out of the room to bid the maid go to
their mistress in the meantim minerva bethought her of anoth
matter and sent penelop off into a sweet slumber so she lai down on
her couch and her limb becam heavi with sleep then the goddess shed
grace and beauti over her that all the achaean might admir her she
wash her face with the ambrosi loveli that venu wear when she
goe danc with the grace she made her taller and of a more
command figur while as for her complexion it wa whiter than sawn
ivori when minerva had done all thi she went awai whereon the maid
came in from the women room and woke penelop with the sound of their
talk

diana would let me die so sweetli now at thi veri moment that i might
no longer wast in despair for the loss of my dear husband who

with these word she came down from her upper room not alon but
attend by two of her maiden and when she reach the suitor she
stood by on of the bearingpost support the roof of the cloister
hold a veil befor her face and with a staid maid servant on either
side of her as thei beheld her the suitor were so overpow and
becam so desper enamour of her that each on prai he might
win her for hi own bed fellow
telemachu said she address her son i fear you ar no longer
so discreet and well conduct as you us to be when you were younger
you had a greater sens of proprieti now howev that you ar grown
up though a stranger to look at you would take you for the son of a
well to do father as far as size and good look go your conduct is by
no mean what it should be what is all thi disturb that ha been

illtreat what would have happen if he had suffer seriou injuri

between iru and the stranger did not turn out as the suitor meant it
to do for the stranger got the best of it i wish father jove
minerva and apollo would break the neck of everi on of these wooer
of your some insid the hous and some out and i wish thei might all

magnific present instead of eat up other peopl properti
without pai for it
thi wa what she said and ulyss wa glad when he heard her try
to get present out of the suitor and flatter them with fair word
which he knew she did not mean
then antin said queen penelop daughter of icariu take as mani
present as you pleas from ani on who will give them to you it is

book xix
telemachu and ulyss remov the armourulyss interview
penelopeeuryclea wash hi feet and recognis the scar on hi

ulyss wa left in the cloister ponder on the mean wherebi with
minerva help he might be abl to kill the suitor present he said
to telemachu telemachu we must get the armour togeth and take it
down insid make some excus when the suitor ask you why you have
remov it sai that you have taken it to be out of the wai of the
smoke inasmuch as it is no longer what it wa when ulyss went awai
but ha becom soil and begrim with soot add to thi more
particularli that you ar afraid jove mai set them on to quarrel over
their wine and that thei mai do each other some harm which mai
disgrac both banquet and woo for the sight of arm sometim
tempt peopl to us them
telemachu approv of what hi father had said so he call nurs
euryclea and said nurs shut the women up in their room while i
take the armour that my father left behind him down into the store
room no on look after it now my father is gone and it ha got all
smirch with soot dure my own boyhood i want to take it down where
the smoke cannot reach it
i wish child answer euryclea that you would take the manag
of the hous into your own hand altogeth and look after all the
properti yourself but who is to go with you and light you to the
storeroom the maid would have done so but you would not let them
the stranger said telemachu shall show me a light when peopl
eat my bread thei must earn it no matter where thei come from
euryclea did as she wa told and bolt the women insid their room
then ulyss and hi son made all hast to take the helmet shield
and spear insid and minerva went befor them with a gold lamp in her
hand that shed a soft and brilliant radianc whereon telemachu said
father my ey behold a great marvel the wall with the rafter
crossbeam and the support on which thei rest ar all aglow as with a
flame fire sure there is some god here who ha come down from
heaven
hush answer ulyss hold your peac and ask no question for
thi is the manner of the god get you to your bed and leav me here
to talk with your mother and the maid your mother in her grief will
ask me all sort of question
on thi telemachu went by torchlight to the other side of the inner
court to the room in which he alwai slept there he lai in hi bed
till morn while ulyss wa left in the cloister ponder on the
mean wherebi with minerva help he might be abl to kill the suitor
then penelop came down from her room look like venu or diana and
thei set her a seat inlaid with scroll of silver and ivori near the
fire in her accustom place it had been made by icmaliu and had a
footstool all in on piec with the seat itself and it wa cover
with a thick fleec on thi she now sat and the maid came from the
women room to join her thei set about remov the tabl at which
the wick suitor had been dine and took awai the bread that wa
left with the cup from which thei had drunk thei empti the ember
out of the brazier and heap much wood upon them to give both light

stranger do you mean to plagu us by hang about the hous all
night and spy upon the women be off you wretch outsid and eat
your supper there or you shall be driven out with a firebrand
ulyss scowl at her and answer my good woman why should you be

place in which you now wanton abov your fellow have a care lest you
get out of favour with your mistress and lest ulyss should come
home for there is still a chanc that he mai do so moreov though
he be dead as you think he is yet by apollo will he ha left a son
behind him telemachu who will note anyth done amiss by the maid
in the hous for he is now no longer in hi boyhood
penelop heard what he wa sai and scold the maid impud
baggag said she i see how abomin you ar behav and you
shall smart for it you knew perfectli well for i told you myself
that i wa go to see the stranger and ask him about my husband for

then ulyss answer madam wife of ulyss sinc you persist in
ask me about my famili i will answer no matter what it cost me
peopl must expect to be pain when thei have been exil as long as i
have and suffer as much among as mani peopl nevertheless as
regard your question i will tell you all you ask there is a fair and
fruit island in midocean call crete it is thickli peopl and
there ar nineti citi in it the peopl speak mani differ
languag which overlap on anoth for there ar achaean brave
eteocretan dorian of threefold race and nobl pelasgi there is a
great town there cnossu where mino reign who everi nine year had
a confer with jove himself152 mino wa father to deucalion whose
son i am for deucalion had two son idomeneu and myself idomeneu
sail for troi and i who am the younger am call aethon my
brother howev wa at onc the older and the more valiant of the
two henc it wa in crete that i saw ulyss and show him
hospit for the wind took him there as he wa on hi wai to troi
carri him out of hi cours from cape malea and leav him in
amnisu off the cave of ilithuia where the harbour ar difficult to
enter and he could hardli find shelter from the wind that were then
rage as soon as he got there he went into the town and ask for
idomeneu claim to be hi old and valu friend but idomeneu had
alreadi set sail for troi some ten or twelv dai earlier so i took
him to my own hous and show him everi kind of hospit for i had
abund of everyth moreov i fed the men who were with him with
barlei meal from the public store and got subscript of wine and
oxen for them to sacrific to their heart content thei stai with
me twelv dai for there wa a gale blow from the north so strong
that on could hardli keep on feet on land i suppos some
unfriendli god had rais it for them but on the thirteenth dai the
wind drop and thei got awai
mani a plausibl tale did ulyss further tell her and penelop wept
as she listen for her heart wa melt as the snow wast upon the
mountain top when the wind from south east and west have breath
upon it and thaw it till the river run bank full with water even so
did her cheek overflow with tear for the husband who wa all the time
sit by her side ulyss felt for her and wa sorri for her but he
kept hi ey as hard as horn or iron without let them so much as
quiver so cunningli did he restrain hi tear then when she had
reliev herself by weep she turn to him again and said now
stranger i shall put you to the test and see whether or no you realli
did entertain my husband and hi men as you sai you did tell me
then how he wa dress what kind of a man he wa to look at and so
also with hi companion
madam answer ulyss it is such a long time ago that i can
hardli sai twenti year ar come and gone sinc he left my home and
went elsewhith but i will tell you as well as i can recollect
ulyss wore a mantl of purpl wool doubl line and it wa fasten
by a gold brooch with two catch for the pin on the face of thi
there wa a devic that shew a dog hold a spot fawn between hi
fore paw and watch it as it lai pant upon the ground everi on
marvel at the wai in which these thing had been done in gold the
dog look at the fawn and strangl it while the fawn wa
struggl convuls to escape153 as for the shirt that he wore
next hi skin it wa so soft that it fit him like the skin of an
onion and glisten in the sunlight to the admir of all the women
who beheld it furthermor i sai and lai my sai to your heart that
i do not know whether ulyss wore these cloth when he left home or
whether on of hi companion had given them to him while he wa on hi
voyag or possibl some on at whose hous he wa stai made him a
present of them for he wa a man of mani friend and had few equal
among the achaean i myself gave him a sword of bronz and a beauti
purpl mantl doubl line with a shirt that went down to hi feet
and i sent him on board hi ship with everi mark of honour he had a
servant with him a littl older than himself and i can tell you what
he wa like hi shoulder were hunched154 he wa dark and he had
thick curli hair hi name wa euryb and ulyss treat him with
greater familiar than he did ani of the other as be the most
likemind with himself
penelop wa move still more deepli as she heard the indisput
proof that ulyss laid befor her and when she had again found
relief in tear she said to him stranger i wa alreadi dispos to
piti you but henceforth you shall be honour and made welcom in my
hous it wa i who gave ulyss the cloth you speak of i took them
out of the store room and fold them up myself and i gave him also
the gold brooch to wear as an ornament ala i shall never welcom him
home again it wa by an ill fate that he ever set out for that
detest citi whose veri name i cannot bring myself even to mention
then ulyss answer madam wife of ulyss do not disfigur
yourself further by griev thu bitterli for your loss though i can
hardli blame you for do so a woman who ha love her husband and
born him children would natur be griev at lose him even
though he were a wors man than ulyss who thei sai wa like a god

hi grandmoth amphithea threw her arm about him and kiss hi
head and both hi beauti ey while autolycu desir hi son to

when the child of morn rosyfing dawn appear the son of

thei climb the wood slope of parnassu and soon reach it breezi
upland vallei but as the sun wa begin to beat upon the field
freshrisen from the slow still current of oceanu thei came to a
mountain dell the dog were in front search for the track of the
beast thei were chase and after them came the son of autolycu
among whom wa ulyss close behind the dog and he had a long spear
in hi hand here wa the lair of a huge boar among some thick
brushwood so dens that the wind and rain could not get through it
nor could the sun rai pierc it and the ground underneath lai thick
with fallen leav the boar heard the nois of the men feet and the

ulyss hit him on the right shoulder and the point of the spear went
right through him so that he fell groan in the dust until the life

fell into the bath which rang out and wa overturn so that all the
water wa spilt on the ground euryclea ey between her joi and her

ulyss slept in the cloister upon an undress bullock hide on the
top of which he threw sever skin of the sheep the suitor had eaten
and eurynome156 threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself down
there then ulyss lai wakefulli brood upon the wai in which he
should kill the suitor and by and by the women who had been in the
habit of misconduct themselv with them left the hous giggl
and laugh with on anoth thi made ulyss veri angri and he
doubt whether to get up and kill everi singl on of them then and
there or to let them sleep on more and last time with the suitor
hi heart growl within him and as a bitch with puppi growl and
show her teeth when she see a stranger so did hi heart growl with
anger at the evil deed that were be done but he beat hi breast
and said heart be still you had wors than thi to bear on the dai
when the terribl cyclop at your brave companion yet you bore it in

he mai get it cook as soon as possibl even so did he turn himself
about from side to side think all the time how singl hand as he

as she spoke she shed sleep over hi ey and then went back to
olympu
while ulyss wa thu yield himself to a veri deep slumber that
eas the burden of hi sorrow hi admir wife awok and sit
up in her bed began to cry when she had reliev herself by weep
she prai to diana sai great goddess diana daughter of jove
drive an arrow into my heart and slai me or let some whirlwind snatch
me up and bear me through path of dark till it drop me into the
mouth of overflow oceanu as it did the daughter of pandareu
the daughter of pandareu lost their father and mother for the god

and fed them on chees honei and sweet wine juno taught them to
excel all women in beauti of form and understand diana gave them an

jove about get them marri for well doe he know both what shall
happen and what not happen to everi on the storm wind came and
spirit them awai to becom handmaid to the dread eriny even so i
wish that the god who live in heaven would hide me from mortal sight
or that fair diana might strike me for i would fain go even beneath
the sad earth if i might do so still look toward ulyss onli and
without have to yield myself to a wors man than he wa besid no
matter how much peopl mai griev by dai thei can put up with it so
long as thei can sleep at night for when the ey ar close in
slumber peopl forget good and ill alik wherea my miseri haunt me
even in my dream thi veri night methought there wa on ly by my
side who wa like ulyss as he wa when he went awai with hi host
and i rejoic for i believ that it wa no dream but the veri truth
itself
on thi the dai broke but ulyss heard the sound of her weep and
it puzzl him for it seem as though she alreadi knew him and wa by
hi side then he gather up the cloak and the fleec on which he had
lain and set them on a seat in the cloister but he took the bullock
hide out into the open he lift up hi hand to heaven and prai
sai father jove sinc you have seen fit to bring me over land and
sea to my own home after all the afflict you have laid upon me

from outsid
thu did he prai jove heard hi prayer and forthwith thunder high up
among the cloud from the splendour of olympu and ulyss wa glad
when he heard it at the same time within the hous a millerwoman
from hard by in the mill room lift up her voic and gave him anoth
sign there were twelv millerwomen whose busi it wa to grind
wheat and barlei which ar the staff of life the other had ground
their task and had gone to take their rest but thi on had not yet
finish for she wa not so strong as thei were and when she heard
the thunder she stop grind and gave the sign to her master
father jove said she you who rule over heaven and earth you have
thunder from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it and thi
mean someth for somebodi grant the prayer then of me your poor
servant who call upon you and let thi be the veri last dai that the
suitor dine in the hous of ulyss thei have worn me out with labour
of grind meal for them and i hope thei mai never have anoth
dinner anywher at all
ulyss wa glad when he heard the omen convei to him by the woman
speech and by the thunder for he knew thei meant that he should
aveng himself on the suitor
then the other maid in the hous rose and lit the fire on the hearth
telemachu also rose and put on hi cloth he gird hi sword about
hi shoulder bound hi sandal on to hi come feet and took a
doughti spear with a point of sharpen bronz then he went to the
threshold of the cloister and said to euryclea nurs did you make
the stranger comfort both as regard bed and board or did you let
him shift for himselffor my mother good woman though she is ha a
wai of pai great attent to secondr peopl and of neglect
other who ar in realiti much better men
do not find fault child said euryclea when there is no on to find
fault with the stranger sat and drank hi wine as long as he like
your mother did ask him if he would take ani more bread and he said he
would not when he want to go to bed she told the servant to make
on for him but he said he wa such a wretch outcast that he would
not sleep on a bed and under blanket he insist on have an
undress bullock hide and some sheepskin put for him in the
cloister and i threw a cloak over him myself157
then telemachu went out of the court to the place where the achaean
were meet in assembl he had hi spear in hi hand and he wa not
alon for hi two dog went with him but euryclea call the maid
and said come wake up set about sweep the cloister and

seat wipe down the tabl some of you with a wet spong clean out

it is a feast dai
thu did she speak and thei did even as she had said twenti of them
went to the fountain for water and the other set themselv busili to
work about the hous the men who were in attend on the suitor
also came up and began chop firewood by and by the women return
from the fountain and the swineherd came after them with the three
best pig he could pick out these he let feed about the premis and
then he said goodhumouredli to ulyss stranger ar the suitor

ulyss made no answer but bow hi head and brood then a third
man philoetiu join them who wa bring in a barren heifer and
some goat these were brought over by the boatmen who ar there to
take peopl over when ani on come to them so philoetiu made hi
heifer and hi goat secur under the gatehous and then went up to
the swineherd who swineherd said he is thi stranger that is
late come here is he on of your men what is hi famili where doe
he come from poor fellow he look as if he had been some great man
but the god give sorrow to whom thei willeven to king if it so

as he spoke he went up to ulyss and salut him with hi right hand
good dai to you father stranger said he you seem to be veri
poorli off now but i hope you will have better time by and by father
jove of all god you ar the most malici we ar your own children
yet you show us no merci in all our miseri and afflict a sweat
came over me when i saw thi man and my ey fill with tear for he
remind me of ulyss who i fear is go about in just such rag as
thi man ar if inde he is still among the live if he is
alreadi dead and in the hous of hade then ala for my good master
who made me hi stockman when i wa quit young among the
cephallenian and now hi cattl ar countless no on could have done
better with them than i have for thei have bred like ear of corn
nevertheless i have to keep bring them in for other to eat who
take no heed to hi son though he is in the hous and fear not the
wrath of heaven but ar alreadi eager to divid ulyss properti
among them becaus he ha been awai so long i have often thoughtonli
it would not be right while hi son is livingof go off with the
cattl to some foreign countri bad as thi would be it is still
harder to stai here and be illtreat about other peopl herd my
posit is intoler and i should long sinc have run awai and put
myself under the protect of some other chief onli that i believ my
poor master will yet return and send all these suitor fly out of
the hous
stockman answer ulyss you seem to be a veri welldispos
person and i can see that you ar a man of sens therefor i will
tell you and will confirm my word with an oath by jove the chief of
all god and by that hearth of ulyss to which i am now come ulyss
shall return befor you leav thi place and if you ar so mind you
shall see him kill the suitor who ar now master here
if jove were to bring thi to pass repli the stockman you should
see how i would do my veri utmost to help him
and in like manner eumaeu prai that ulyss might return home
thu did thei convers meanwhil the suitor were hatch a plot to
murder telemachu but a bird flew near them on their left handan
eagl with a dove in it talon on thi amphinomu said my friend
thi plot of our to murder telemachu will not succe let us go to
dinner instead
the other assent so thei went insid and laid their cloak on the
bench and seat thei sacrif the sheep goat pig and the
heifer and when the inward meat were cook thei serv them round
thei mix the wine in the mixingbowl and the swineherd gave everi
man hi cup while philoetiu hand round the bread in the bread
basket and melanthiu pour them out their wine then thei laid
their hand upon the good thing that were befor them
telemachu purpos made ulyss sit in the part of the cloister that
wa pave with stone158 he gave him a shabbi look seat at a littl
tabl to himself and had hi portion of the inward meat brought to
him with hi wine in a gold cup sit there said he and drink your
wine among the great peopl i will put a stop to the gibe and blow
of the suitor for thi is no public hous but belong to ulyss
and ha pass from him to me therefor suitor keep your hand and
your tongu to yourselv or there will be mischief
the suitor bit their lip and marvel at the bold of hi
speech then antin said we do not like such languag but we will
put up with it for telemachu is threaten us in good earnest if
jove had let us we should have put a stop to hi brave talk er now
thu spoke antin but telemachu heed him not meanwhil the
herald were bring the holi hecatomb through the citi and the
achaean gather under the shadi grove of apollo
then thei roast the outer meat drew it off the spit gave everi man
hi portion and feast to their heart content those who wait at
tabl gave ulyss exactli the same portion as the other had for
telemachu had told them to do so
but minerva would not let the suitor for on moment drop their
insol for she want ulyss to becom still more bitter against
them now there happen to be among them a ribald fellow whose name
wa ctesippu and who came from same thi man confid in hi great
wealth wa pai court to the wife of ulyss and said to the
suitor hear what i have to sai the stranger ha alreadi had as
larg a portion as ani on els thi is well for it is not right nor
reason to illtreat ani guest of telemachu who come here i will
howev make him a present on my own account that he mai have
someth to give to the bathwoman or to some other of ulyss
servant
as he spoke he pick up a heifer foot from the meatbasket in which
it lai and threw it at ulyss but ulyss turn hi head a littl
asid and avoid it smile grimli sardinian fashion159 as he did
so and it hit the wall not him on thi telemachu spoke fierc to
ctesippu it is a good thing for you said he that the stranger
turn hi head so that you miss him if you had hit him i should
have run you through with my spear and your father would have had to
see about get you buri rather than marri in thi hous so let
me have no more unseemli behaviour from ani of you for i am grown up
now to the knowledg of good and evil and understand what is go on

return a sword and a spear and thi wa the begin of a fast
friendship although thei never visit at on anoth hous for

then given him by iphitu had not been taken with him by ulyss when
he sail for troi he had us it so long as he had been at home but
had left it behind as have been a keepsak from a valu friend
penelop present reach the oak threshold of the storeroom the
carpent had plane thi duli and had drawn a line on it so as to get

door she loos the strap from the handl of the door put in the
kei and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolt that held the
doors161 these flew open with a nois like a bull bellow in a
meadow and penelop step upon the rais platform where the chest
stood in which the fair linen and cloth were laid by along with
fragrant herb reach thenc she took down the bow with it bow
case from the peg on which it hung she sat down with it on her knee
weep bitterli as she took the bow out of it case and when her
tear had reliev her she went to the cloister where the suitor

contain much iron and bronz which her husband had won as prize
when she reach the suitor she stood by on of the bearingpost
support the roof of the cloister hold a veil befor her face
and with a maid on either side of her then she said
listen to me you suitor who persist in abus the hospit of

pretext than that you want to marri me thi then be the prize
that you ar contend for i will bring out the mighti bow of

arrow through each on of twelv ax him will i follow and quit thi
hous of my law husband so goodli and so abound in wealth but
even so i doubt not that i shall rememb it in my dream
as she spoke she told eumaeu to set the bow and the piec of iron
befor the suitor and eumaeu wept as he took them to do as she had
bidden him hard by the stockman wept also when he saw hi master
bow but antin scold them you countri lout said he silli
simpleton why should you add to the sorrow of your mistress by
cry in thi wai she ha enough to griev her in the loss of her
husband sit still therefor and eat your dinner in silenc or go
outsid if you want to cry and leav the bow behind you we suitor
shall have to contend for it with might and main for we shall find it
no light matter to string such a bow as thi is there is not a man of
us all who is such anoth as ulyss for i have seen him and rememb
him though i wa then onli a child
thi wa what he said but all the time he wa expect to be abl to
string the bow and shoot through the iron wherea in fact he wa to be
the first that should tast of the arrow from the hand of ulyss
whom he wa dishonour in hi own houseeg the other on to do so
also
then telemachu spoke great heaven he exclaim jove must have
rob me of my sens here is my dear and excel mother sai she
will quit thi hous and marri again yet i am laugh and enjoi
myself as though there were noth happen but suitor as the
contest ha been agre upon let it go forward it is for a woman
whose peer is not to be found in pylo argo or mycen nor yet in
ithaca nor on the mainland you know thi as well as i do what need
have i to speak in prais of my mother come on then make no excus
for delai but let us see whether you can string the bow or no i too
will make trial of it for if i can string it and shoot through the
iron i shall not suffer my mother to quit thi hous with a stranger
not if i can win the prize which my father won befor me
as he spoke he sprang from hi seat threw hi crimson cloak from him
and took hi sword from hi shoulder first he set the ax in a row
in a long groov which he had dug for them and had made straight by
line162 then he stamp the earth tight round them and everyon wa
surpris when thei saw him set them up so orderli though he had never
seen anyth of the kind befor thi done he went on to the pavement
to make trial of the bow thrice did he tug at it try with all hi
might to draw the string and thrice he had to leav off though he had
hope to string the bow and shoot through the iron he wa try for
the fourth time and would have strung it had not ulyss made a sign
to check him in spite of all hi eager so he said
ala i shall either be alwai feebl and of no prowess or i am too
young and have not yet reach my full strength so as to be abl to
hold my own if ani on attack me you other therefor who ar
stronger than i make trial of the bow and get thi contest settl
on thi he put the bow down let it lean against the door that led
into the hous with the arrow stand against the top of the bow
then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen and antin
said
come on each of you in hi turn go toward the right from the
place at which the cupbear begin when he is hand round the wine
the rest agre and leiod son of oenop wa the first to rise he
wa sacrifici priest to the suitor and sat in the corner near the
mixingbowl 163 he wa the onli man who hate their evil deed and wa
indign with the other he wa now the first to take the bow and
arrow so he went on to the pavement to make hi trial but he could
not string the bow for hi hand were weak and unus to hard work
thei therefor soon grew tire and he said to the suitor my
friend i cannot string it let anoth have it thi bow shall take
the life and soul out of mani a chief among us for it is better to die
than to live after have miss the prize that we have so long striven
for and which ha brought us so long togeth some on of us is even
now hope and prai that he mai marri penelop but when he ha seen
thi bow and tri it let him woo and make bridal offer to some
other woman and let penelop marri whoever make her the best offer
and whose lot it is to win her
on thi he put the bow down let it lean against the door164 with
the arrow stand against the tip of the bow then he took hi seat
again on the seat from which he had risen and antin rebuk him
sai
leiod what ar you talk about your word ar monstrou and
intoler it make me angri to listen to you shall then thi bow
take the life of mani a chief among us mere becaus you cannot bend
it yourself true you were not born to be an archer but there ar
other who will soon string it
then he said to melanthiu the goatherd look sharp light a fire in
the court and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it bring us
also a larg ball of lard from what thei have in the hous let us
warm the bow and greas itw will then make trial of it again and
bring the contest to an end
melanthiu lit the fire and set a seat cover with sheep skin besid
it he also brought a great ball of lard from what thei had in the
hous and the suitor warm the bow and again made trial of it but
thei were none of them nearli strong enough to string it nevertheless
there still remain antin and eurymachu who were the ringlead
among the suitor and much the foremost among them all
then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloister togeth and
ulyss follow them when thei had got outsid the gate and the
outer yard ulyss said to them quietli
stockman and you swineherd i have someth in my mind which i am in
doubt whether to sai or no but i think i will sai it what manner of
men would you be to stand by ulyss if some god should bring him back
here all of a sudden sai which you ar dispos to doto side with the
suitor or with ulyss
father jove answer the stockman would inde that you might so
ordain it if some god were but to bring ulyss back you should see
with what might and main i would fight for him
in like word eumaeu prai to all the god that ulyss might return
when therefor he saw for certain what mind thei were of ulyss
said it is i ulyss who am here i have suffer much but at
last in the twentieth year i am come back to my own countri i find
that you two alon of all my servant ar glad that i should do so for
i have not heard ani of the other prai for my return to you two
therefor will i unfold the truth as it shall be if heaven shall
deliv the suitor into my hand i will find wive for both of you
will give you hous and hold close to my own and you shall be to me
as though you were brother and friend of telemachu i will now give
you convinc proof that you mai know me and be assur see here is
the scar from the boar tooth that rip me when i wa out hunt on
mt parnassu with the son of autolycu
as he spoke he drew hi rag asid from the great scar and when thei
had examin it thoroughli thei both of them wept about ulyss threw
their arm round him and kiss hi head and shoulder while ulyss
kiss their hand and face in return the sun would have gone down
upon their mourn if ulyss had not check them and said
ceas your weep lest some on should come outsid and see us and
tell those who ar within when you go in do so separ not both
togeth i will go first and do you follow afterward let thi
moreov be the token between us the suitor will all of them try to
prevent me from get hold of the bow and quiver do you therefor
eumaeu place it in my hand when you ar carri it about and tell
the women to close the door of their apart if thei hear ani
groan or uproar as of men fight about the hous thei must not
come out thei must keep quiet and stai where thei ar at their work
and i charg you philoetiu to make fast the door of the outer
court and to bind them secur at onc
when he had thu spoken he went back to the hous and took the seat
that he had left present hi two servant follow him insid
at thi moment the bow wa in the hand of eurymachu who wa warm
it by the fire but even so he could not string it and he wa greatli
griev he heav a deep sigh and said i griev for myself and for
us all i griev that i shall have to forgo the marriag but i do not
care nearli so much about thi for there ar plenti of other women in
ithaca and elsewher what i feel most is the fact of our be so
inferior to ulyss in strength that we cannot string hi bow thi
will disgrac us in the ey of those who ar yet unborn
it shall not be so eurymachu said antin and you know it
yourself todai is the feast of apollo throughout all the land who can
string a bow on such a dai as thi put it on on sidea for the ax
thei can stai where thei ar for no on is like to come to the hous
and take them awai let the cupbear go round with hi cup that we
mai make our drinkoff and drop thi matter of the bow we will
tell melanthiu to bring us in some goat tomorrowth best he ha we
can then offer thigh bone to apollo the mighti archer and again make
trial of the bow so as to bring the contest to an end
the rest approv hi word and thereon men servant pour water over
the hand of the guest while page fill the mixingbowl with wine
and water and hand it round after give everi man hi
drinkoff then when thei had made their offer and had drunk
each as much as he desir ulyss craftili said
suitor of the illustri queen listen that i mai speak even as i am
mind i appeal more especi to eurymachu and to antin who ha
just spoken with so much reason ceas shoot for the present and
leav the matter to the god but in the morn let heaven give
victori to whom it will for the moment howev give me the bow that
i mai prove the power of my hand among you all and see whether i
still have as much strength as i us to have or whether travel and
neglect have made an end of it
thi made them all veri angri for thei fear he might string the bow
antin therefor rebuk him fierc sai wretch creatur you
have not so much as a grain of sens in your whole bodi you ought to
think yourself lucki in be allow to dine unharm among your
better without have ani smaller portion serv you than we other
have had and in be allow to hear our convers no other
beggar or stranger ha been allow to hear what we sai among
ourselv the wine must have been do you a mischief as it doe
with all those who drink immoder it wa wine that inflam the
centaur euryt when he wa stai with peirith among the
lapitha when the wine had got into hi head he went mad and did ill
deed about the hous of peirith thi anger the hero who were
there assembl so thei rush at him and cut off hi ear and
nostril then thei drag him through the doorwai out of the hous
so he went awai craze and bore the burden of hi crime bereft of
understand henceforth therefor there wa war between mankind and
the centaur but he brought it upon himself through hi own
drunken in like manner i can tell you that it will go hardli with
you if you string the bow you will find no merci from ani on here
for we shall at onc ship you off to king echetu who kill everi on
that come near him you will never get awai aliv so drink and keep
quiet without get into a quarrel with men younger than yourself
penelop then spoke to him antin said she it is not right that
you should illtreat ani guest of telemachu who come to thi hous
if the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighti bow of
ulyss can you suppos that he would take me home with him and make
me hi wife even the man himself can have no such idea in hi mind
none of you need let that disturb hi feast it would be out of all
reason
queen penelop answer eurymachu we do not suppos that thi man
will take you awai with him it is imposs but we ar afraid lest
some of the baser sort men or women among the achaean should go
gossip about and sai these suitor ar a feebl folk thei ar
pai court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not on of them wa
abl to string and yet a beggarli tramp who came to the hous strung
it at onc and sent an arrow through the iron thi is what will be
said and it will be a scandal against us
eurymachu penelop answer peopl who persist in eat up the
estat of a great chieftain and dishonour hi hous must not expect
other to think well of them why then should you mind if men talk as
you think thei will thi stranger is strong and wellbuilt he sai
moreov that he is of nobl birth give him the bow and let us see
whether he can string it or no i sayand it shall sure bethat if
apollo vouchsaf him the glori of string it i will give him a
cloak and shirt of good wear with a javelin to keep off dog and
robber and a sharp sword i will also give him sandal and will see
him sent safe wherev he want to go
then telemachu said mother i am the onli man either in ithaca or in
the island that ar over against eli who ha the right to let ani on
have the bow or to refus it no on shall forc me on wai or the
other not even though i choos to make the stranger a present of the
bow outright and let him take it awai with him go then within the
hous and busi yourself with your daili duti your loom your
distaff and the order of your servant thi bow is a man matter
and mine abov all other for it is i who am master here
she went wonder back into the hous and laid her son sai in
her heart then go upstair with her handmaid into her room she
mourn her dear husband till minerva sent sweet sleep over her
eyelid
the swineherd now took up the bow and wa for take it to ulyss but
the suitor clamour at him from all part of the cloister and on
of them said you idiot where ar you take the bow to ar you out
of your wit if apollo and the other god will grant our prayer your
own boarhound shall get you into some quiet littl place and worri
you to death
eumaeu wa frighten at the outcri thei all rais so he put the bow
down then and there but telemachu shout out at him from the other
side of the cloister and threaten him sai father eumaeu
bring the bow on in spite of them or young as i am i will pelt you
with stone back to the countri for i am the better man of the two i
wish i wa as much stronger than all the other suitor in the hous as
i am than you i would soon send some of them off sick and sorri for
thei mean mischief
thu did he speak and thei all of them laugh heartili which put
them in a better humour with telemachu so eumaeu brought the bow on
and place it in the hand of ulyss when he had done thi he call
euryclea apart and said to her euryclea telemachu sai you ar to
close the door of the women apart if thei hear ani groan or
uproar as of men fight about the hous thei ar not to come out
but ar to keep quiet and stai where thei ar at their work
euryclea did as she wa told and close the door of the women
apart
meanwhil philoetiu slip quietli out and made fast the gate of the
outer court there wa a ship cabl of byblu fibr ly in the
gatehous so he made the gate fast with it and then came in again
resum the seat that he had left and keep an ey on ulyss who
had now got the bow in hi hand and wa turn it everi wai about
and prove it all over to see whether the worm had been eat into
it two horn dure hi absenc then would on turn toward hi
neighbour sai thi is some tricki old bowfanci either he ha
got on like it at home or he want to make on in such workmanlik
style doe the old vagabond handl it
anoth said i hope he mai be no more success in other thing than
he is like to be in string thi bow
but ulyss when he had taken it up and examin it all over strung
it as easili as a skill bard string a new peg of hi lyre and make
the twist gut fast at both end then he took it in hi right hand to
prove the string and it sang sweetli under hi touch like the
twitter of a swallow the suitor were dismai and turn colour
as thei heard it at that moment moreov jove thunder loudli as a
sign and the heart of ulyss rejoic as he heard the omen that the
son of scheme saturn had sent him
he took an arrow that wa ly upon the table165for those which the
achaean were so shortli about to tast were all insid the quiverh
laid it on the centrepiec of the bow and drew the notch of the arrow
and the string toward him still seat on hi seat when he had taken
aim he let fly and hi arrow pierc everi on of the handlehol of
the ax from the first onward till it had gone right through them
and into the outer courtyard then he said to telemachu
your guest ha not disgrac you telemachu i did not miss what i
aim at and i wa not long in string my bow i am still strong
and not as the suitor twit me with be now howev it is time for
the achaean to prepar supper while there is still daylight and then
otherwis to disport themselv with song and danc which ar the
crown ornament of a banquet
as he spoke he made a sign with hi eyebrow and telemachu gird on
hi sword grasp hi spear and stood arm besid hi father seat
book xxii
the kill of the suitorsth maid who have misconduct themselv
ar made to cleans the cloister and ar then hang
then ulyss tore off hi rag and sprang on to the broad pavement
with hi bow and hi quiver full of arrow he shed the arrow on to
the ground at hi feet and said the mighti contest is at an end i
will now see whether apollo will vouchsaf it to me to hit anoth mark
which no man ha yet hit
on thi he aim a deadli arrow at antin who wa about to take up a
twohandl gold cup to drink hi wine and alreadi had it in hi hand
he had no thought of deathwho amongst all the revel would think
that on man howev brave would stand alon among so mani and kill
him the arrow struck antin in the throat and the point went clean
through hi neck so that he fell over and the cup drop from hi
hand while a thick stream of blood gush from hi nostril he kick
the tabl from him and upset the thing on it so that the bread and
roast meat were all soil as thei fell over on to the ground166
the suitor were in an uproar when thei saw that a man had been hit
thei sprang in dismai on and all of them from their seat and look
everywher toward the wall but there wa neither shield nor spear
and thei rebuk ulyss veri angrili stranger said thei you
shall pai for shoot peopl in thi wai you shall see no other
contest you ar a doom man he whom you have slain wa the foremost
youth in ithaca and the vultur shall devour you for have kill

thu thei spoke for thei thought that he had kill antin by
mistak and did not perceiv that death wa hang over the head of
everi on of them but ulyss glare at them and said
dog did you think that i should not come back from troi you have
wast my substance167 have forc my women servant to lie with you
and have woo my wife while i wa still live you have fear
neither god nor man and now you shall die
thei turn pale with fear as he spoke and everi man look round
about to see whither he might fly for safeti but eurymachu alon
spoke
if you ar ulyss said he then what you have said is just we
have done much wrong on your land and in your hous but antin who
wa the head and front of the offend li low alreadi it wa all
hi do it wa not that he want to marri penelop he did not so

and drunk each on of us shall pai you a fine worth twenti oxen and
we will keep on give you gold and bronz till your heart is soften
until we have done thi no on can complain of your be enrag

ulyss again glare at him and said though you should give me all
that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have i
will not stai my hand till i have paid all of you in full you must
fight or fly for your live and fly not a man of you shall
their heart sank as thei heard him but eurymachu again spoke sai

show fight draw your sword and hold up the tabl to shield you from
hi arrow let us have at him with a rush to drive him from the
pavement and doorwai we can then get through into the town and rais
such an alarm as shall soon stai hi shoot
as he spoke he drew hi keen blade of bronz sharpen on both side
and with a loud cry sprang toward ulyss but ulyss instantli shot
an arrow into hi breast that caught him by the nippl and fix itself
in hi liver he drop hi sword and fell doubl up over hi tabl
the cup and all the meat went over on to the ground as he smote the
earth with hi forehead in the agoni of death and he kick the
stool with hi feet until hi ey were close in dark
then amphinomu drew hi sword and made straight at ulyss to try and
get him awai from the door but telemachu wa too quick for him and
struck him from behind the spear caught him between the shoulder and
went right through hi chest so that he fell heavili to the ground and
struck the earth with hi forehead then telemachu sprang awai from
him leav hi spear still in the bodi for he fear that if he
stai to draw it out some on of the achaean might come up and hack
at him with hi sword or knock him down so he set off at a run and
immedi wa at hi father side then he said

your templ i will arm myself as well and will bring other armour
for the swineherd and the stockman for we had better be arm

telemachu did as hi father said and went off to the store room where
the armour wa kept he chose four shield eight spear and four
brass helmet with horsehair plume he brought them with all speed to

swineherd also put on their armour and took their place near ulyss
meanwhil ulyss as long as hi arrow last had been shoot the

time but agelau shout out cannot some on go up to the trap door
and tell the peopl what is go on help would come at onc and we
should soon make an end of thi man and hi shoot

thu did he speak and thei did even as he had said thei went to the
store room which thei enter befor melanthiu saw them for he wa
busi search for arm in the innermost part of the room so the two
took their stand on either side of the door and wait by and by

pass the night on a soft bed as you deserv you will know veri well
when morn come from the stream of oceanu and it is time for you

there then thei left him in veri cruel bondag and have put on
their armour thei close the door behind them and went back to take
their place by the side of ulyss whereon the four men stood in the
cloister fierc and full of furi nevertheless those who were in the
bodi of the court were still both brave and mani then jove daughter
minerva came up to them have assum the voic and form of mentor
ulyss wa glad when he saw her and said mentor lend me your help
and forget not your old comrad nor the mani good turn he ha done
you besid you ar my agem
but all the time he felt sure it wa minerva and the suitor from the
other side rais an uproar when thei saw her agelau wa the first to
reproach her mentor he cri do not let ulyss beguil you into
side with him and fight the suitor thi is what we will do when
we have kill these peopl father and son we will kill you too you
shall pai for it with your head and when we have kill you we will
take all you have in door or out and bring it into hotchpot with
ulyss properti we will not let your son live in your hous nor
your daughter nor shall your widow continu to live in the citi of
ithaca
thi made minerva still more furiou so she scold ulyss veri
angrily173 ulyss said she your strength and prowess ar no
longer what thei were when you fought for nine long year among the
trojan about the nobl ladi helen you kill mani a man in those
dai and it wa through your stratagem that priam citi wa taken
how come it that you ar so lament less valiant now that you ar
on your own ground face to face with the suitor in your own hous
come on my good fellow stand by my side and see how mentor son of
alcimu shall fight your foe and requit your kind confer
upon him
but she would not give him full victori as yet for she wish still
further to prove hi own prowess and that of hi brave son so she flew
up to on of the rafter in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in
the form of a swallow
meanwhil agelau son of damastor eurynomu amphimedon demoptolemu
pisand and polybu son of polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon
the suitor side of all those who were still fight for their live
thei were by far the most valiant for the other had alreadi fallen
under the arrow of ulyss agelau shout to them and said my
friend he will soon have to leav off for mentor ha gone awai after
have done noth for him but brag thei ar stand at the door
unsupport do not aim at him all at onc but six of you throw your
spear first and see if you cannot cover yourselv with glori by
kill him when he ha fallen we need not be uneasi about the
other
thei threw their spear as he bade them but minerva made them all of
no effect on hit the door post anoth went against the door the
point shaft of anoth struck the wall and as soon as thei had
avoid all the spear of the suitor ulyss said to hi own men my
friend i should sai we too had better let drive into the middl of
them or thei will crown all the harm thei have done us by kill us
outright
thei therefor aim straight in front of them and threw their spear
ulyss kill demoptolemu telemachu euryad eumaeu elatu while
the stockman kill pisand these all bit the dust and as the other
drew back into a corner ulyss and hi men rush forward and regain
their spear by draw them from the bodi of the dead
the suitor now aim a second time but again minerva made their
weapon for the most part without effect on hit a bearingpost of the
cloister anoth went against the door while the point shaft of
anoth struck the wall still amphimedon just took a piec of the top
skin from off telemachuss wrist and ctesippu manag to graze
eumaeuss shoulder abov hi shield but the spear went on and fell to
the ground then ulyss and hi men let drive into the crowd of
suitor ulyss hit eurydama telemachu amphimedon and eumaeu
polybu after thi the stockman hit ctesippu in the breast and
taunt him sai foulmouth son of polythers do not be so
foolish as to talk wickedli anoth time but let heaven direct your
speech for the god ar far stronger than men i make you a present of
thi advic to repai you for the foot which you gave ulyss when he
wa beg about in hi own hous
thu spoke the stockman and ulyss struck the son of damastor with a
spear in close fight while telemachu hit leocritu son of evenor in
the belli and the dart went clean through him so that he fell forward
full on hi face upon the ground then minerva from her seat on the
rafter held up her deadli aegi and the heart of the suitor quail
thei fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattl madden
by the gadfli in earli summer when the dai ar at their longest as
eaglebeak crooktalon vultur from the mountain swoop down on
the smaller bird that cower in flock upon the ground and kill them
for thei cannot either fight or fly and looker on enjoi the
sporteven so did ulyss and hi men fall upon the suitor and smite
them on everi side thei made a horribl groan as their brain were
be batter in and the ground seeth with their blood
leiod then caught the knee of ulyss and said ulyss i beseech
you have merci upon me and spare me i never wrong ani of the women
in your hous either in word or deed and i tri to stop the other i
saw them but thei would not listen and now thei ar pai for their
folli i wa their sacrif priest if you kill me i shall die
without have done anyth to deserv it and shall have got no
thank for all the good that i did
ulyss look sternli at him and answer if you were their
sacrif priest you must have prai mani a time that it might be
long befor i got home again and that you might marri my wife and have
children by her therefor you shall die
with these word he pick up the sword that agelau had drop when
he wa be kill and which wa ly upon the ground then he
struck leiod on the back of hi neck so that hi head fell roll
in the dust while he wa yet speak
the minstrel phemiu son of terpesh who had been forc by the
suitor to sing to themnow tri to save hi life he wa stand
near toward the trap door174 and held hi lyre in hi hand he did
not know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar
of jove that wa in the outer court and on which both laert and
ulyss had offer up the thigh bone of mani an ox or whether to go
straight up to ulyss and embrac hi knee but in the end he deem
it best to embrac ulyss knee so he laid hi lyre on the ground
between the mix bowl 175 and the silverstud seat then go up
to ulyss he caught hold of hi knee and said ulyss i beseech
you have merci on me and spare me you will be sorri for it afterward
if you kill a bard who can sing both for god and men as i can i make
all my lai myself and heaven visit me with everi kind of
inspir i would sing to you as though you were a god do not
therefor be in such a hurri to cut my head off your own son
telemachu will tell you that i did not want to frequent your hous and
sing to the suitor after their meal but thei were too mani and too
strong for me so thei made me
telemachu heard him and at onc went up to hi father hold he
cri the man is guiltless do him no hurt and we will spare medon
too who wa alwai good to me when i wa a boi unless philoetiu or
eumaeu ha alreadi kill him or he ha fallen in your wai when you
were rage about the court
medon caught these word of telemachu for he wa crouch under a
seat beneath which he had hidden by cover himself up with a freshli
flai heifer hide so he threw off the hide went up to telemachu
and laid hold of hi knee
here i am my dear sir said he stai your hand therefor and tell
your father or he will kill me in hi rage against the suitor for
have wast hi substanc and been so foolishli disrespect to
yourself
ulyss smile at him and answer fear not telemachu ha save
your life that you mai know in futur and tell other peopl how
greatli better good deed prosper than evil on go therefor
outsid the cloister into the outer court and be out of the wai of
the slaughtery and the bardwhil i finish my work here insid
the pair went into the outer court as fast as thei could and sat down
by jove great altar look fearfulli round and still expect
that thei would be kill then ulyss search the whole court
carefulli over to see if anyon had manag to hide himself and wa
still live but he found them all ly in the dust and welter in
their blood thei were like fish which fishermen have net out of
the sea and thrown upon the beach to lie gasp for water till the
heat of the sun make an end of them even so were the suitor ly
all huddl up on against the other
then ulyss said to telemachu call nurs euryclea i have someth
to sai to her
telemachu went and knock at the door of the women room make
hast said he you old woman who have been set over all the other
women in the hous come outsid my father wish to speak to you
when euryclea heard thi she unfasten the door of the women room
and came out follow telemachu she found ulyss among the corps
bespatt with blood and filth like a lion that ha just been
devour an ox and hi breast and both hi cheek ar all bloodi so
that he is a fear sight even so wa ulyss besmirch from head to
foot with gore when she saw all the corps and such a quantiti of
blood she wa begin to cry out for joi for she saw that a great
deed had been done but ulyss check her old woman said he
rejoic in silenc restrain yourself and do not make ani nois about
it it is an unholi thing to vaunt over dead men heaven doom and
their own evil deed have brought these men to destruct for thei
respect no man in the whole world neither rich nor poor who came
near them and thei have come to a bad end as a punish for their
wicked and folli now howev tell me which of the women in the
hous have misconduct themselv and who ar innocent176
i will tell you the truth my son answer euryclea there ar
fifti women in the hous whom we teach to do thing such as card
wool and all kind of household work of these twelv in all177 have
misbehav and have been want in respect to me and also to
penelop thei show no disrespect to telemachu for he ha onli
late grown and hi mother never permit him to give order to the
femal servant but let me go upstair and tell your wife all that ha
happen for some god ha been send her to sleep
do not wake her yet answer ulyss but tell the women who have
misconduct themselv to come to me
euryclea left the cloister to tell the women and make them come to
ulyss in the meantim he call telemachu the stockman and the
swineherd begin said he to remov the dead and make the women
help you then get spong and clean water to swill down the tabl
and seat when you have thoroughli cleans the whole cloister take
the women into the space between the dome room and the wall of the
outer court and run them through with your sword till thei ar quit
dead and have forgotten all about love and the wai in which thei us

on thi the women came down in a bodi weep and wail bitterli
first thei carri the dead bodi out and prop them up against on
anoth in the gatehous ulyss order them about and made them do
their work quickli so thei had to carri the bodi out when thei had
done thi thei clean all the tabl and seat with spong and
water while telemachu and the two other shovel up the blood and
dirt from the ground and the women carri it all awai and put it out
of door then when thei had made the whole place quit clean and
orderli thei took the women out and hem them in the narrow space
between the wall of the dome room and that of the yard so that thei
could not get awai and telemachu said to the other two i shall not
let these women die a clean death for thei were insol to me and my
mother and us to sleep with the suitor
so sai he made a ship cabl fast to on of the bearingpost that
support the roof of the dome room and secur it all around the
build at a good height lest ani of the women feet should touch
the ground and as thrush or dove beat against a net that ha been
set for them in a thicket just as thei were get to their nest and
a terribl fate await them even so did the women have to put their
head in noos on after the other and die most miserably178 their

as for melanthiu thei took him through the cloister into the inner
court there thei cut off hi nose and hi ear thei drew out hi
vital and gave them to the dog raw and then in their furi thei cut

fathom the counsel of the god nevertheless we will go in search of
my son that i mai see the corps of the suitor and the man who ha

on thi she came down from her upper room and while do so she
consid whether she should keep at a distanc from her husband and
question him or whether she should at onc go up to him and embrac
him when howev she had cross the stone floor of the cloister
she sat down opposit ulyss by the fire against the wall at right
angles180 to that by which she had enter while ulyss sat near
on of the bearingpost look upon the ground and wait to see
what hi brave wife would sai to him when she saw him for a long time
she sat silent and as on lost in amaz at on moment she look
him full in the face but then again directli she wa misl by hi
shabbi cloth and fail to recognis him181 till telemachu began to
reproach her and said
motherbut you ar so hard that i cannot call you by such a namewhi
do you keep awai from my father in thi wai why do you not sit by hi
side and begin talk to him and ask him question no other woman
could bear to keep awai from her husband when he had come back to her
after twenti year of absenc and after have gone through so much
but your heart alwai wa as hard as a stone
penelop answer my son i am so lost in astonish that i can
find no word in which either to ask question or to answer them i
cannot even look him straight in the face still if he realli is
ulyss come back to hi own home again we shall get to understand on
anoth better by and by for there ar token with which we two ar
alon acquaint and which ar hidden from all other
ulyss smile at thi and said to telemachu let your mother put me
to ani proof she like she will make up her mind about it present
she reject me for the moment and believ me to be somebodi els
becaus i am cover with dirt and have such bad cloth on let us
howev consid what we had better do next when on man ha kill
anothereven though he wa not on who would leav mani friend to take
up hi quarrelth man who ha kill him must still sai good bye to
hi friend and fly the countri wherea we have been kill the stai
of a whole town and all the pick youth of ithaca i would have you
consid thi matter
look to it yourself father answer telemachu for thei sai you
ar the wisest counsellor in the world and that there is no other
mortal man who can compar with you we will follow you with right good
will nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength hold
out
i will sai what i think will be best answer ulyss first wash
and put your shirt on tell the maid also to go to their own room and
dress phemiu shall then strike up a danc tune on hi lyre so that
if peopl outsid hear or ani of the neighbour or some on go
along the street happen to notic it thei mai think there is a
wed in the hous and no rumour about the death of the suitor
will get about in the town befor we can escap to the wood upon my
own land onc there we will settl which of the cours heaven
vouchsaf us shall seem wisest
thu did he speak and thei did even as he had said first thei wash
and put their shirt on while the women got readi then phemiu took
hi lyre and set them all long for sweet song and state danc the
hous reecho with the sound of men and women danc and the peopl
outsid said i suppos the queen ha been get marri at last
she ought to be asham of herself for not continu to protect her
husband properti until he come home182
thi wa what thei said but thei did not know what it wa that had
been happen the upper servant eurynom wash and anoint ulyss
in hi own hous and gave him a shirt and cloak while minerva made him
look taller and stronger than befor she also made the hair grow thick
on the top of hi head and flow down in curl like hyacinth blossom
she glorifi him about the head and shoulder just as a skil
workman who ha studi art of all kind under vulcan or minervaand
hi work is full of beautyenrich a piec of silver plate by gild
it he came from the bath look like on of the immort and sat
down opposit hi wife on the seat he had left my dear said he
heaven ha endow you with a heart more unyield than woman ever
yet had no other woman could bear to keep awai from her husband when
he had come back to her after twenti year of absenc and after have
gone through so much but come nurs get a bed readi for me i will
sleep alon for thi woman ha a heart as hard as iron
my dear answer penelop i have no wish to set myself up nor to
depreci you but i am not struck by your appear for i veri well
rememb what kind of a man you were when you set sail from ithaca
nevertheless euryclea take hi bed outsid the bed chamber that he
himself built bring the bed outsid thi room and put bed upon it
with fleec good coverlet and blanket
she said thi to try him but ulyss wa veri angri and said wife i
am much displeas at what you have just been sai who ha been
take my bed from the place in which i left it he must have found it
a hard task no matter how skill a workman he wa unless some god
came and help him to shift it there is no man live howev strong
and in hi prime who could move it from it place for it is a
marvel curios which i made with my veri own hand there wa a
young oliv grow within the precinct of the hous in full vigour
and about as thick as a bearingpost i built my room round thi with
strong wall of stone and a roof to cover them and i made the door
strong and wellfit then i cut off the top bough of the oliv
tree and left the stump stand thi i dress roughli from the root
upward and then work with carpent tool well and skilfulli
straighten my work by draw a line on the wood and make it into
a bedprop i then bore a hole down the middl and made it the
centrepost of my bed at which i work till i had finish it
inlai it with gold and silver after thi i stretch a hide of
crimson leather from on side of it to the other so you see i know all
about it and i desir to learn whether it is still there or whether
ani on ha been remov it by cut down the oliv tree at it
root
when she heard the sure proof ulyss now gave her she fairli broke
down she flew weep to hi side flung her arm about hi neck and
kiss him do not be angri with me ulyss she cri you who ar
the wisest of mankind we have suffer both of us heaven ha deni
us the happi of spend our youth and of grow old togeth
do not then be aggriev or take it amiss that i did not embrac you
thu as soon as i saw you i have been shudder all the time through
fear that someon might come here and deceiv me with a ly stori
for there ar mani veri wick peopl go about jove daughter
helen would never have yield herself to a man from a foreign countri
if she had known that the son of achaean would come after her and
bring her back heaven put it in her heart to do wrong and she gave no
thought to that sin which ha been the sourc of all our sorrow now
howev that you have convinc me by show that you know all about
our bed which no human be ha ever seen but you and i and a singl
maidserv the daughter of actor who wa given me by my father on my
marriag and who keep the door of our room hard of belief though i
have been i can mistrust no longer
then ulyss in hi turn melt and wept as he clasp hi dear and
faith wife to hi bosom as the sight of land is welcom to men who
ar swim toward the shore when neptun ha wreck their ship
with the furi of hi wind and wave a few alon reach the land and
these cover with brine ar thank when thei find themselv on
firm ground and out of dangereven so wa her husband welcom to her as
she look upon him and she could not tear her two fair arm from
about hi neck inde thei would have gone on indulg their sorrow
till rosyfing morn appear had not minerva determin otherwis
and held night back in the far west while she would not suffer dawn to
leav oceanu nor to yoke the two steed lampu and phaethon that bear
her onward to break the dai upon mankind
at last howev ulyss said wife we have not yet reach the end
of our troubl i have an unknown amount of toil still to undergo it
is long and difficult but i must go through with it for thu the
shade of teiresia prophesi concern me on the dai when i went
down into hade to ask about my return and that of my companion but
now let us go to bed that we mai lie down and enjoi the bless boon
of sleep
you shall go to bed as soon as you pleas repli penelop now
that the god have sent you home to your own good hous and to your
countri but as heaven ha put it in your mind to speak of it tell me
about the task that li befor you i shall have to hear about it
later so it is better that i should be told at onc
my dear answer ulyss why should you press me to tell you
still i will not conceal it from you though you will not like it i
do not like it myself for teiresia bade me travel far and wide
carri an oar till i came to a countri where the peopl have never
heard of the sea and do not even mix salt with their food thei know
noth about ship nor oar that ar as the wing of a ship he gave
me thi certain token which i will not hide from you he said that a
wayfar should meet me and ask me whether it wa a winnow shovel
that i had on my shoulder on thi i wa to fix my oar in the ground
and sacrific a ram a bull and a boar to neptun after which i wa
to go home and offer hecatomb to all the god in heaven on after the
other as for myself he said that death should come to me from the
sea and that my life should ebb awai veri gentli when i wa full of
year and peac of mind and my peopl should bless me all thi he
said should sure come to pass
and penelop said if the god ar go to vouchsaf you a happier
time in your old ag you mai hope then to have some respit from
misfortun
thu did thei convers meanwhil eurynom and the nurs took torch
and made the bed readi with soft coverlet as soon as thei had laid
them the nurs went back into the hous to go to her rest leav the
bed chamber woman eurynome183 to show ulyss and penelop to bed by
torch light when she had conduct them to their room she went back
and thei then came joyfulli to the rite of their own old bed
telemachu philoetiu and the swineherd now left off danc and
made the women leav off also thei then laid themselv down to sleep
in the cloister
when ulyss and penelop had had their fill of love thei fell talk
with on anoth she told him how much she had had to bear in see

when the will of aegisbear jove inspir him he and telemachu
took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber bolt the door

quantiti of iron to be contend for by us illfat suitor and thi
wa the begin of our end for not on of us could string the
bownor nearli do so when it wa about to reach the hand of ulyss
we all of us shout out that it should not be given him no matter

11 the whole open court with the cover cloister
run round it wa call or but the cover part
wa distinguish by be call shadi or shadowgiv it wa in
thi part that the tabl for the suitor were laid the fountain court
at hampton court mai serv as an illustr save as regard the us
of arch instead of wooden support and rafter and the arrang
is still common in sicili the usual translat shadowi or duski
hall give a fals idea of the scene
12 the reader will note the extrem care which the writer take to
make it clear that none of the suitor were allow to sleep in
ulyss hous
13 see appendix g in plan of ulyss hous
14 i imagin thi passag to be a rejoind to il xxiii 702705
in which a tripod is valu at twelv oxen and a good us maid of
all work at onli four the scrupul regard of laert for hi wife
feel is of a piec with the extrem jealousi for the honour of
woman which is manifest throughout the odyssei
15 the or tunica wa a shirt or shift and serv

women smith dictionari of greek and roman antiqu under

be seen in the older hous at trapani there is a slot on the outer
side of the door by mean of which a person who ha left the room can
shoot the bolt my bedroom at the albergo central wa fasten in thi
wai
17 so we vulgarli sai had cook hi
goos or had settl hi hash gyptiu cannot of cours know of
the fate antiphu had met with for there had as yet been no new of or
from ulyss
18 il xxii 416 the
authoress ha bungl by borrow these word verbatim from the
iliad without prefix the necessari do not which i have
suppli
19 ie you have monei and could pai when i got judgment wherea
the suitor ar men of straw
20 cf il ii 76
the odyssean passag run
is it possibl not to suspect that the name mentor wa coin upon that
of nestor
21 ie in the outer court and in the uncov part of the inner
hous
22 thi would be fair from sicili which wa do duti for ithaca
in the mind of the writer but a north wind would have been prefer
for a voyag from the real ithaca to pylo
23 the wind doe not whistl over
wave it onli whistl through rig or some other obstacl that
cut it
24 cf il v20 the
odyssean line is there can
be no doubt that the odyssean line wa suggest by the iliad but
noth can explain why idu jump from hi chariot should suggest
to the writer of the odyssei the sun jump from the sea the
probabl is that she never gave the matter a thought but took the
line in question as an effect of satur with the iliad and of
unconsci cerebr the odyssei contain mani such exampl
25 the heart liver light kidnei etc were taken out from the
insid and eaten first as be more readili cook the greek or
bone meat wa cook while the greek or inward part were be
eaten i imagin that the thigh bone made a kind of gridiron while at
the same time the marrow insid them got cook
26 ie skewer either singl doubl or even five prong the
meat would be pierc with the skewer and laid over the ash to
grillth two end of the skewer be support in whatev wai
conveni meat so cook mai be seen in ani eat hous in smyrna
or ani eastern town when i rode across the troad from the dardanel

all our outdoor cook exactli in the odyssean and iliad fashion
27 cf il xvii 567 greek the odyssean line aregreek
28 read greek for greek cf od i 186
29 the geographi of the gean as abov describ is correct but is
probabl taken from the lost poem the nosti the exist of which is
refer to od i 326 327 and 350 c a glanc at the map will

have been left unprotect and fallen into the hand of a wick

31 the greek is greek cf iliad ii 408 greek sure the
greek of the odyssean passag wa due to the greek of the iliad
no other reason suggest itself for the make menelau return on the
veri dai of the feast given by orest the fact that in the iliad
menelau came to a banquet without wait for an invit
determin the writer of the odyssei to make him come to a banquet
also uninvit but as circumst did not permit of hi have been
invit hi come uninvit is shown to have been due to chanc i do
not think the authoress thought all thi out but attribut the
strang of the coincid to unconsci cerebr and
satur
32 cf il i 458 ii 421 the writer here interrupt an iliad
passag to which she return immedi for the doubl purpos of
dwell upon the slaughter of the heifer and of let nestor wife
and daughter enjoi it also a male writer if he wa borrow from the
iliad would have stuck to hi borrow
33 cf il xxiv 587 588 where the line refer to the wash
the dead bodi of hector
34 see illustr on opposit page the yard is typic of mani
that mai be seen in sicili the exist groundplan is probabl
unmodifi from odyssean and inde long preodyssean time but the
earlier build would have no arch and would on would suppos
be mainli timber the odyssean greek were the shed that ran round
the yard as the arch do now the greek wa the on through which
the main entranc pass and which wa henc noisi or
reverber it had an upper stori in which visitor were often
lodg
35 thi journei is an imposs on telemachu and pisistratu
would have been oblig to drive over the taygetu rang over which
there ha never yet been a road for wheel vehicl it is plain
therefor that the audienc for whom the odyssei wa written wa on
that would be unlik to know anyth about the topographi of the
peloponnes so that the writer might take what liberti she chose
36 the line which i have enclos in bracket ar evid an
afterthoughtad probabl by the writer herselffor thei evinc the
same instinct greater interest in anyth that mai concern a
woman which is so notic throughout the poem there is no further
sign of ani special festiv nor of ani other guest than telemachu
and pisistratu until line 621624 ordinarili enclos in bracket
ar abruptli introduc probabl with a view of try to carri off
the introduct of the line now in question
the addit wa i imagin suggest by a desir to excus and
explain the nonappear of hermion in bk xv as also of both
hermion and megapenth in the rest of bk iv megapenth in bk xv
seem to be still a bachelor the presumpt therefor is that bk xv
wa written befor the stori of hi marriag here given i take it he
is onli marri here becaus hi sister is be marri she have
been properli attend to megapenth might as well be marri at the
same time hermion could not now be less than thirti
i have dealt with thi passag somewhat more fulli in my authoress of
the odyssei p 136138 see also p 256 of the same book
37 sparta and lacedaemon ar here treat as two differ place
though in other part of the poem it is clear that the writer
understand them as on the catalogu in the iliad which the writer
is here presum follow make the same mistak il ii 581
582
38 these last three line ar ident with il vxiii 604606
39 from the greek greek it is plain that menelau took up the
piec of meat with hi finger
40 amber is never mention in the iliad sicili where i suppos
the odyssei to have been written ha alwai been and still is on
of the princip amber produc countri it wa probabl the onli
on known in the odyssean ag see the authoress of the odyssei
longman 1898 p 186
41 thi no doubt refer to the stori told in the last poem of the
cypria about pari and helen rob menelau of the greater part of
hi treasur when thei sail togeth for troi
42 it is inconceiv that helen should enter thu in the middl
of supper intend to work with her distaff if great festiv
were go on telemachu and pisistratu ar evid dine en

43 in the italian insurrect of 1848 eight young men who were
be hotli pursu by the austrian polic hid themselv insid
donatello coloss wooden hors in the salon at padua and remain
there for a week be fed by their confeder in 1898 the last
survivor wa carri round padua in triumph
44 the greek is greek is it unfair to argu that the writer is a
person of somewhat delic sensibl to whom a strong smell of fish
is distast
45 the greek is greek i believ thi to be a hit at the writer
own countrymen who were of phocaean descent and the next follow
line to be a rejoind to complaint made against her in bk vi
273288 to the effect that she gave herself air and would marri none
of her own peopl for that the writer of the odyssei wa the person
who ha been introduc into the poem under the name of nausicaa i
cannot bring myself to question i mai remind english reader that
greek ie phoca mean seal seal almost alwai appear on
phocaean coin
46 sure here again we ar in the hand of a writer of delic
sensibl it is not as though the seal were stale thei had onli
just been kill the writer howev is obvious laugh at her own
countrymen and insult them as openli as she dare
47 we were told abov line 356 357 that it wa onli on dai
sail
48 i give the usual translat but i do not believ the greek
will warrant it the greek read greek
thi is usual held to mean that ithaca is an island fit for breed
goat and on that account more delect to the speaker than it would
have been if it were fit for breed hors i find littl author
for such a translat the most equit translat of the text as
it stand is ithaca is an island fit for breed goat and
delect rather than fit for breed hors for not on of the
island is good drive ground nor well meadow sure the writer
doe not mean that a pleasant or delect island would not be fit for
breed hors the most equit translat therefor of the
present text be thu halt and impot we mai suspect corrupt
and i hazard the follow emend though i have not adopt it in
my translat as fear that it would be deem too fanci i
would readgreek
as far as scan goe the greek is not necessari greek iv 72
footnot greek iv 233 to go no further afield than earlier line of
the same book give suffici author for greek but the greek
would not be redund it would emphasis the surpris of the
contrast and i should prefer to have it though it is not veri
import either wai thi read of cours should be translat
ithaca is an island fit for breed goat and by your leav itself
a horseman rather than fit for breed horsesfor not on of the
island is good and well meadow ground
thi would be sure to baffl the alexandrian editor how thei would
ask themselv could an island be a horseman and thei would cast
about for an emend a visit to the top of mt eryx might perhap
make the mean intellig and suggest my propos restor of
the text to the reader as readili as it did to myself
i have elsewher state my convict that the writer of the odyssei
wa familiar with the old sican citi at the top of mt eryx and that
the aegadean island which ar so strike when seen thenc did duti
with her for the ionian islandsmarettimo the highest and most
westerli of the group stand for ithaca when seen from the top of
mt eryx marettimo show as it should do accord to od ix 25 26
on the horizon all highest up in the sea toward the west while the
other island lie some wai off it to the east as we descend to
trapani marettimo appear to sink on to the top of the island of
levanzo behind which it disappear my friend the late signor e
biaggini point to it onc as it wa just stand on the top of
levanzo and said to me come cavalca bene how well it ride and
thi immedi suggest my emend to me later on i found in the
hymn to the pythian apollo which abound with tag taken from the
odyssei a line end greek which strengthen my suspicion that
thi wa the origin end of the second of the two line abov under
consider
49 see note on line 3 of thi book the reader will observ that
the writer ha been unabl to keep the women out of an interpol
consist onli of four line
50 scheria mean a piec of land jut out into the sea in my
authoress of the odyssei i thought jutland would be a suitabl
translat but it ha been point out to me that jutland onli
mean the land of the jute
51 irrig as here describ is common in garden near trapani
the water that suppli the duct is drawn from well by a mule who
turn a wheel with bucket on it
52 there is not a word here about the cattl of the sungod
53 the writer evid thought that green grow wood might also
be well season
54 the reader will note that the river wa flow with salt water
ie that it wa tidal
55 then the ogygian island wa not so far off but that nausicaa
might be assum to know where it wa
56 greek greek
57 i suspect a famili joke or sly allus to some thing of which
we know noth in thi stori of eurymedusa have been brought from
apeira the greek word apeiro mean inexperienc ignor is
it possibl that eurymedusa wa notori incompet
58 polyphemu wa also son to neptun see od ix 412 529 he
wa therefor half brother to nausith half uncl to king alcin
and half great uncl to nausicaa
59 it would seem as though the writer thought that marathon wa
close to athen
60 here the writer know that she is draw with
embellish from thing actual exist becom impati of
past tens and slide into the present
61 thi is hidden malic impli that the phaeacian magnat were
no better than thei should be the final drinkoff should have
been made to jove or neptun not to the god of thievish and
rascal of all kind in line 164 we do inde find echeneu
propos that a drinkoff should be made to jove but mercuri is
evid accord to our authoress the god who wa most like to
be of us to them
62 the fact of alcin know anyth about the cyclop
suggest that in the writer mind scheria and the countri of the
cyclop were not veri far from on anoth i take the cyclop and
the giant to be on and the same peopl
63 my properti etc the authoress is here adopt an iliad
line xix 333 and thi must account for the absenc of all refer
to penelop if she had happen to rememb il v 213 she would
doubtless have appropri it by prefer for that line read my
countri my wife and all the great of my hous
64 the at first inexplic sleep of ulyss bk xiii 79 etc
is here as also in viii 445 be obvious prepar the writer
evid attach the utmost import to it those who know that the
harbour which did duti with the writer of the odyssei for the on in
which ulyss land in ithaca wa onli about 2 mile from the place
in which ulyss is now talk with alcin will understand why the
sleep wa so necessari
65 there were two classesth lower who were found in provis
which thei had to cook for themselv in the yard and outer precinct
where thei would also eatand the upper who would eat in the cloister
of the inner court and have their cook done for them
66 translat veri dubiou i suppos the greek here to be the
cover shed that ran round the outer courtyard see illustr at
the end of bk iii
67 the writer appar deem that the word as compar with
what oxen can plough in the same time go without sai not so the
writer of the iliad from which the odyssean passag is probabl
taken he explain that mule can plough quicker than oxen il x
351353
68 it wa veri fortun that such a disc happen to be there
see that none like it were in common us
69 il xiii 37 here as so often elsewher in the odyssei
the appropri of an iliad line which is not quit appropri
puzzl the reader the thei is not the chain nor yet mar and
venu it is an overflow from the iliad passag in which neptun
hobbl hi hors in bond which none could either unloos or break
so that thei might stai there in that place if the line would have
scan without the addit of the word so that thei might stai
there in that place thei would have been omit in the odyssei
70 the reader will note that alcin never goe beyond sai that
he is go to give the goblet he never give it elsewher in both
iliad and odyssei the offer of a present is immedi follow by
the statement that it wa given and receiv gladlyalcin actual
doe give a chest and a cloak and shirtprob also some of the corn
and wine for the long twomil voyag wa provid by himbut it is
quit plain that he gave no talent and no cup
71 il xviii 344349 these line in the iliad tell of the
prepar for wash the bodi of patroclu and i am not pleas
that the writer of the odyssei should have adopt them here
72 see note 64
73 see note 43
74 the reader will find thi threat fulfil in bk xiii
75 if the other island lai some distanc awai from ithaca which
the word greek suggest what becom of the or gut between
ithaca and samo which we hear of in bk iv and xv i suspect that
the authoress in her mind make telemachu come back from pylo to the
lilybaean promontori and thenc to trapani through the strait between
the isola grand and the mainlandth island of asteria be the on
on which motya afterward stood
76 il xviii 533534 the sudden laps into the third person
here for a coupl of line is due to the fact that the two iliad
line taken ar in the third person
77 cf il ii 776 the word in both iliad and odyssei ar
footnot greek in the iliad thei ar us of the hors of
achil follow as thei stood idl champ lotu
78 i take all thi passag about the cyclop have no ship to be
sarcasticmean you peopl of drepanum have no excus for not
colonis the island of favognana which you could easili do for you
have plenti of ship and the island is a veri good on for that the
island so fulli describ here is the aegadean or goat island of
favognana and that the cyclop ar the old sican inhabit of mt
eryx should not be doubt
79 for the reason why it wa necessari that the night should be so
exception dark see the authoress of the odyssei pp 188189
80 none but such lamb as would suck if thei were with their
mother would be left in the yard the older lamb should have been out
feed the authoress ha got it all wrong but it doe not matter
see the authoress of the odyssei p 148
81 thi line is enclos in bracket in the receiv text and is
omit with note by messr butcher lang but line enclos in
bracket ar almost alwai genuin all that bracket mean is that the
bracket passag puzzl some earli editor who nevertheless found it
too well establish in the text to ventur on omit it in the
present case the line bracket is the veri last which a fullgrown
male editor would be like to interpol it is safer to infer that
the writer a young woman not know or care at which end of the
ship the rudder should be determin to make sure by place it at
both end which we shall find she present doe by repeat it line
340 at the stern of the ship as for the two rock thrown the first i
take to be the asinelli see map face p 80 the second i see as the
two contigu island of the formich which ar treat as on see
map face p 108 the asinelli is an island shape like a boat and
point to the island of favognana i think the authoresss
compatriot who probabl did not like her much better that she did
them jeer at the absurd of ulyss conduct and saw the asinelli
or donkei not as the rock thrown by polyphemu but as the boat
itself contain ulyss and hi men
82 thi line exist in the text here but not in the correspond
passag xii 141 i am inclin to think it is interpol probabl
by the poetess herself from the first of line xi 115137 which i
can hardli doubt were ad by the writer when the scheme of the work
wa enlarg and alter see the authoress of the odyssei pp
254255
83 float is not to be taken liter the island
itself as apart from it inhabit wa quit normal there is no
indic of it move dure the month that ulyss stai with
aeolu and on hi return from hi unfortun voyag he seem to have
found it in the same place the in fact should no more be press
than as appli to island odyssei xv 299where thei ar
call fly becaus the ship would fly past them so also the
wander as explain by buttmann see note on odyssei xii 57
84 liter for the wai of the night and of the dai ar near i
have seen what mr andrew lang sai homer and the epic p 236 and
longman magazin for januari 1898 p 277 about the amber rout
and the sacr wai in thi connect but until he give hi ground
for hold that the mediterranean peopl in the odyssean ag us to
go far north for their amber instead of get it in sicili where it
is still found in consider quantiti i do not know what weight i
ought to attach to hi opinion i have been unabl to find ground for
assert that bc 1000 there wa ani commerc between the
mediterranean and the far north but i shall be veri readi to learn
if mr lang will enlighten me see the authoress of the odyssei pp

85 on would have thought that when the sun wa drive the stag
down to the water ulyss might have observ it whereabout

88 thi visit is wholli without topograph signific

the writer as the phase of human which she found most interest
90 ulyss wa in fact to becom a missionari and preach neptun
to peopl who knew not hi name i wa fortun enough to meet in
sicili a woman carri on of these winnow shovel it wa not much
shorter than an oar and i wa abl at onc to see what the writer of
the odyssei intend
91 i suppos the line i have enclos in bracket to have been
ad by the author when she enlarg her origin scheme by the
addit of book iiv and xiii from line 187xxiv the reader
will observ that in the correspond passag xii 137141 the
propheci end with after lose all your comrad and that there is
no allus to the suitor for fuller explan see the authoress

ulyss wander telemachu therefor wa onli eleven year old

96 i have alreadi said in a note on bk xi 186 that at thi point
of ulyss voyag telemachu could onli be between eleven and twelv
year old
97 is the writer a man or a woman
98 cf il iv 521 greek the odyssean line read greek
the famou dactyl therefor of the odyssean line wa probabl
suggest by that of the ilead rather than by a desir to accommod
sound to sens at ani rate the doubl coincid of a dactyl line
and an end greek seem conclus as to the familiar of the
writer of the odyssei with the iliad line
99 off the coast of sicili and south itali in the month of mai i
have seen men fasten half wai up a boat mast with their feet
rest on a crosspiec just larg enough to support them from thi
point of vantag thei spear swordfish when i saw men thu emploi i
could hardli doubt that the writer of the odyssei had seen other
like them and had them in her mind when describ the bind of
ulyss i have therefor with some diffid ventur to depart from
the receiv translat of cf alcaeu frag 18 where
howev it is veri hard to sai what mean in sophocl
lexicon i find a refer to chrysostom l 242 a ed benedictin
pari 18341839 for the word which is probabl the same as
but i have look for the passag in vain
100 the writer is at fault here and tri to put it off on circ
when ulyss come to take the rout prescrib by circ he ought to
pass either the wander or some other difficulti of which we ar not
told but he doe not do so the plancta or wander merg into
scylla and charybdi and the altern between them and someth
untold merg into the altern whether ulyss had better choos
scylla or charybdi yet from line 260 it seem we ar to consid the
wander as have been pass by ulyss thi appear even more
plainli from xxiii 327 in which ulyss expressli mention the
wander rock as have been between the siren and scylla and
charybdi the writer howev is evid unawar that she doe not
quit understand her own stori her difficulti wa perhap due to the
fact that though trapanes sailor had given her a fair idea as to
where all her other local realli were no on in those dai more
than in our own could localis the plancta which in fact as buttmann
ha argu were deriv not from ani particular spot but from
sailor tale about the difficulti of navig the group of the
aeolian island as a whole see note on od x 3 still the matter
of the poor dove caught her fanci so she would not forgo them the
whirlwind of fire and the smoke that hang on scylla suggest allus
to stromboli and perhap even etna scylla is on the italian side and
therefor mai be said to look west it is about 8 mile thenc to the
sicilian coast so ulyss mai be perfectli well told that after
pass scylla he will come to the thrinacian island or sicili
charybdi is transpos to a site some few mile to the north of it
actual posit
101 i suppos thi line to have been intercal by the author
when line 426446 were ad
102 for the reason which enabl us to identifi the island of the
two siren with the lipari island now salinasth ancient didym or
twin islandse the authoress of the odyssei pp 195 196 the two
siren doubtless were as their name suggest the whistl gust or
avalanch of air that at time descend without a moment warn from

no line is us
105 the writer evid regard ulyss as on a coast that look
east at no great distanc south of the strait of messina somewher
sai near tauromenium now taormina
106 sure there must be a line miss here to tell us that the
keel and mast were carri down into charybdi besid the aorist
greek in it present surround is perplex i have translat it
as though it were an imperfect i see messr butcher and lang
translat it as a pluperfect but sure charybdi wa in the act of
suck down the water when ulyss arriv
107 i suppos the passag within bracket to have been an
afterthought but to have been written by the same hand as the rest of
the poem i suppos xii 103 to have been also ad by the writer when
she decid on send ulyss back to charybdi the simil suggest
the hand of the wife or daughter of a magistr who had often seen her
father come in cross and tire
108 gr thi put coin monei out of the question
but nevertheless impli that the gold had been work into ornament
of some kind
109 i suppos teiresia propheci of bk xi 114120 had made no
impress on ulyss more probabl the propheci wa an afterthought
intercal as i have alreadi said by the authoress when she chang
her scheme
110 a male writer would have made ulyss sai not mai you give
satisfact to your wive but mai your wive give satisfact to

water near the rock he would see the ship still at the bottom the
legend is evid a christianis version of the odyssean stori
while the name suppli the addit detail that the disast
happen in consequ of an evil counsel
118 it would seem then that the ship had got all the wai back from
ithaca in about a quarter of an hour
119 and mai we not add and also to prevent hi recognis that he
wa onli in the place where he had met nausicaa two dai earlier
120 all thi is to excus the entir absenc of minerva from book
ixxii which i suppos had been written alreadi befor the
authoress had determin on make minerva so promin a charact
121 we have met with thi somewhat lame attempt to cover the
writer chang of scheme at the end of bk vi
122 i take the follow from the authoress of the odyssei p 167
it is clear from the text that there were two cave not on but
some on ha enclos in bracket the two line in which the second
cave is mention i presum becaus he found himself puzzl by have
a second cave sprung upon him when up to thi point he had onli been
told of on
i ventur to think that if he had known the ground he would not have
been puzzl for there ar two cave distant about 80 or 100 yard
from on anoth the cave in which ulyss hid hi treasur is as i
have alreadi said identifi with singular complet the other
cave present no special featur neither in the poem nor in natur
123 there is no attempt to disguis the fact that penelop had long
given encourag to the suitor the onli defenc set up is that she
did not realli mean to encourag them would it not have been wiser to
have tri a littl discourag
124 see map near the end of bk vi ruccazz dei corvi of cours
mean the rock of the raven both name and raven still exist
125 see the authoress of the odyssei pp 140 141 the real reason
for send telemachu to pylo and lacedaemon wa that the authoress
might get helen of troi into her poem he wa sent at the onli point in
the stori at which he could be sent so he must have gone then or not
at all
126 the site i assign to eumaeuss hut close to the ruccazz dei
corvi is about 2000 feet abov the sea and command an extens
view
127 sandal such as eumaeu wa make ar still worn in the
abruzzi and elsewher an oblong piec of leather form the sole hole
ar cut at the four corner and through these hole leathern strap
ar pass which ar bound round the foot and crossgart up the
calf
128 see note 75
129 telemachu like mani anoth good young man seem to expect
everi on to fetch and carri for him
130 il vi 288 the store room wa fragrant becaus it wa made
of cedar wood see il xxiv 192
131 cf il vi 289 and 293296 the dress wa kept at the bottom
of the chest as on that would onli be want on the greatest
occas but sure the marriag of hermion and of megapenth bk
iv ad init might have induc helen to wear it on the preced
even in which case it could hardli have got back we find no hint
here of megapenth recent marriag
132 see note 83
133 cf od xi 196 etc
134 the name syra and ortygia on which island a great part of the
doric syracus wa origin built suggest that even in odyssean
time there wa a prehistor syracus the exist of which wa
known to the writer of the poem
135 liter where ar the turn of the sun assum as we
mai safe do that the syra and ortygia of the odyssei refer to
syracus it is the fact that not far to the south of these place the
land turn sharpli round so that marin follow the coast would
find the sun upon the other side of their ship to that on which theyd
had it hitherto
mr a s griffith ha kindli call my attent to herod iv 42
where speak of the circumnavig of africa by phoenician
marin under neco he write
on their return thei declaredi for my part do not believ them but
perhap other maythat in sail round libya ie africa thei had
the sun upon their right hand in thi wai wa the extent of libya
first discov
i take it that eumaeu wa made to have come from syracus becaus the
writer thought she rather ought to have made someth happen at
syracus dure her account of the voyag of ulyss she could not
howev break hi long drift from charybdi to the island of
pantellaria she therefor resolv to make it up to syracus in
anoth wai
modern excav establish the exist of two and onli two
predorian commun at syracus thei were so dr orsi inform me
at plemmirio and cozzo pantano see the authoress of the odyssei pp

136 thi harbour is again evid the harbour in which ulyss
had land ie the harbour that is now the salt work of s
cusumano
137 thi never can have been anyth but veri niggardli pai for
some eight or nine dai servic i suppos the crew were to consid
the pleasur of have had a trip to pylo as a set off there is no
trace of the dinner as have been actual given either on the
follow or ani other morn
138 no hawk can tear it prei while it is on the wing
139 the text is here appar corrupt and will not make sens as
it stand i follow messr butcher lang in omit line 101
140 ie to be milk as in south italian and sicilian town at
the present dai
141 the butcher and make readi the carcas took place partli
in the outer yard and partli in the open part of the inner court
142 these word cannot mean that it would be afternoon soon after
thei were spoken ulyss and eumaeu reach the town which wa some
wai off xvii 25 in time for the suitor earli meal xvii 170 and
176 sai at ten or eleven o clock the context of the rest of the book
show thi eumaeu and ulyss therefor cannot have start later
than eight or nine and eumaeuss word must be taken as an
exagger for the purpos of make ulyss bestir himself
143 i imagin the fountain to have been somewher about where the
church of the madonna di trapani now stand and to have been fed
with water from what is now call the fontana diffali on mt eryx
144 from thi and other passag in the odyssei it appear that
we ar in an ag anterior to the us of coin moneyan ag when
cauldron tripod sword cattl chattel of all kind measur of
corn wine or oil etc etc not to sai piec of gold silver
bronz or even iron wrought more or less but unstamp were the
nearest approach to a currenc that had as yet been reach
145 gr
146 i correct these proof abroad and am not within reach of
hesiod but sure thi passag suggest acquaint with the work
and wai though it by no mean compel it
147 it would seem as though eurynom and euryclea were the same
person see note 156
148 it is plain therefor that iri wa commonli accept as the
messeng of the god though our authoress will never permit her to
fetch or carri for ani on
149 ie the doorwai lead from the inner to the outer court
150 see note 156
151 these i imagin must have been in the open part of the inner
courtyard where the maid also stood and threw the light of their
torch into the cover cloister that ran all round it the smoke
would otherwis have been intoler
152 translat veri uncertain vide liddel and scott under
greek
153 see photo on opposit page
154 cf il ii 184 and 217 218 an addit and wellmark
featur be want to convinc penelop the writer ha taken the
hunch shoulder of thersit who is mention immedi after
euryb in the iliad and put them on to euryb back
155 thi is how gees ar now fed in sicili at ani rate in summer
when the grass is all burnt up i have never seen them graze
156 lower down line 143 euryclea sai it wa herself that had
thrown the cloak over ulyssesfor the plural should not be taken as
impli more than on person the writer is evid still
fluctuat between euryclea and eurynom as the name for the old
nurs she probabl origin meant to call her euryclea but find
it not immedi easi to make euryclea scan in xvii 495 she hastili
call her eurynom intend either to alter thi name later or to
chang the earlier euryclea into eurynom she then drift in to
eurynom as conveni further direct still nevertheless hanker
after euryclea till at last she found that the path of least
resist would lie in the direct of make eurynom and euryclea
two person therefor in xxiii 289292 both eurynom and the nurs
who can be none other than euryclea come on togeth i do not sai
that thi is feminin but it is not unfeminin
157 see note 156
158 thi i take it wa immedi in front of the main entranc
of the inner courtyard into the bodi of the hous
159 thi is the onli allus to sardinia in either iliad or
odyssei
160 the normal translat of the greek word would be hold
back curb restrain but i cannot think that the writer
meant thissh must have been us the word in it other sens of
have hold keep maintain
161 i have vainli tri to realis the construct of the
fasten here describ
162 see plan of ulyss hous in the appendix it is evid that
the open part of the court had no floor but the natur soil
163 see plan of ulyss hous and note 175
164 ie the door that led into the bodi of the hous
165 thi wa no doubt the littl tabl that wa set for ulyss
od xx 259
sure the difficulti of thi passag ha been overr i suppos the
iron part of the ax to have been wedg into the handl or bound
secur to itth handl be half buri in the ground the ax
would be place edgewai toward the archer and he would have to shoot
hi arrow through the hole into which the handl wa fit when the
ax wa in us twelv ax were place in a row all at the same
height all exactli in front of on anoth all edgewai to ulyss
whose arrow pass through all the hole from the first onward i
cannot see how the greek can bear ani other interpret the word
be greek
he did not miss a singl hole from the first onward greek
accord to liddel and scott be the hole for the handl of an
ax etc while greek od v 236 is accord to the same
author the handl itself the feat is absurdli imposs but
our authoress sometim ha a soul abov imposs
166 the reader will note how the spoil of good food distress
the writer even in such a suprem moment as thi
167 here we have it again wast of substanc come first
168 cf il iii 337 and three other place it is strang that
the author of the iliad should find a littl horsehair so alarm
possibl enough she wa mere borrow a common form line from some
earlier poetor poetessfor thi is a woman line rather than a
man
169 or perhap simpli window see plan in the appendix
170 ie the pavement on which ulyss wa stand
171 the interpret of line 126143 is most dubiou and at
best we ar in a region of melodrama cf howev i 425 etc from
which it appear that there wa a tower in the outer court and that
telemachu us to sleep in it the i take to be a door or
trap door lead on to the roof abov telemachuss bed room which we
ar told wa in a place that could be seen from all roundor it might
be simpli a window in telemachuss room look out into the street
from the top of the tower the outer world wa to be told what wa go
on but peopl could not get in by the thei would have to
come in by the main entranc and melanthiu explain that the mouth of
the narrow passag which wa in the land of ulyss and hi friend
command the onli entranc by which help could come so that there
would be noth gain by rais an alarm
as for the of line 143 no comment ancient or modern ha
been abl to sai what wa intendedbut whatev thei were
melanthiu could never carri twelv shield twelv helmet and
twelv spear moreov where he could go the other could go
also if a dozen suitor had follow melanthiu into the hous
thei could have attack ulyss in the rear in which case unless
minerva had interven promptli the odyssei would have had a
differ end but throughout the scene we ar in a region of
extravag rather than of true fictionit cannot be taken
serious by ani but the veri seriou until we come to the episod
of phemiu and medon where the writer begin to be at home again
172 i presum it wa intend that there should be a hook driven
into the bearingpost
173 what for
174 gr greek thi is not greek
175 from line 333 and 341 of thi book and line 145 and 146 of
bk xxi we can locat the approach to the greek with some certainti
176 but in xix 500502 ulyss scold euryclea for offer
inform on thi veri point and declar himself quit abl to
settl it for himself
177 there were a hundr and eight suitor
178 lord grimthorp whose understand doe not lend itself to
easi imposit ha been good enough to write to me about my
convict that the odyssei wa written by a woman and to send me
remark upon the gross absurd of the incid here record it is
plain that all the authoress care about wa that the women should be
hang as for attempt to realis or to make her reader realis
how the hang wa done thi wa of no consequ the reader must
take her word for it and ask no question lord grimthorp wrote
i had better send you my idea about nausicaa hang of the maid
not maiden of whom froud wrote so well in hi scienc of
histori befor i forget it all luckili for me liddel scott have
special translat most of the doubt word refer to thi veri
place
a ship cabl i dont know how big a ship she meant but it must
have been a veri small on inde if it cabl could be us to tie
tightli round a woman neck and still more round a dozen of them in
a row besid be strong enough to hold them and pull them all up
a dozen averag women would need the weight and strength of more than
a dozen strong heavi men even over the best pullei hung to the roof
over them and the idea of pull them up by a rope hung anyhow round
a pillar greek is absurdli imposs and how a dozen of them could
be hung dangl round on post is a problem which a senior wrangler
would be puzzl to answer she had better have let telemachu us
hi sword as he had intend till she chang hi mind for him
179 then thei had all been in ulyss servic over twenti year
perhap the twelv guilti on had been engag more recent
180 translat veri doubtfulcf it xxiv 598
181 but why could she not at onc ask to see the scar of which
euryclea had told her or why could not ulyss have shown it to her
182 the peopl of ithaca seem to have been as fond of carp as
the phaeacian were in vi 273 etc
183 see note 156 ulyssess bed room doe not appear to have been
upstair nor yet quit within the hous is it possibl that it wa
the dome room round the outsid of which the er maid were for
aught we have heard to the contrari still hang
184 ulyss bedroom in the mind of the writer is here too
appar down stair
185 penelop have been now suffici whitewash disappear
from the poem
186 so practis a washerwoman as our authoress doubtless knew that
by thi time the web must have becom such a wreck that it would have
gone to piec in the wash
a ladi point out to me just as these sheet ar leav my hand
that no realli good needlewomanno on inde whose work or charact
wa worth considerationcould have endur no matter for what reason
the unpick of her dai work dai after dai for between three and
four year
187 we must suppos doliu not yet to know that hi son melanthiu
had been tortur mutil and left to die by ulyss order on the
