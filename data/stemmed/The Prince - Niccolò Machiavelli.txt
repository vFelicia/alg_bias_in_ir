nicolo machiavelli wa born at florenc on 3rd mai 1469 he wa the
second son of bernardo di nicolo machiavelli a lawyer of some reput
and of bartolommea di stefano nelli hi wife both parent were

florenc wa free under the govern of a republ which last
until 1512 when the medici return to power and machiavelli lost hi
offic the medici again rule florenc from 1512 until 1527 when thei
were onc more driven out thi wa the period of machiavelli
literari activ and increas influenc but he di within a few
week of the expuls of the medici on 22nd june 1527 in hi
fiftyeighth year without have regain offic
youth t 125146994
although there is littl record of the youth of machiavelli the
florenc of those dai is so well known that the earli environ of
thi repres citizen mai be easili imagin florenc ha been
describ as a citi with two opposit current of life on direct by
the fervent and auster savonarola the other by the splendourlov
lorenzo savonarola influenc upon the young machiavelli must have
been slight for although at on time he wield immens power over the
fortun of florenc he onli furnish machiavelli with a subject of a
gibe in the princ where he is cite as an exampl of an unarm
prophet who came to a bad end wherea the magnific of the medicean
rule dure the life of lorenzo appear to have impress machiavelli
strongli for he frequent recur to it in hi write and it is to
lorenzo grandson that he dedic the princ
machiavelli in hi histori of florenc give us a pictur of the
young men among whom hi youth wa pass he write thei were freer
than their forefath in dress and live and spent more in other
kind of excess consum their time and monei in idl game
and women their chief aim wa to appear well dress and to speak with
wit and acut whilst he who could wound other the most cleverli
wa thought the wisest in a letter to hi son guido machiavelli
show why youth should avail itself of it opportun for studi and
lead us to infer that hi own youth had been so occupi he write
i have receiv your letter which ha given me the greatest pleasur
especi becaus you tell me you ar quit restor in health than

and music for you see what honour is done to me for the littl skill i
have therefor my son if you wish to pleas me and to bring success
and honour to yourself do right and studi becaus other will help
you if you help yourself

the second period of machiavelli life wa spent in the servic of the
free republ of florenc which flourish as state abov from the
expuls of the medici in 1494 until their return in 1512 after
serv four year in on of the public offic he wa appoint
chancellor and secretari to the second chanceri the ten of liberti and
peac here we ar on firm ground when deal with the event of
machiavelli life for dure thi time he took a lead part in the
affair of the republ and we have it decre record and
dispatch to guid us as well as hi own write a mere
recapitul of a few of hi transact with the statesmen and
soldier of hi time give a fair indic of hi activ and
suppli the sourc from which he drew the experi and charact
which illustr the princ
hi first mission wa in 1499 to catherina sforza my ladi of forli
of the princ from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it
is far better to earn the confid of the peopl than to reli on
fortress thi is a veri notic principl in machiavelli and is
urg by him in mani wai as a matter of vital import to princ
in 1500 he wa sent to franc to obtain term from loui xii for
continu the war against pisa thi king it wa who in hi conduct
of affair in itali commit the five capit error in statecraft
summar in the princ and wa consequ driven out he also
it wa who made the dissolut of hi marriag a condit of support
to pope alexand vi which lead machiavelli to refer those who urg
that such promis should be kept to what he ha written concern the
faith of princ
machiavelli public life wa larg occupi with event aris out
of the ambit of pope alexand vi and hi son cesar borgia the
duke valentino and these charact fill a larg space of the
princ machiavelli never hesit to cite the action of the duke
for the benefit of usurp who wish to keep the state thei have
seiz he can inde find no precept to offer so good as the
pattern of cesar borgia conduct insomuch that cesar is acclaim
by some critic as the hero of the princ yet in the princ the
duke is in point of fact cite as a type of the man who rise on the
fortun of other and fall with them who take everi cours that
might be expect from a prudent man but the cours which will save
him who is prepar for all eventu but the on which happen
and who when all hi abil fail to carri him through exclaim
that it wa not hi fault but an extraordinari and unforeseen
fatal
on the death of piu iii in 1503 machiavelli wa sent to rome to
watch the elect of hi successor and there he saw cesar borgia
cheat into allow the choic of the colleg to fall on giuliano
dell rover juliu ii who wa on of the cardin that had most
reason to fear the duke machiavelli when comment on thi elect
sai that he who think new favour will caus great personag to
forget old injuri deceiv himself juliu did not rest until he had
ruin cesar
it wa to juliu ii that machiavelli wa sent in 1506 when that
pontiff wa commenc hi enterpris against bologna which he brought
to a success issu as he did mani of hi other adventur ow
chiefli to hi impetu charact it is in refer to pope juliu
that machiavelli moral on the resembl between fortun and
women and conclud that it is the bold rather than the cautiou man
that will win and hold them both
it is imposs to follow here the vari fortun of the italian
state which in 1507 were control by franc spain and germani
with result that have last to our dai we ar concern with those
event and with the three great actor in them so far onli as thei
imping on the person of machiavelli he had sever meet with
loui xii of franc and hi estim of that monarch charact ha
alreadi been allud to machiavelli ha paint ferdinand of aragon as
the man who accomplish great thing under the cloak of religion but
who in realiti had no merci faith human or integr and who
had he allow himself to be influenc by such motiv would have
been ruin the emperor maximilian wa on of the most interest men
of the ag and hi charact ha been drawn by mani hand but
machiavelli who wa an envoi at hi court in 15078 reveal the
secret of hi mani failur when he describ him as a secret man
without forc of characterignor the human agenc necessari to
carri hi scheme into effect and never insist on the fulfil of
hi wish
the remain year of machiavelli offici career were fill with
event aris out of the leagu of cambrai made in 1508 between the
three great european power alreadi mention and the pope with the
object of crush the venetian republ thi result wa attain in
the battl of vaila when venic lost in on dai all that she had won
in eight hundr year florenc had a difficult part to plai dure
these event complic as thei were by the feud which broke out
between the pope and the french becaus friendship with franc had
dictat the entir polici of the republ when in 1511 juliu ii
final form the holi leagu against franc and with the assist
of the swiss drove the french out of itali florenc lai at the merci
of the pope and had to submit to hi term on of which wa that the
medici should be restor the return of the medici to florenc on 1st
septemb 1512 and the consequ fall of the republ wa the signal
for the dismiss of machiavelli and hi friend and thu put an end
to hi public career for as we have seen he di without regain
offic
literatur and death t 4358151227
on the return of the medici machiavelli who for a few week had
vainli hope to retain hi offic under the new master of florenc
wa dismiss by decre date 7th novemb 1512 shortli after thi he
wa accus of complic in an abort conspiraci against the medici
imprison and put to the question by tortur the new medicean pope
leo x procur hi releas and he retir to hi small properti at
san casciano near florenc where he devot himself to literatur in
a letter to francesco vettori date 13th decemb 1513 he ha left a
veri interest descript of hi life at thi period which
elucid hi method and hi motiv in write the princ after
describ hi daili occup with hi famili and neighbour he
write the even be come i return home and go to my studi at
the entranc i pull off my peasantcloth cover with dust and dirt
and put on my nobl court dress and thu becomingli recloth i pass
into the ancient court of the men of old where be lovingli
receiv by them i am fed with that food which is mine alon where i
do not hesit to speak with them and to ask for the reason of their
action and thei in their benign answer me and for four hour i
feel no weari i forget everi troubl poverti doe not dismai
death doe not terrifi me i am possess entir by those great men
and becaus dant sai
knowledg doth come of learn well retain
unfruit els
i have note down what i have gain from their convers and have
compos a small work on princip where i pour myself out as
fulli as i can in medit on the subject discuss what a
princip is what kind there ar how thei can be acquir how
thei can be kept why thei ar lost and if ani of my fanci ever
pleas you thi ought not to displeas you and to a princ
especi to a new on it should be welcom therefor i dedic it
to hi magnific giuliano filippo casavecchio ha seen it he will
be abl to tell you what is in it and of the discours i have had
with him nevertheless i am still enrich and polish it
the littl book suffer mani vicissitud befor attain the form
in which it ha reach us variou mental influenc were at work
dure it composit it titl and patron were chang and for some
unknown reason it wa final dedic to lorenzo de medici although
machiavelli discuss with casavecchio whether it should be sent or
present in person to the patron there is no evid that lorenzo
ever receiv or even read it he certainli never gave machiavelli ani
employ although it wa plagiar dure machiavelli lifetim
the princ wa never publish by him and it text is still
disput
machiavelli conclud hi letter to vettori thu and as to thi
littl thing hi book when it ha been read it will be seen that
dure the fifteen year i have given to the studi of statecraft i have
neither slept nor idl and men ought ever to desir to be serv by
on who ha reap experi at the expens of other and of my
loyalti none could doubt becaus have alwai kept faith i could not
now learn how to break it for he who ha been faith and honest as
i have cannot chang hi natur and my poverti is a wit to my
honesti
befor machiavelli had got the princ off hi hand he commenc hi
discours on the first decad of titu liviu which should be read
concurr with the princ these and sever minor work occupi
him until the year 1518 when he accept a small commiss to look
after the affair of some florentin merchant at genoa in 1519 the
medicean ruler of florenc grant a few polit concess to her
citizen and machiavelli with other wa consult upon a new
constitut under which the great council wa to be restor but on
on pretext or anoth it wa not promulg
in 1520 the florentin merchant again had recours to machiavelli to
settl their difficulti with lucca but thi year wa chiefli
remark for hi reentri into florentin literari societi where he
wa much sought after and also for the product of hi art of war
it wa in the same year that he receiv a commiss at the instanc
of cardin de medici to write the histori of florenc a task which
occupi him until 1525 hi return to popular favour mai have
determin the medici to give him thi employ for an old writer
observ that an abl statesman out of work like a huge whale will
endeavour to overturn the ship unless he ha an empti cask to plai
with
when the histori of florenc wa finish machiavelli took it to
rome for present to hi patron giuliano de medici who had in
the meanwhil becom pope under the titl of clement vii it is
somewhat remark that as in 1513 machiavelli had written the
princ for the instruct of the medici after thei had just regain
power in florenc so in 1525 he dedic the histori of florenc
to the head of the famili when it ruin wa now at hand in that year
the battl of pavia destroi the french rule in itali and left
franci i a prison in the hand of hi great rival charl v thi
wa follow by the sack of rome upon the new of which the popular
parti at florenc threw off the yoke of the medici who were onc more
banish
machiavelli wa absent from florenc at thi time but hasten hi
return hope to secur hi former offic of secretari to the ten of
liberti and peac unhappili he wa taken ill soon after he reach
florenc where he di on 22nd june 1527
the man and hi work
no on can sai where the bone of machiavelli rest but modern florenc
ha decre him a state cenotaph in santa croce by the side of her
most famou son recogn that whatev other nation mai have
found in hi work itali found in them the idea of her uniti and the
germ of her renaiss among the nation of europ whilst it is idl
to protest against the worldwid and evil signif of hi name
it mai be point out that the harsh construct of hi doctrin which
thi sinist reput impli wa unknown to hi own dai and that
the research of recent time have enabl us to interpret him more
reason it is due to these inquiri that the shape of an unholi
necromanc which so long haunt men vision ha begun to fade
machiavelli wa undoubtedli a man of great observ acut and
industri note with appreci ey whatev pass befor him and
with hi suprem literari gift turn it to account in hi enforc
retir from affair he doe not present himself nor is he
depict by hi contemporari as a type of that rare combin the
success statesman and author for he appear to have been onli
moder prosper in hi sever embassi and polit
employ he wa misl by catherina sforza ignor by loui xii
overaw by cesar borgia sever of hi embassi were quit barren
of result hi attempt to fortifi florenc fail and the soldieri
that he rais astonish everybodi by their cowardic in the conduct
of hi own affair he wa timid and timeserv he dare not appear
by the side of soderini to whom he ow so much for fear of
compromis himself hi connect with the medici wa open to
suspicion and giuliano appear to have recogn hi real fort when
he set him to write the histori of florenc rather than emploi him
in the state and it is on the literari side of hi charact and
there alon that we find no weak and no failur
although the light of almost four centuri ha been focus on the
princ it problem ar still debat and interest becaus thei
ar the etern problem between the rule and their ruler such as
thei ar it ethic ar those of machiavelli contemporari yet
thei cannot be said to be out of date so long as the govern of
europ reli on materi rather than on moral forc it histor
incid and personag becom interest by reason of the us which
machiavelli make of them to illustr hi theori of govern and
conduct
leav out of consider those maxim of state which still furnish
some european and eastern statesmen with principl of action the
princ is bestrewn with truth that can be prove at everi turn men
ar still the dupe of their simplic and greed as thei were in the
dai of alexand vi the cloak of religion still conceal the vice
which machiavelli laid bare in the charact of ferdinand of aragon
men will not look at thing as thei realli ar but as thei wish them
to beand ar ruin in polit there ar no perfectli safe cours
prudenc consist in choos the least danger on thento pass to
a higher planemachiavelli reiter that although crime mai win an
empir thei do not win glori necessari war ar just war and the
arm of a nation ar hallow when it ha no other resourc but to
fight
it is the cry of a far later dai than machiavelli that govern
should be elev into a live moral forc capabl of inspir the
peopl with a just recognit of the fundament principl of
societi to thi high argument the princ contribut but littl
machiavelli alwai refus to write either of men or of govern
otherwis than as he found them and he write with such skill and
insight that hi work is of abid valu but what invest the
princ with more than a mere artist or histor interest is the
incontrovert truth that it deal with the great principl which
still guid nation and ruler in their relationship with each other
and their neighbour
in translat the princ my aim ha been to achiev at all cost an
exact liter render of the origin rather than a fluent
paraphras adapt to the modern notion of style and express
machiavelli wa no facil phrasemong the condit under which he
wrote oblig him to weigh everi word hi theme were lofti hi
substanc grave hi manner nobli plain and seriou qui eo fuit
unquam in partiundi rebu in definiendi in explanandi pressior
in the princ it mai be truli said there is reason assign not
onli for everi word but for the posit of everi word to an
englishman of shakespear time the translat of such a treatis wa
in some wai a compar easi task for in those time the geniu
of the english more nearli resembl that of the italian languag to
the englishman of todai it is not so simpl to take a singl exampl
the word intrattener emploi by machiavelli to indic the polici
adopt by the roman senat toward the weaker state of greec would
by an elizabethan be correctli render entertain and everi
contemporari reader would understand what wa meant by sai that
rome entertain the tolian and the achaean without augment
their power but todai such a phrase would seem obsolet and
ambigu if not unmean we ar compel to sai that rome
maintain friendli relat with the tolian etc us four
word to do the work of on i have tri to preserv the pithi breviti
of the italian so far as wa consist with an absolut fidel to
the sens if the result be an occasion asper i can onli hope that
the reader in hi eager to reach the author mean mai
overlook the rough of the road that lead him to it

those who strive to obtain the good grace of a princ ar accustom

which thei see him take most delight whenc on often see hors
arm cloth of gold preciou stone and similar ornament present
to princ worthi of their great
desir therefor to present myself to your magnific with some
testimoni of my devot toward you i have not found among my
possess anyth which i hold more dear than or valu so much as
the knowledg of the action of great men acquir by long experi

have reflect upon it with great and prolong dilig i now

nevertheless i trust much to your benign that it mai be accept
see that it is not possibl for me to make a better gift than to
offer you the opportun of understand in the shortest time all

danger which work i have not embellish with swell or magnific
word nor stuf with round period nor with ani extrins
allur or adorn whatev with which so mani ar accustom
to embellish their work for i have wish either that no honour
should be given it or els that the truth of the matter and the
weighti of the theme shall make it accept
nor do i hold with those who regard it as a presumpt if a man of low
and humbl condit dare to discuss and settl the concern of
princ becaus just as those who draw landscap place themselv
below in the plain to contempl the natur of the mountain and of

the princ
chapter i
how mani kind of princip there ar and by what mean thei ar
acquir
all state all power that have held and hold rule over men have been
and ar either republ or princip
princip ar either hereditari in which the famili ha been long
establish or thei ar new
the new ar either entir new as wa milan to francesco sforza or
thei ar as it were member annex to the hereditari state of the
princ who ha acquir them as wa the kingdom of napl to that of
the king of spain
such dominion thu acquir ar either accustom to live under a
princ or to live in freedom and ar acquir either by the arm of
the princ himself or of other or els by fortun or by abil
chapter ii
concern hereditari princip
i will leav out all discuss on republ inasmuch as in anoth
place i have written of them at length and will address myself onli to
princip in do so i will keep to the order indic abov
and discuss how such princip ar to be rule and preserv
i sai at onc there ar fewer difficulti in hold hereditari
state and those long accustom to the famili of their princ than
new on for it is suffici onli not to transgress the custom of
hi ancestor and to deal prudent with circumst as thei aris
for a princ of averag power to maintain himself in hi state unless
he be depriv of it by some extraordinari and excess forc and if
he should be so depriv of it whenev anyth sinist happen to
the usurp he will regain it
we have in itali for exampl the duke of ferrara who could not have
withstood the attack of the venetian in 84 nor those of pope juliu
in 10 unless he had been long establish in hi dominion for the
hereditari princ ha less caus and less necess to offend henc it
happen that he will be more love and unless extraordinari vice
caus him to be hate it is reason to expect that hi subject
will be natur well dispos toward him and in the antiqu and
durat of hi rule the memori and motiv that make for chang ar
lost for on chang alwai leav the tooth for anoth
chapter iii
concern mix princip
but the difficulti occur in a new princip and firstli if it be
not entir new but is as it were a member of a state which taken
collect mai be call composit the chang aris chiefli from
an inher difficulti which there is in all new princip for
men chang their ruler willingli hope to better themselv and
thi hope induc them to take up arm against him who rule wherein
thei ar deceiv becaus thei afterward find by experi thei have
gone from bad to wors thi follow also on anoth natur and common
necess which alwai caus a new princ to burden those who have
submit to him with hi soldieri and with infinit other hardship
which he must put upon hi new acquisit
in thi wai you have enemi in all those whom you have injur in
seiz that princip and you ar not abl to keep those friend
who put you there becaus of your not be abl to satisfi them in the
wai thei expect and you cannot take strong measur against them
feel bound to them for although on mai be veri strong in arm
forc yet in enter a provinc on ha alwai need of the goodwil
of the nativ
for these reason loui the twelfth king of franc quickli occupi
milan and as quickli lost it and to turn him out the first time it
onli need lodovico own forc becaus those who had open the
gate to him find themselv deceiv in their hope of futur
benefit would not endur the illtreat of the new princ it is
veri true that after acquir rebelli provinc a second time
thei ar not so lightli lost afterward becaus the princ with
littl reluct take the opportun of the rebellion to punish the
delinqu to clear out the suspect and to strengthen himself in
the weakest place thu to caus franc to lose milan the first time
it wa enough for the duke lodovico1 to rais insurrect on the
border but to caus him to lose it a second time it wa necessari to
bring the whole world against him and that hi armi should be
defeat and driven out of itali which follow from the caus abov
mention
1 duke lodovico wa lodovico moro a son of francesco sforza who
marri beatric dest he rule over milan from 1494 to 1500 and
di in 1510
nevertheless milan wa taken from franc both the first and the second
time the gener reason for the first have been discuss it remain
to name those for the second and to see what resourc he had and
what ani on in hi situat would have had for maintain himself
more secur in hi acquisit than did the king of franc
now i sai that those dominion which when acquir ar ad to an
ancient state by him who acquir them ar either of the same countri
and languag or thei ar not when thei ar it is easier to hold
them especi when thei have not been accustom to selfgovern
and to hold them secur it is enough to have destroi the famili of
the princ who wa rule them becaus the two peopl preserv in
other thing the old condit and not be unlik in custom will
live quietli togeth as on ha seen in brittani burgundi gasconi
and normandi which have been bound to franc for so long a time and
although there mai be some differ in languag nevertheless the
custom ar alik and the peopl will easili be abl to get on amongst
themselv he who ha annex them if he wish to hold them ha
onli to bear in mind two consider the on that the famili of
their former lord is extinguish the other that neither their law
nor their tax ar alter so that in a veri short time thei will
becom entir on bodi with the old princip
but when state ar acquir in a countri differ in languag
custom or law there ar difficulti and good fortun and great
energi ar need to hold them and on of the greatest and most real
help would be that he who ha acquir them should go and resid
there thi would make hi posit more secur and durabl as it ha
made that of the turk in greec who notwithstand all the other
measur taken by him for hold that state if he had not settl
there would not have been abl to keep it becaus if on is on the
spot disord ar seen as thei spring up and on can quickli remedi
them but if on is not at hand thei ar heard of onli when thei ar
great and then on can no longer remedi them besid thi the
countri is not pillag by your offici the subject ar satisfi
by prompt recours to the princ thu wish to be good thei have
more caus to love him and wish to be otherwis to fear him he
who would attack that state from the outsid must have the utmost
caution as long as the princ resid there it can onli be wrest
from him with the greatest difficulti
the other and better cours is to send coloni to on or two place
which mai be as kei to that state for it is necessari either to do
thi or els to keep there a great number of cavalri and infantri a
princ doe not spend much on coloni for with littl or no expens
he can send them out and keep them there and he offend a minor
onli of the citizen from whom he take land and hous to give them
to the new inhabit and those whom he offend remain poor and
scatter ar never abl to injur him whilst the rest be
uninjur ar easili kept quiet and at the same time ar anxiou not
to err for fear it should happen to them as it ha to those who have
been despoil in conclus i sai that these coloni ar not
costli thei ar more faith thei injur less and the injur as
ha been said be poor and scatter cannot hurt upon thi on
ha to remark that men ought either to be well treat or crush
becaus thei can aveng themselv of lighter injuri of more seriou
on thei cannot therefor the injuri that is to be done to a man
ought to be of such a kind that on doe not stand in fear of reveng
but in maintain arm men there in place of coloni on spend much
more have to consum on the garrison all the incom from the state
so that the acquisit turn into a loss and mani more ar
exasper becaus the whole state is injur through the shift
of the garrison up and down all becom acquaint with hardship and
all becom hostil and thei ar enemi who whilst beaten on their
own ground ar yet abl to do hurt for everi reason therefor such
guard ar as useless as a coloni is us
again the princ who hold a countri differ in the abov respect
ought to make himself the head and defend of hi less power
neighbour and to weaken the more power amongst them take care
that no foreign as power as himself shall by ani accid get a
foot there for it will alwai happen that such a on will be
introduc by those who ar discont either through excess of
ambit or through fear as on ha seen alreadi the roman were
brought into greec by the tolian and in everi other countri where
thei obtain a foot thei were brought in by the inhabit and
the usual cours of affair is that as soon as a power foreign
enter a countri all the subject state ar drawn to him move by the
hatr which thei feel against the rule power so that in respect to
those subject state he ha not to take ani troubl to gain them over
to himself for the whole of them quickli ralli to the state which he
ha acquir there he ha onli to take care that thei do not get hold
of too much power and too much author and then with hi own forc
and with their goodwil he can easili keep down the more power of
them so as to remain entir master in the countri and he who doe
not properli manag thi busi will soon lose what he ha acquir
and whilst he doe hold it he will have endless difficulti and
troubl
the roman in the countri which thei annex observ close these
measur thei sent coloni and maintain friendli relat with2
the minor power without increas their strength thei kept down the
greater and did not allow ani strong foreign power to gain author
greec appear to me suffici for an exampl the achaean and
tolian were kept friendli by them the kingdom of macedonia wa
humbl antiochu wa driven out yet the merit of the achaean and
tolian never secur for them permiss to increas their power nor
did the persuas of philip ever induc the roman to be hi friend
without first humbl him nor did the influenc of antiochu make
them agre that he should retain ani lordship over the countri becaus
the roman did in these instanc what all prudent princ ought to do
who have to regard not onli present troubl but also futur on for
which thei must prepar with everi energi becaus when foreseen it
is easi to remedi them but if you wait until thei approach the
medicin is no longer in time becaus the maladi ha becom incur
for it happen in thi as the physician sai it happen in hectic
fever that in the begin of the maladi it is easi to cure but
difficult to detect but in the cours of time not have been either
detect or treat in the begin it becom easi to detect but
difficult to cure thu it happen in affair of state for when the
evil that aris have been foreseen which it is onli given to a wise
man to see thei can be quickli redress but when through not
have been foreseen thei have been permit to grow in a wai that
everi on can see them there is no longer a remedi therefor the
roman forese troubl dealt with them at onc and even to
avoid a war would not let them come to a head for thei knew that war
is not to be avoid but is onli to be put off to the advantag of
other moreov thei wish to fight with philip and antiochu in
greec so as not to have to do it in itali thei could have avoid
both but thi thei did not wish nor did that ever pleas them which
is forev in the mouth of the wise on of our timelet us enjoi the
benefit of the timebut rather the benefit of their own valour and
prudenc for time drive everyth befor it and is abl to bring
with it good as well as evil and evil as well as good
2 see remark in the introduct on the word intrattener
but let us turn to franc and inquir whether she ha done ani of the
thing mention i will speak of louis3 and not of charles4 as
the on whose conduct is the better to be observ he have held
possess of itali for the longest period and you will see that he
ha done the opposit to those thing which ought to be done to retain
a state compos of diver element
3 loui xii king of franc the father of the peopl born 1462
di 1515
4 charl viii king of franc born 1470 di 1498
king loui wa brought into itali by the ambit of the venetian who
desir to obtain half the state of lombardi by hi intervent i
will not blame the cours taken by the king becaus wish to get a
foothold in itali and have no friend therese rather that everi
door wa shut to him ow to the conduct of charlesh wa forc to
accept those friendship which he could get and he would have
succeed veri quickli in hi design if in other matter he had not
made some mistak the king howev have acquir lombardi
regain at onc the author which charl had lost genoa yield
the florentin becam hi friend the marquess of mantua the duke of
ferrara the bentivogli my ladi of forli the lord of faenza of
pesaro of rimini of camerino of piombino the lucches the pisan
the sieneseeverybodi made advanc to him to becom hi friend then
could the venetian realiz the rash of the cours taken by them
which in order that thei might secur two town in lombardi had made
the king master of twothird of itali
let ani on now consid with what littl difficulti the king could
have maintain hi posit in itali had he observ the rule abov
laid down and kept all hi friend secur and protect for although
thei were numer thei were both weak and timid some afraid of the
church some of the venetian and thu thei would alwai have been
forc to stand in with him and by their mean he could easili have
made himself secur against those who remain power but he wa no
sooner in milan than he did the contrari by assist pope alexand to
occupi the romagna it never occur to him that by thi action he wa
weaken himself depriv himself of friend and of those who had
thrown themselv into hi lap whilst he aggrand the church by
ad much tempor power to the spiritu thu give it greater
author and have commit thi prime error he wa oblig to
follow it up so much so that to put an end to the ambit of
alexand and to prevent hi becom the master of tuscani he wa
himself forc to come into itali
and as if it were not enough to have aggrand the church and
depriv himself of friend he wish to have the kingdom of napl
divid it with the king of spain and where he wa the prime arbit
in itali he take an associ so that the ambiti of that countri
and the malcont of hi own should have somewher to shelter and
wherea he could have left in the kingdom hi own pension as king he
drove him out to put on there who wa abl to drive him loui out
in turn
the wish to acquir is in truth veri natur and common and men alwai
do so when thei can and for thi thei will be prais not blame but
when thei cannot do so yet wish to do so by ani mean then there is
folli and blame therefor if franc could have attack napl with
her own forc she ought to have done so if she could not then she
ought not to have divid it and if the partit which she made with
the venetian in lombardi wa justifi by the excus that by it she
got a foothold in itali thi other partit merit blame for it had
not the excus of that necess
therefor loui made these five error he destroi the minor power
he increas the strength of on of the greater power in itali he
brought in a foreign power he did not settl in the countri he did
not send coloni which error had he live were not enough to
injur him had he not made a sixth by take awai their dominion from
the venetian becaus had he not aggrand the church nor brought
spain into itali it would have been veri reason and necessari to
humbl them but have first taken these step he ought never to have
consent to their ruin for thei be power would alwai have
kept off other from design on lombardi to which the venetian would
never have consent except to becom master themselv there also
becaus the other would not wish to take lombardi from franc in order
to give it to the venetian and to run counter to both thei would not
have had the courag
and if ani on should sai king loui yield the romagna to alexand
and the kingdom to spain to avoid war i answer for the reason given
abov that a blunder ought never to be perpetr to avoid war
becaus it is not to be avoid but is onli defer to your
disadvantag and if anoth should alleg the pledg which the king
had given to the pope that he would assist him in the enterpris in
exchang for the dissolut of hi marriage5 and for the cap to
rouen6 to that i repli what i shall write later on concern the
faith of princ and how it ought to be kept

6 the archbishop of rouen he wa georg dambois creat a
cardin by alexand vi born 1460 di 1510
thu king loui lost lombardi by not have follow ani of the
condit observ by those who have taken possess of countri and
wish to retain them nor is there ani miracl in thi but much that
is reason and quit natur and on these matter i spoke at nant
with rouen when valentino as cesar borgia the son of pope
alexand wa usual call occupi the romagna and on cardin
rouen observ to me that the italian did not understand war i
repli to him that the french did not understand statecraft mean
that otherwis thei would not have allow the church to reach such
great and in fact it ha been seen that the great of the
church and of spain in itali ha been caus by franc and her ruin
mai be attribut to them from thi a gener rule is drawn which
never or rare fail that he who is the caus of anoth becom
power is ruin becaus that predomin ha been brought about
either by astut or els by forc and both ar distrust by him
who ha been rais to power
chapter iv
why the kingdom of dariu conquer by alexand did not rebel
against the successor of alexand at hi death
consid the difficulti which men have had to hold to a newli
acquir state some might wonder how see that alexand the great
becam the master of asia in a few year and di whilst it wa
scarc settl whenc it might appear reason that the whole
empir would have rebel nevertheless hi successor maintain
themselv and had to meet no other difficulti than that which aros
among themselv from their own ambit
i answer that the princip of which on ha record ar found to
be govern in two differ wai either by a princ with a bodi of
servant who assist him to govern the kingdom as minist by hi
favour and permiss or by a princ and baron who hold that digniti
by antiqu of blood and not by the grace of the princ such baron
have state and their own subject who recogn them as lord and
hold them in natur affect those state that ar govern by a
princ and hi servant hold their princ in more consider
becaus in all the countri there is no on who is recogn as
superior to him and if thei yield obedi to anoth thei do it as
to a minist and offici and thei do not bear him ani particular
affect
the exampl of these two govern in our time ar the turk and the
king of franc the entir monarchi of the turk is govern by on
lord the other ar hi servant and divid hi kingdom into
sanjak he send there differ administr and shift and
chang them as he choos but the king of franc is place in the
midst of an ancient bodi of lord acknowledg by their own subject
and belov by them thei have their own prerog nor can the king
take these awai except at hi peril therefor he who consid both
of these state will recogn great difficulti in seiz the state
of the turk but onc it is conquer great eas in hold it the
caus of the difficulti in seiz the kingdom of the turk ar that
the usurp cannot be call in by the princ of the kingdom nor can
he hope to be assist in hi design by the revolt of those whom the
lord ha around him thi aris from the reason given abov for hi
minist be all slave and bondmen can onli be corrupt with
great difficulti and on can expect littl advantag from them when
thei have been corrupt as thei cannot carri the peopl with them
for the reason assign henc he who attack the turk must bear in
mind that he will find him unit and he will have to reli more on hi
own strength than on the revolt of other but if onc the turk ha
been conquer and rout in the field in such a wai that he cannot
replac hi armi there is noth to fear but the famili of thi
princ and thi be extermin there remain no on to fear the
other have no credit with the peopl and as the conqueror did not
reli on them befor hi victori so he ought not to fear them after it
the contrari happen in kingdom govern like that of franc becaus
on can easili enter there by gain over some baron of the kingdom
for on alwai find malcont and such as desir a chang such men
for the reason given can open the wai into the state and render the
victori easi but if you wish to hold it afterward you meet with
infinit difficulti both from those who have assist you and from
those you have crush nor is it enough for you to have extermin
the famili of the princ becaus the lord that remain make themselv
the head of fresh movement against you and as you ar unabl either
to satisfi or extermin them that state is lost whenev time bring
the opportun
now if you will consid what wa the natur of the govern of
dariu you will find it similar to the kingdom of the turk and
therefor it wa onli necessari for alexand first to overthrow him
in the field and then to take the countri from him after which
victori dariu be kill the state remain secur to alexand
for the abov reason and if hi successor had been unit thei would
have enjoi it secur and at their eas for there were no tumult
rais in the kingdom except those thei provok themselv
but it is imposs to hold with such tranquil state constitut
like that of franc henc aros those frequent rebellion against the
roman in spain franc and greec ow to the mani princip
there were in these state of which as long as the memori of them
endur the roman alwai held an insecur possess but with the
power and long continu of the empir the memori of them pass
awai and the roman then becam secur possessor and when fight
afterward amongst themselv each on wa abl to attach to himself
hi own part of the countri accord to the author he had assum
there and the famili of the former lord be extermin none other
than the roman were acknowledg
when these thing ar rememb no on will marvel at the eas with
which alexand held the empir of asia or at the difficulti which
other have had to keep an acquisit such as pyrrhu and mani more
thi is not occas by the littl or abund of abil in the
conqueror but by the want of uniform in the subject state
chapter v
concern the wai to govern citi or princip which live under
their own law befor thei were annex
whenev those state which have been acquir as state have been
accustom to live under their own law and in freedom there ar three
cours for those who wish to hold them the first is to ruin them the
next is to resid there in person the third is to permit them to live
under their own law draw a tribut and establish within it an
oligarchi which will keep it friendli to you becaus such a
govern be creat by the princ know that it cannot stand
without hi friendship and interest and doe it utmost to support
him and therefor he who would keep a citi accustom to freedom will
hold it more easili by the mean of it own citizen than in ani other
wai
there ar for exampl the spartan and the roman the spartan held
athen and thebe establish there an oligarchi nevertheless thei
lost them the roman in order to hold capua carthag and numantia
dismantl them and did not lose them thei wish to hold greec as
the spartan held it make it free and permit it law and did
not succe so to hold it thei were compel to dismantl mani citi
in the countri for in truth there is no safe wai to retain them
otherwis than by ruin them and he who becom master of a citi
accustom to freedom and doe not destroi it mai expect to be
destroi by it for in rebellion it ha alwai the watchword of
liberti and it ancient privileg as a ralli point which neither
time nor benefit will ever caus it to forget and whatev you mai do
or provid against thei never forget that name or their privileg
unless thei ar disunit or dispers but at everi chanc thei
immedi ralli to them as pisa after the hundr year she had been
held in bondag by the florentin
but when citi or countri ar accustom to live under a princ and
hi famili is extermin thei be on the on hand accustom to
obei and on the other hand not have the old princ cannot agre in
make on from amongst themselv and thei do not know how to govern
themselv for thi reason thei ar veri slow to take up arm and a
princ can gain them to himself and secur them much more easili but
in republ there is more vital greater hatr and more desir
for vengeanc which will never permit them to allow the memori of
their former liberti to rest so that the safest wai is to destroi them
or to resid there
chapter vi
concern new princip which ar acquir by on own arm and
abil
let no on be surpris if in speak of entir new princip
as i shall do i adduc the highest exampl both of princ and of
state becaus men walk almost alwai in path beaten by other
and follow by imit their deed ar yet unabl to keep entir
to the wai of other or attain to the power of those thei imit a
wise man ought alwai to follow the path beaten by great men and to
imit those who have been suprem so that if hi abil doe not
equal their at least it will savour of it let him act like the
clever archer who design to hit the mark which yet appear too far
distant and know the limit to which the strength of their bow
attain take aim much higher than the mark not to reach by their
strength or arrow to so great a height but to be abl with the aid of
so high an aim to hit the mark thei wish to reach
i sai therefor that in entir new princip where there is a
new princ more or less difficulti is found in keep them
accordingli as there is more or less abil in him who ha acquir
the state now as the fact of becom a princ from a privat station
presuppos either abil or fortun it is clear that on or other of
these thing will mitig in some degre mani difficulti
nevertheless he who ha reli least on fortun is establish the
strongest further it facilit matter when the princ have no
other state is compel to resid there in person
but to come to those who by their own abil and not through fortun
have risen to be princ i sai that mose cyru romulu theseu
and such like ar the most excel exampl and although on mai not
discuss mose he have been a mere executor of the will of god yet
he ought to be admir if onli for that favour which made him worthi
to speak with god but in consid cyru and other who have
acquir or found kingdom all will be found admir and if their
particular deed and conduct shall be consid thei will not be
found inferior to those of mose although he had so great a preceptor
and in examin their action and live on cannot see that thei ow
anyth to fortun beyond opportun which brought them the materi
to mould into the form which seem best to them without that
opportun their power of mind would have been extinguish and
without those power the opportun would have come in vain
it wa necessari therefor to mose that he should find the peopl of
israel in egypt enslav and oppress by the egyptian in order that
thei should be dispos to follow him so as to be deliv out of
bondag it wa necessari that romulu should not remain in alba and
that he should be abandon at hi birth in order that he should
becom king of rome and founder of the fatherland it wa necessari
that cyru should find the persian discont with the govern of
the mede and the mede soft and effemin through their long peac
theseu could not have shown hi abil had he not found the athenian
dispers these opportun therefor made those men fortun
and their high abil enabl them to recogn the opportun
wherebi their countri wa ennobl and made famou
those who by valor wai becom princ like these men acquir a
princip with difficulti but thei keep it with eas the
difficulti thei have in acquir it rise in part from the new rule
and method which thei ar forc to introduc to establish their
govern and it secur and it ought to be rememb that there
is noth more difficult to take in hand more peril to conduct or
more uncertain in it success than to take the lead in the
introduct of a new order of thing becaus the innov ha for
enemi all those who have done well under the old condit and
lukewarm defend in those who mai do well under the new thi
cool aris partli from fear of the oppon who have the law on
their side and partli from the incredul of men who do not readili
believ in new thing until thei have had a long experi of them
thu it happen that whenev those who ar hostil have the
opportun to attack thei do it like partisan whilst the other
defend lukewarmli in such wise that the princ is endang along
with them
it is necessari therefor if we desir to discuss thi matter
thoroughli to inquir whether these innov can reli on themselv
or have to depend on other that is to sai whether to consumm
their enterpris have thei to us prayer or can thei us forc in
the first instanc thei alwai succe badli and never compass
anyth but when thei can reli on themselv and us forc then thei
ar rare endang henc it is that all arm prophet have
conquer and the unarm on have been destroi besid the
reason mention the natur of the peopl is variabl and whilst it
is easi to persuad them it is difficult to fix them in that
persuas and thu it is necessari to take such measur that when
thei believ no longer it mai be possibl to make them believ by
forc
if mose cyru theseu and romulu had been unarm thei could not
have enforc their constitut for longa happen in our time to
fra girolamo savonarola who wa ruin with hi new order of thing
immedi the multitud believ in him no longer and he had no
mean of keep steadfast those who believ or of make the
unbeliev to believ therefor such as these have great difficulti
in consumm their enterpris for all their danger ar in the
ascent yet with abil thei will overcom them but when these ar
overcom and those who envi them their success ar extermin
thei will begin to be respect and thei will continu afterward
power secur honour and happi
to these great exampl i wish to add a lesser on still it bear some
resembl to them and i wish it to suffic me for all of a like
kind it is hiero the syracusan1 thi man rose from a privat
station to be princ of syracus nor did he either ow anyth to
fortun but opportun for the syracusan be oppress chose him
for their captain afterward he wa reward by be made their
princ he wa of so great abil even as a privat citizen that on
who write of him sai he want noth but a kingdom to be a king
thi man abolish the old soldieri organ the new gave up old
allianc made new on and as he had hi own soldier and alli on
such foundat he wa abl to build ani edific thu whilst he had
endur much troubl in acquir he had but littl in keep

concern new princip which ar acquir either by the arm of
other or by good fortun
those who sole by good fortun becom princ from be privat
citizen have littl troubl in rise but much in keep atop thei
have not ani difficulti on the wai up becaus thei fly but thei
have mani when thei reach the summit such ar those to whom some state

concern these two method of rise to be a princ by abil or
fortun i wish to adduc two exampl within our own recollect and
these ar francesco sforza2 and cesar borgia francesco by proper
mean and with great abil from be a privat person rose to be
duke of milan and that which he had acquir with a thousand anxieti
he kept with littl troubl on the other hand cesar borgia call
by the peopl duke valentino acquir hi state dure the ascend
of hi father and on it declin he lost it notwithstand that he
had taken everi measur and done all that ought to be done by a wise
and abl man to fix firmli hi root in the state which the arm and
fortun of other had bestow on him
2 francesco sforza born 1401 di 1466 he marri bianca maria
visconti a natur daughter of filippo visconti the duke of milan
on whose death he procur hi own elev to the duchi machiavelli
wa the accredit agent of the florentin republ to cesar borgia
14781507 dure the transact which led up to the assassin
of the orsini and vitelli at sinigalia and along with hi letter to
hi chief in florenc he ha left an account written ten year
befor the princ of the proceed of the duke in hi
descrition del modo tenuto dal duca valentino nello ammazzar
vitellozzo vitelli etc a translat of which is append to the
present work
becaus as is state abov he who ha not first laid hi foundat
mai be abl with great abil to lai them afterward but thei will be
laid with troubl to the architect and danger to the build if
therefor all the step taken by the duke be consid it will be
seen that he laid solid foundat for hi futur power and i do not
consid it superflu to discuss them becaus i do not know what
better precept to give a new princ than the exampl of hi action
and if hi disposit were of no avail that wa not hi fault but
the extraordinari and extrem malign of fortun
alexand the sixth in wish to aggrand the duke hi son had
mani immedi and prospect difficulti firstli he did not see
hi wai to make him master of ani state that wa not a state of the
church and if he wa will to rob the church he knew that the duke
of milan and the venetian would not consent becaus faenza and rimini
were alreadi under the protect of the venetian besid thi he
saw the arm of itali especi those by which he might have been
assist in hand that would fear the aggrandiz of the pope
name the orsini and the colonnesi and their follow it behov
him therefor to upset thi state of affair and embroil the power
so as to make himself secur master of part of their state thi wa
easi for him to do becaus he found the venetian move by other
reason inclin to bring back the french into itali he would not
onli not oppos thi but he would render it more easi by dissolv
the former marriag of king loui therefor the king came into itali
with the assist of the venetian and the consent of alexand he
wa no sooner in milan than the pope had soldier from him for the
attempt on the romagna which yield to him on the reput of the
king the duke therefor have acquir the romagna and beaten the
colonnesi while wish to hold that and to advanc further wa
hinder by two thing the on hi forc did not appear loyal to
him the other the goodwil of franc that is to sai he fear that
the forc of the orsini which he wa us would not stand to him
that not onli might thei hinder him from win more but might
themselv seiz what he had won and that the king might also do the
same of the orsini he had a warn when after take faenza and
attack bologna he saw them go veri unwillingli to that attack and
as to the king he learn hi mind when he himself after take the
duchi of urbino attack tuscani and the king made him desist from
that undertak henc the duke decid to depend no more upon the
arm and the luck of other
for the first thing he weaken the orsini and colonnesi parti in
rome by gain to himself all their adher who were gentlemen
make them hi gentlemen give them good pai and accord to
their rank honour them with offic and command in such a wai that
in a few month all attach to the faction wa destroi and turn
entir to the duke after thi he await an opportun to crush the
orsini have scatter the adher of the colonna hous thi came
to him soon and he us it well for the orsini perceiv at length
that the aggrandiz of the duke and the church wa ruin to them
call a meet of the magion in perugia from thi sprung the
rebellion at urbino and the tumult in the romagna with endless
danger to the duke all of which he overcam with the help of the
french have restor hi author not to leav it at risk by
trust either to the french or other outsid forc he had recours
to hi wile and he knew so well how to conceal hi mind that by the
mediat of signor pagolowhom the duke did not fail to secur with
all kind of attent give him monei apparel and horsesth
orsini were reconcil so that their simplic brought them into hi
power at sinigalia3 have extermin the leader and turn
their partisan into hi friend the duke laid suffici good
foundat to hi power have all the romagna and the duchi of
urbino and the peopl now begin to appreci their prosper he
gain them all over to himself and as thi point is worthi of notic
and to be imit by other i am not will to leav it out
3 sinigalia 31st decemb 1502
when the duke occupi the romagna he found it under the rule of weak
master who rather plunder their subject than rule them and gave
them more caus for disunion than for union so that the countri wa
full of robberi quarrel and everi kind of violenc and so wish
to bring back peac and obedi to author he consid it
necessari to give it a good governor thereupon he promot messer
ramiro dorco4 a swift and cruel man to whom he gave the fullest
power thi man in a short time restor peac and uniti with the
greatest success afterward the duke consid that it wa not
advis to confer such excess author for he had no doubt but
that he would becom odiou so he set up a court of judgment in the
countri under a most excel presid wherein all citi had their
advoc and becaus he knew that the past sever had caus some
hatr against himself so to clear himself in the mind of the
peopl and gain them entir to himself he desir to show that if
ani cruelti had been practis it had not origin with him but in
the natur stern of the minist under thi pretenc he took
ramiro and on morn caus him to be execut and left on the
piazza at cesena with the block and a bloodi knife at hi side the
barbar of thi spectacl caus the peopl to be at onc satisfi
and dismai
4 ramiro dorco ramiro de lorqua
but let us return whenc we start i sai that the duke find
himself now suffici power and partli secur from immedi
danger by have arm himself in hi own wai and have in a great
measur crush those forc in hi vicin that could injur him if
he wish to proce with hi conquest had next to consid franc
for he knew that the king who too late wa awar of hi mistak would
not support him and from thi time he began to seek new allianc and
to tempor with franc in the expedit which she wa make toward
the kingdom of napl against the spaniard who were besieg gaeta
it wa hi intent to secur himself against them and thi he would
have quickli accomplish had alexand live
such wa hi line of action as to present affair but as to the futur
he had to fear in the first place that a new successor to the church
might not be friendli to him and might seek to take from him that which
alexand had given him so he decid to act in four wai firstli by
extermin the famili of those lord whom he had despoil so as
to take awai that pretext from the pope secondli by win to
himself all the gentlemen of rome so as to be abl to curb the pope
with their aid as ha been observ thirdli by convert the
colleg more to himself fourthli by acquir so much power befor
the pope should die that he could by hi own measur resist the first
shock of these four thing at the death of alexand he had
accomplish three for he had kill as mani of the dispossess lord
as he could lai hand on and few had escap he had won over the
roman gentlemen and he had the most numer parti in the colleg and
as to ani fresh acquisit he intend to becom master of tuscani
for he alreadi possess perugia and piombino and pisa wa under hi
protect and as he had no longer to studi franc for the french
were alreadi driven out of the kingdom of napl by the spaniard and
in thi wai both were compel to bui hi goodwil he pounc down
upon pisa after thi lucca and siena yield at onc partli through
hatr and partli through fear of the florentin and the florentin
would have had no remedi had he continu to prosper as he wa
prosper the year that alexand di for he had acquir so much
power and reput that he would have stood by himself and no longer
have depend on the luck and the forc of other but sole on hi
own power and abil
but alexand di five year after he had first drawn the sword he
left the duke with the state of romagna alon consolid with the
rest in the air between two most power hostil armi and sick
unto death yet there were in the duke such bold and abil and
he knew so well how men ar to be won or lost and so firm were the
foundat which in so short a time he had laid that if he had not
had those armi on hi back or if he had been in good health he
would have overcom all difficulti and it is seen that hi
foundat were good for the romagna await him for more than a
month in rome although but half aliv he remain secur and whilst
the baglioni the vitelli and the orsini might come to rome thei
could not effect anyth against him if he could not have made pope
him whom he wish at least the on whom he did not wish would not
have been elect but if he had been in sound health at the death of
alexander5 everyth would have been differ to him on the dai
that juliu the second6 wa elect he told me that he had thought
of everyth that might occur at the death of hi father and had
provid a remedi for all except that he had never anticip that
when the death did happen he himself would be on the point to die
5 alexand vi di of fever 18th august 1503
6 juliu ii wa giuliano della rover cardin of san pietro ad
vincula born 1443 di 1513
when all the action of the duke ar recal i do not know how to
blame him but rather it appear to be as i have said that i ought to
offer him for imit to all those who by the fortun or the arm of
other ar rais to govern becaus he have a lofti spirit and
farreach aim could not have regul hi conduct otherwis and
onli the short of the life of alexand and hi own sick
frustrat hi design therefor he who consid it necessari to
secur himself in hi new princip to win friend to overcom
either by forc or fraud to make himself belov and fear by the
peopl to be follow and rever by the soldier to extermin
those who have power or reason to hurt him to chang the old order of
thing for new to be sever and graciou magnanim and liber to
destroi a disloy soldieri and to creat new to maintain friendship
with king and princ in such a wai that thei must help him with zeal
and offend with caution cannot find a more live exampl than the
action of thi man
onli can he be blame for the elect of juliu the second in whom he
made a bad choic becaus as is said not be abl to elect a pope
to hi own mind he could have hinder ani other from be elect
pope and he ought never to have consent to the elect of ani
cardin whom he had injur or who had caus to fear him if thei
becam pontiff for men injur either from fear or hatr those whom
he had injur amongst other were san pietro ad vincula colonna
san giorgio and ascanio7 the rest in becom pope had to fear
him rouen and the spaniard except the latter from their
relationship and oblig the former from hi influenc the
kingdom of franc have relat with him therefor abov
everyth the duke ought to have creat a spaniard pope and
fail him he ought to have consent to rouen and not san pietro ad
vincula he who believ that new benefit will caus great personag
to forget old injuri is deceiv therefor the duke er in hi
choic and it wa the caus of hi ultim ruin

chapter viii
concern those who have obtain a princip by wicked
although a princ mai rise from a privat station in two wai neither
of which can be entir attribut to fortun or geniu yet it is
manifest to me that i must not be silent on them although on could be
more copious treat when i discuss republ these method ar
when either by some wick or nefari wai on ascend to the
princip or when by the favour of hi fellowcitizen a privat
person becom the princ of hi countri and speak of the first
method it will be illustr by two exampleson ancient the other
modernand without enter further into the subject i consid these
two exampl will suffic those who mai be compel to follow them
agathocl the sicilian1 becam king of syracus not onli from a
privat but from a low and abject posit thi man the son of a
potter through all the chang in hi fortun alwai led an infam
life nevertheless he accompani hi infami with so much abil of
mind and bodi that have devot himself to the militari profess
he rose through it rank to be praetor of syracus be establish
in that posit and have deliber resolv to make himself
princ and to seiz by violenc without oblig to other that
which had been conced to him by assent he came to an understand
for thi purpos with amilcar the carthaginian who with hi armi
wa fight in sicili on morn he assembl the peopl and the
senat of syracus as if he had to discuss with them thing relat
to the republ and at a given signal the soldier kill all the
senat and the richest of the peopl these dead he seiz and held
the princedom of that citi without ani civil commot and although he
wa twice rout by the carthaginian and ultim besieg yet not
onli wa he abl to defend hi citi but leav part of hi men for
it defenc with the other he attack africa and in a short time
rais the sieg of syracus the carthaginian reduc to extrem
necess were compel to come to term with agathocl and
leav sicili to him had to be content with the possess of africa
1 agathocl the sicilian born 361 bc di 289 bc
therefor he who consid the action and the geniu of thi man will
see noth or littl which can be attribut to fortun inasmuch as
he attain preemin as is shown abov not by the favour of ani
on but step by step in the militari profess which step were
gain with a thousand troubl and peril and were afterward boldli
held by him with mani hazard danger yet it cannot be call talent
to slai fellowcitizen to deceiv friend to be without faith
without merci without religion such method mai gain empir but not
glori still if the courag of agathocl in enter into and
extric himself from danger be consid togeth with hi
great of mind in endur and overcom hardship it cannot be
seen why he should be esteem less than the most notabl captain
nevertheless hi barbar cruelti and inhuman with infinit
wicked do not permit him to be celebr among the most excel
men what he achiev cannot be attribut either to fortun or geniu
in our time dure the rule of alexand the sixth oliverotto da
fermo have been left an orphan mani year befor wa brought up by
hi matern uncl giovanni fogliani and in the earli dai of hi
youth sent to fight under pagolo vitelli that be train under hi
disciplin he might attain some high posit in the militari
profess after pagolo di he fought under hi brother vitellozzo
and in a veri short time be endow with wit and a vigor bodi
and mind he becam the first man in hi profess but it appear a
paltri thing to serv under other he resolv with the aid of some
citizen of fermo to whom the slaveri of their countri wa dearer than
it liberti and with the help of the vitelleschi to seiz fermo so
he wrote to giovanni fogliani that have been awai from home for mani
year he wish to visit him and hi citi and in some measur to look
upon hi patrimoni and although he had not labour to acquir
anyth except honour yet in order that the citizen should see he
had not spent hi time in vain he desir to come honour so would
be accompani by on hundr horsemen hi friend and retain and
he entreat giovanni to arrang that he should be receiv honour
by the fermian all of which would be not onli to hi honour but also
to that of giovanni himself who had brought him up
giovanni therefor did not fail in ani attent due to hi nephew
and he caus him to be honour receiv by the fermian and he
lodg him in hi own hous where have pass some dai and have
arrang what wa necessari for hi wick design oliverotto gave a
solemn banquet to which he invit giovanni fogliani and the chief of
fermo when the viand and all the other entertain that ar usual
in such banquet were finish oliverotto artfulli began certain grave
discours speak of the great of pope alexand and hi son
cesar and of their enterpris to which discours giovanni and
other answer but he rose at onc sai that such matter ought to
be discuss in a more privat place and he betook himself to a
chamber whither giovanni and the rest of the citizen went in after
him no sooner were thei seat than soldier issu from secret place
and slaughter giovanni and the rest after these murder oliverotto
mount on horseback rode up and down the town and besieg the chief
magistr in the palac so that in fear the peopl were forc to
obei him and to form a govern of which he made himself the
princ he kill all the malcont who were abl to injur him and
strengthen himself with new civil and militari ordin in such a
wai that in the year dure which he held the princip not onli
wa he secur in the citi of fermo but he had becom formid to all
hi neighbour and hi destruct would have been as difficult as
that of agathocl if he had not allow himself to be overreach by
cesar borgia who took him with the orsini and vitelli at sinigalia
as wa state abov thu on year after he had commit thi
parricid he wa strangl togeth with vitellozzo whom he had made
hi leader in valour and wicked
some mai wonder how it can happen that agathocl and hi like after
infinit treacheri and cruelti should live for long secur in hi
countri and defend himself from extern enemi and never be
conspir against by hi own citizen see that mani other by
mean of cruelti have never been abl even in peac time to hold
the state still less in the doubt time of war i believ that thi
follow from severities2 be badli or properli us those mai be
call properli us if of evil it is possibl to speak well that ar
appli at on blow and ar necessari to on secur and that ar
not persist in afterward unless thei can be turn to the advantag
of the subject the badli emploi ar those which notwithstand
thei mai be few in the commenc multipli with time rather than
decreas those who practis the first system ar abl by aid of god
or man to mitig in some degre their rule as agathocl did it is
imposs for those who follow the other to maintain themselv
2 mr burd suggest that thi word probabl come near the modern
equival of machiavelli thought when he speak of crudelta than
the more obviou cruelti
henc it is to be remark that in seiz a state the usurp ought
to examin close into all those injuri which it is necessari for
him to inflict and to do them all at on stroke so as not to have to
repeat them daili and thu by not unsettl men he will be abl to
reassur them and win them to himself by benefit he who doe
otherwis either from timid or evil advic is alwai compel to
keep the knife in hi hand neither can he reli on hi subject nor
can thei attach themselv to him ow to their continu and
repeat wrong for injuri ought to be done all at on time so
that be tast less thei offend less benefit ought to be given
littl by littl so that the flavour of them mai last longer
and abov all thing a princ ought to live amongst hi peopl in such
a wai that no unexpect circumst whether of good or evil shall
make him chang becaus if the necess for thi come in troubl
time you ar too late for harsh measur and mild on will not help
you for thei will be consid as forc from you and no on will be
under ani oblig to you for them
chapter ix
concern a civil princip
but come to the other pointwher a lead citizen becom the
princ of hi countri not by wicked or ani intoler violenc
but by the favour of hi fellow citizensthi mai be call a civil
princip nor is geniu or fortun altogeth necessari to attain
to it but rather a happi shrewd i sai then that such a
princip is obtain either by the favour of the peopl or by the
favour of the nobl becaus in all citi these two distinct parti
ar found and from thi it aris that the peopl do not wish to be
rule nor oppress by the nobl and the nobl wish to rule and
oppress the peopl and from these two opposit desir there aris in
citi on of three result either a princip selfgovern or
anarchi
a princip is creat either by the peopl or by the nobl
accordingli as on or other of them ha the opportun for the
nobl see thei cannot withstand the peopl begin to cry up the
reput of on of themselv and thei make him a princ so that
under hi shadow thei can give vent to their ambit the peopl
find thei cannot resist the nobl also cry up the reput of
on of themselv and make him a princ so as to be defend by hi
author he who obtain sovereignti by the assist of the nobl
maintain himself with more difficulti than he who come to it by the
aid of the peopl becaus the former find himself with mani around
him who consid themselv hi equal and becaus of thi he can
neither rule nor manag them to hi like but he who reach
sovereignti by popular favour find himself alon and ha none around
him or few who ar not prepar to obei him
besid thi on cannot by fair deal and without injuri to other
satisfi the nobl but you can satisfi the peopl for their object is
more righteou than that of the nobl the latter wish to oppress
while the former onli desir not to be oppress it is to be ad
also that a princ can never secur himself against a hostil peopl
becaus of there be too mani whilst from the nobl he can secur
himself as thei ar few in number the worst that a princ mai expect
from a hostil peopl is to be abandon by them but from hostil
nobl he ha not onli to fear abandon but also that thei will
rise against him for thei be in these affair more farse and
astut alwai come forward in time to save themselv and to obtain
favour from him whom thei expect to prevail further the princ is
compel to live alwai with the same peopl but he can do well
without the same nobl be abl to make and unmak them daili and
to give or take awai author when it pleas him
therefor to make thi point clearer i sai that the nobl ought to
be look at mainli in two wai that is to sai thei either shape
their cours in such a wai as bind them entir to your fortun or
thei do not those who so bind themselv and ar not rapaci ought
to be honour and love those who do not bind themselv mai be dealt
with in two wai thei mai fail to do thi through pusillanim and a
natur want of courag in which case you ought to make us of them
especi of those who ar of good counsel and thu whilst in
prosper you honour them in advers you do not have to fear them
but when for their own ambiti end thei shun bind themselv it
is a token that thei ar give more thought to themselv than to you
and a princ ought to guard against such and to fear them as if thei
were open enemi becaus in advers thei alwai help to ruin him
therefor on who becom a princ through the favour of the peopl
ought to keep them friendli and thi he can easili do see thei onli
ask not to be oppress by him but on who in opposit to the
peopl becom a princ by the favour of the nobl ought abov
everyth to seek to win the peopl over to himself and thi he mai
easili do if he take them under hi protect becaus men when thei
receiv good from him of whom thei were expect evil ar bound more
close to their benefactor thu the peopl quickli becom more
devot to him than if he had been rais to the princip by their
favour and the princ can win their affect in mani wai but as
these vari accord to the circumst on cannot give fix rule
so i omit them but i repeat it is necessari for a princ to have the
peopl friendli otherwis he ha no secur in advers
nabis1 princ of the spartan sustain the attack of all greec
and of a victori roman armi and against them he defend hi
countri and hi govern and for the overcom of thi peril it wa
onli necessari for him to make himself secur against a few but thi
would not have been suffici had the peopl been hostil and do not
let ani on impugn thi statement with the trite proverb that he who
build on the peopl build on the mud for thi is true when a
privat citizen make a foundat there and persuad himself that
the peopl will free him when he is oppress by hi enemi or by the
magistr wherein he would find himself veri often deceiv as
happen to the gracchi in rome and to messer giorgio scali2 in
florenc but grant a princ who ha establish himself as abov
who can command and is a man of courag undismai in advers who
doe not fail in other qualif and who by hi resolut and
energi keep the whole peopl encouragedsuch a on will never find
himself deceiv in them and it will be shown that he ha laid hi
foundat well
1 nabi tyrant of sparta conquer by the roman under flamininu
in 195 bc kill 192 bc
2 messer giorgio scali thi event is to be found in machiavelli
florentin histori book iii
these princip ar liabl to danger when thei ar pass from
the civil to the absolut order of govern for such princ either
rule person or through magistr in the latter case their
govern is weaker and more insecur becaus it rest entir on
the goodwil of those citizen who ar rais to the magistraci and
who especi in troubl time can destroi the govern with
great eas either by intrigu or open defianc and the princ ha not
the chanc amid tumult to exercis absolut author becaus the
citizen and subject accustom to receiv order from magistr
ar not of a mind to obei him amid these confus and there will
alwai be in doubt time a scarciti of men whom he can trust for
such a princ cannot reli upon what he observ in quiet time when
citizen have need of the state becaus then everi on agre with
him thei all promis and when death is far distant thei all wish to
die for him but in troubl time when the state ha need of it
citizen then he find but few and so much the more is thi
experi danger inasmuch as it can onli be tri onc therefor
a wise princ ought to adopt such a cours that hi citizen will
alwai in everi sort and kind of circumst have need of the state
and of him and then he will alwai find them faith
chapter x
concern the wai in which the strength of all princip ought to
be measur
it is necessari to consid anoth point in examin the charact of
these princip that is whether a princ ha such power that in
case of need he can support himself with hi own resourc or whether
he ha alwai need of the assist of other and to make thi quit
clear i sai that i consid those who ar abl to support themselv by
their own resourc who can either by abund of men or monei rais
a suffici armi to join battl against ani on who come to attack
them and i consid those alwai to have need of other who cannot
show themselv against the enemi in the field but ar forc to
defend themselv by shelter behind wall the first case ha been
discuss but we will speak of it again should it recur in the second
case on can sai noth except to encourag such princ to provis
and fortifi their town and not on ani account to defend the countri
and whoever shall fortifi hi town well and shall have manag the
other concern of hi subject in the wai state abov and to be often
repeat will never be attack without great caution for men ar
alwai advers to enterpris where difficulti can be seen and it
will be seen not to be an easi thing to attack on who ha hi town
well fortifi and is not hate by hi peopl
the citi of germani ar absolut free thei own but littl countri
around them and thei yield obedi to the emperor when it suit
them nor do thei fear thi or ani other power thei mai have near them
becaus thei ar fortifi in such a wai that everi on think the
take of them by assault would be tediou and difficult see thei
have proper ditch and wall thei have suffici artilleri and thei
alwai keep in public depot enough for on year eat drink
and fire and beyond thi to keep the peopl quiet and without loss
to the state thei alwai have the mean of give work to the
commun in those labour that ar the life and strength of the citi
and on the pursuit of which the peopl ar support thei also hold
militari exercis in reput and moreov have mani ordin to
uphold them
therefor a princ who ha a strong citi and had not made himself
odiou will not be attack or if ani on should attack he will onli
be driven off with disgrac again becaus that the affair of thi
world ar so changeabl it is almost imposs to keep an armi a
whole year in the field without be interf with and whoever
should repli if the peopl have properti outsid the citi and see it
burnt thei will not remain patient and the long sieg and
selfinterest will make them forget their princ to thi i answer that
a power and courag princ will overcom all such difficulti by
give at on time hope to hi subject that the evil will not be for
long at anoth time fear of the cruelti of the enemi then preserv
himself adroitli from those subject who seem to him to be too bold
further the enemi would natur on hi arriv at onc burn and ruin
the countri at the time when the spirit of the peopl ar still hot
and readi for the defenc and therefor so much the less ought the
princ to hesit becaus after a time when spirit have cool the
damag is alreadi done the ill ar incur and there is no longer
ani remedi and therefor thei ar so much the more readi to unit with
their princ he appear to be under oblig to them now that
their hous have been burnt and their possess ruin in hi
defenc for it is the natur of men to be bound by the benefit thei
confer as much as by those thei receiv therefor if everyth is
well consid it will not be difficult for a wise princ to keep the
mind of hi citizen steadfast from first to last when he doe not
fail to support and defend them
chapter xi
concern ecclesiast princip
it onli remain now to speak of ecclesiast princip touch
which all difficulti ar prior to get possess becaus thei
ar acquir either by capac or good fortun and thei can be held
without either for thei ar sustain by the ancient ordin of
religion which ar so allpow and of such a charact that the
princip mai be held no matter how their princ behav and live
these princ alon have state and do not defend them and thei have
subject and do not rule them and the state although unguard ar
not taken from them and the subject although not rule do not care
and thei have neither the desir nor the abil to alien
themselv such princip onli ar secur and happi but be
upheld by power to which the human mind cannot reach i shall speak
no more of them becaus be exalt and maintain by god it would
be the act of a presumptu and rash man to discuss them
nevertheless if ani on should ask of me how come it that the church
ha attain such great in tempor power see that from
alexand backward the italian potent not onli those who have
been call potent but everi baron and lord though the smallest
have valu the tempor power veri slightlyyet now a king of franc
trembl befor it and it ha been abl to drive him from itali and
to ruin the venetiansalthough thi mai be veri manifest it doe not
appear to me superflu to recal it in some measur to memori
befor charl king of franc pass into italy1 thi countri wa
under the dominion of the pope the venetian the king of napl the
duke of milan and the florentin these potent had two princip
anxieti the on that no foreign should enter itali under arm
the other that none of themselv should seiz more territori those
about whom there wa the most anxieti were the pope and the venetian
to restrain the venetian the union of all the other wa necessari as
it wa for the defenc of ferrara and to keep down the pope thei made
us of the baron of rome who be divid into two faction orsini
and colonnesi had alwai a pretext for disord and stand with
arm in their hand under the ey of the pontiff kept the pontif
weak and powerless and although there might aris sometim a
courag pope such as sixtu yet neither fortun nor wisdom could
rid him of these annoy and the short life of a pope is also a
caus of weak for in the ten year which is the averag life of a
pope he can with difficulti lower on of the faction and if so to
speak on peopl should almost destroi the colonnesi anoth would
aris hostil to the orsini who would support their oppon and yet
would not have time to ruin the orsini thi wa the reason why the
tempor power of the pope were littl esteem in itali
1 charl viii invad itali in 1494
alexand the sixth aros afterward who of all the pontiff that have
ever been show how a pope with both monei and arm wa abl to
prevail and through the instrument of the duke valentino and by
reason of the entri of the french he brought about all those thing
which i have discuss abov in the action of the duke and although
hi intent wa not to aggrand the church but the duke
nevertheless what he did contribut to the great of the church
which after hi death and the ruin of the duke becam the heir to all
hi labour
pope juliu came afterward and found the church strong possess all
the romagna the baron of rome reduc to impot and through the
chastis of alexand the faction wipe out he also found the
wai open to accumul monei in a manner such as had never been
practis befor alexand time such thing juliu not onli
follow but improv upon and he intend to gain bologna to ruin
the venetian and to drive the french out of itali all of these
enterpris prosper with him and so much the more to hi credit
inasmuch as he did everyth to strengthen the church and not ani
privat person he kept also the orsini and colonnesi faction within
the bound in which he found them and although there wa among them
some mind to make disturb nevertheless he held two thing firm
the on the great of the church with which he terrifi them and
the other not allow them to have their own cardin who caus
the disord among them for whenev these faction have their

chapter xii
how mani kind of soldieri there ar and concern mercenari
have discours particularli on the characterist of such
princip as in the begin i propos to discuss and have
consid in some degre the caus of there be good or bad and
have shown the method by which mani have sought to acquir them and
to hold them it now remain for me to discuss gener the mean of
offenc and defenc which belong to each of them
we have seen abov how necessari it is for a princ to have hi
foundat well laid otherwis it follow of necess he will go to
ruin the chief foundat of all state new as well as old or
composit ar good law and good arm and as there cannot be good
law where the state is not well arm it follow that where thei ar
well arm thei have good law i shall leav the law out of the
discuss and shall speak of the arm
i sai therefor that the arm with which a princ defend hi state
ar either hi own or thei ar mercenari auxiliari or mix
mercenari and auxiliari ar useless and danger and if on hold
hi state base on these arm he will stand neither firm nor safe for
thei ar disunit ambiti and without disciplin unfaith
valiant befor friend cowardli befor enemi thei have neither the
fear of god nor fidel to men and destruct is defer onli so
long as the attack is for in peac on is rob by them and in war
by the enemi the fact is thei have no other attract or reason for
keep the field than a trifl of stipend which is not suffici to
make them will to die for you thei ar readi enough to be your
soldier whilst you do not make war but if war come thei take
themselv off or run from the foe which i should have littl troubl
to prove for the ruin of itali ha been caus by noth els than by
rest all her hope for mani year on mercenari and although thei
formerli made some displai and appear valiant amongst themselv yet
when the foreign came thei show what thei were thu it wa that
charl king of franc wa allow to seiz itali with chalk in
hand1 and he who told us that our sin were the caus of it told the
truth but thei were not the sin he imagin but those which i have
relat and as thei were the sin of princ it is the princ who
have also suffer the penalti
1 with chalk in hand col gesso thi is on of the bon mot
of alexand vi and refer to the eas with which charl viii seiz
itali impli that it wa onli necessari for him to send hi
quartermast to chalk up the billet for hi soldier to conquer the
countri cf the histori of henri vii by lord bacon king
charl had conquer the realm of napl and lost it again in a
kind of a felic of a dream he pass the whole length of itali
without resist so that it wa true what pope alexand wa wont
to sai that the frenchmen came into itali with chalk in their hand
to mark up their lodg rather than with sword to fight
i wish to demonstr further the infel of these arm the
mercenari captain ar either capabl men or thei ar not if thei ar
you cannot trust them becaus thei alwai aspir to their own
great either by oppress you who ar their master or other
contrari to your intent but if the captain is not skil you ar
ruin in the usual wai
and if it be urg that whoever is arm will act in the same wai
whether mercenari or not i repli that when arm have to be resort
to either by a princ or a republ then the princ ought to go in
person and perform the duti of a captain the republ ha to send it
citizen and when on is sent who doe not turn out satisfactorili it
ought to recal him and when on is worthi to hold him by the law so
that he doe not leav the command and experi ha shown princ
and republ singlehand make the greatest progress and
mercenari do noth except damag and it is more difficult to
bring a republ arm with it own arm under the swai of on of it
citizen than it is to bring on arm with foreign arm rome and
sparta stood for mani ag arm and free the switzer ar complet
arm and quit free
of ancient mercenari for exampl there ar the carthaginian who
were oppress by their mercenari soldier after the first war with the
roman although the carthaginian had their own citizen for captain
after the death of epaminonda philip of macedon wa made captain of
their soldier by the theban and after victori he took awai their
liberti
duke filippo be dead the milanes enlist francesco sforza against
the venetian and he have overcom the enemi at caravaggio2
alli himself with them to crush the milanes hi master hi
father sforza have been engag by queen johanna3 of napl left
her unprotect so that she wa forc to throw herself into the arm
of the king of aragon in order to save her kingdom and if the
venetian and florentin formerli extend their dominion by these
arm and yet their captain did not make themselv princ but have
defend them i repli that the florentin in thi case have been
favour by chanc for of the abl captain of whom thei might have
stood in fear some have not conquer some have been oppos and
other have turn their ambit elsewher on who did not conquer
wa giovanni acuto4 and sinc he did not conquer hi fidel cannot
be prove but everi on will acknowledg that had he conquer the
florentin would have stood at hi discret sforza had the
bracceschi alwai against him so thei watch each other francesco
turn hi ambit to lombardi braccio against the church and the
kingdom of napl but let us come to that which happen a short while
ago the florentin appoint as their captain pagolo vitelli a most
prudent man who from a privat posit had risen to the greatest
renown if thi man had taken pisa nobodi can deni that it would have
been proper for the florentin to keep in with him for if he becam
the soldier of their enemi thei had no mean of resist and if
thei held to him thei must obei him the venetian if their
achiev ar consid will be seen to have act safe and
glorious so long as thei sent to war their own men when with arm
gentlemen and plebian thei did valiantli thi wa befor thei turn
to enterpris on land but when thei began to fight on land thei
forsook thi virtu and follow the custom of itali and in the
begin of their expans on land through not have much
territori and becaus of their great reput thei had not much to
fear from their captain but when thei expand as under
carmignuola5 thei had a tast of thi mistak for have found him
a most valiant man thei beat the duke of milan under hi leadership
and on the other hand know how lukewarm he wa in the war thei
fear thei would no longer conquer under him and for thi reason thei
were not will nor were thei abl to let him go and so not to
lose again that which thei had acquir thei were compel in order
to secur themselv to murder him thei had afterward for their
captain bartolomeo da bergamo roberto da san severino the count of
pitigliano6 and the like under whom thei had to dread loss and not
gain as happen afterward at vaila7 where in on battl thei lost
that which in eight hundr year thei had acquir with so much
troubl becaus from such arm conquest come but slowli long delai
and inconsider but the loss sudden and portent

and as with these exampl i have reach itali which ha been rule
for mani year by mercenari i wish to discuss them more serious
in order that have seen their rise and progress on mai be better
prepar to counteract them you must understand that the empir ha
recent come to be repudi in itali that the pope ha acquir
more tempor power and that itali ha been divid up into more
state for the reason that mani of the great citi took up arm
against their nobl who formerli favour by the emperor were
oppress them whilst the church wa favour them so as to gain
author in tempor power in mani other their citizen becam
princ from thi it came to pass that itali fell partli into the
hand of the church and of republ and the church consist of
priest and the republ of citizen unaccustom to arm both
commenc to enlist foreign
the first who gave renown to thi soldieri wa alberigo da conio8
the romagnian from the school of thi man sprang among other
braccio and sforza who in their time were the arbit of itali after
these came all the other captain who till now have direct the arm
of itali and the end of all their valour ha been that she ha been
overrun by charl rob by loui ravag by ferdinand and insult
by the switzer the principl that ha guid them ha been first to
lower the credit of infantri so that thei might increas their own
thei did thi becaus subsist on their pai and without territori
thei were unabl to support mani soldier and a few infantri did not
give them ani author so thei were led to emploi cavalri with a
moder forc of which thei were maintain and honour and affair
were brought to such a pass that in an armi of twenti thousand
soldier there were not to be found two thousand foot soldier thei
had besid thi us everi art to lessen fatigu and danger to
themselv and their soldier not kill in the frai but take
prison and liber without ransom thei did not attack town at
night nor did the garrison of the town attack encamp at night
thei did not surround the camp either with stockad or ditch nor did
thei campaign in the winter all these thing were permit by their
militari rule and devis by them to avoid as i have said both
fatigu and danger thu thei have brought itali to slaveri and
contempt

concern auxiliari mix soldieri and on own

princ is call in with hi forc to aid and defend as wa done by
pope juliu in the most recent time for he have in the enterpris
against ferrara had poor proof of hi mercenari turn to
auxiliari and stipul with ferdinand king of spain1 for hi

and although ancient histori mai be full of exampl i do not wish
to leav thi recent on of pope juliu the second the peril of which
cannot fail to be perceiv for he wish to get ferrara threw
himself entir into the hand of the foreign but hi good fortun
brought about a third event so that he did not reap the fruit of hi
rash choic becaus have hi auxiliari rout at ravenna and the
switzer have risen and driven out the conqueror against all
expect both hi and other it so came to pass that he did not
becom prison to hi enemi thei have fled nor to hi
auxiliari he have conquer by other arm than their
the florentin be entir without arm sent ten thousand
frenchmen to take pisa wherebi thei ran more danger than at ani other

therefor let him who ha no desir to conquer make us of these arm
for thei ar much more hazard than mercenari becaus with them
the ruin is readi made thei ar all unit all yield obedi to
other but with mercenari when thei have conquer more time and
better opportun ar need to injur you thei ar not all of on
commun thei ar found and paid by you and a third parti which you
have made their head is not abl all at onc to assum enough
author to injur you in conclus in mercenari dastardi is most
danger in auxiliari valour the wise princ therefor ha
alwai avoid these arm and turn to hi own and ha been will
rather to lose with them than to conquer with the other not deem
that a real victori which is gain with the arm of other
i shall never hesit to cite cesar borgia and hi action thi duke
enter the romagna with auxiliari take there onli french
soldier and with them he captur imola and forli but afterward
such forc not appear to him reliabl he turn to mercenari
discern less danger in them and enlist the orsini and vitelli
whom present on handl and find them doubt unfaith and
danger he destroi and turn to hi own men and the differ
between on and the other of these forc can easili be seen when on
consid the differ there wa in the reput of the duke when
he had the french when he had the orsini and vitelli and when he
reli on hi own soldier on whose fidel he could alwai count and
found it ever increas he wa never esteem more highli than when
everi on saw that he wa complet master of hi own forc
i wa not intend to go beyond italian and recent exampl but i am
unwil to leav out hiero the syracusan he be on of those i
have name abov thi man as i have said made head of the armi by
the syracusan soon found out that a mercenari soldieri constitut
like our italian condottieri wa of no us and it appear to him
that he could neither keep them nor let them go he had them all cut to
piec and afterward made war with hi own forc and not with
alien
i wish also to recal to memori an instanc from the old testament
applic to thi subject david offer himself to saul to fight with
goliath the philistin champion and to give him courag saul arm
him with hi own weapon which david reject as soon as he had them
on hi back sai he could make no us of them and that he wish to
meet the enemi with hi sling and hi knife in conclus the arm of
other either fall from your back or thei weigh you down or thei bind
you fast

began to enlist the switzer which mistak follow by other is as
is now seen a sourc of peril to that kingdom becaus have rais
the reput of the switzer he ha entir diminish the valu of
hi own arm for he ha destroi the infantri altogeth and hi
menatarm he ha subordin to other for be as thei ar so
accustom to fight along with switzer it doe not appear that thei
can now conquer without them henc it aris that the french cannot
stand against the switzer and without the switzer thei do not come
off well against other the armi of the french have thu becom
mix partli mercenari and partli nation both of which arm
togeth ar much better than mercenari alon or auxiliari alon
but much inferior to on own forc and thi exampl prove it for

but the scanti wisdom of man on enter into an affair which look
well at first cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it as i
have said abov of hectic fever therefor if he who rule a
princip cannot recogn evil until thei ar upon him he is not
truli wise and thi insight is given to few and if the first disast
to the roman empire5 should be examin it will be found to have
commenc onli with the enlist of the goth becaus from that time
the vigour of the roman empir began to declin and all that valour
which had rais it pass awai to other
5 mani speaker to the hous the other night in the debat on the
reduct of armament seem to show a most lament ignor of
the condit under which the british empir maintain it exist
when mr balfour repli to the alleg that the roman empir sank
under the weight of it militari oblig he said that thi wa
wholli unhistor he might well have ad that the roman power
wa at it zenith when everi citizen acknowledg hi liabil to
fight for the state but that it began to declin as soon as thi
oblig wa no longer recognisedpal mall gazett 15th mai

i conclud therefor that no princip is secur without have
it own forc on the contrari it is entir depend on good
fortun not have the valour which in advers would defend it and
it ha alwai been the opinion and judgment of wise men that noth
can be so uncertain or unstabl as fame or power not found on it own
strength and on own forc ar those which ar compos either of
subject citizen or depend all other ar mercenari or
auxiliari and the wai to make readi on own forc will be easili
found if the rule suggest by me shall be reflect upon and if on
will consid how philip the father of alexand the great and mani
republ and princ have arm and organ themselv to which
rule i entir commit myself
chapter xiv
that which concern a princ on the subject of the art of war
a princ ought to have no other aim or thought nor select anyth
els for hi studi than war and it rule and disciplin for thi is
the sole art that belong to him who rule and it is of such forc
that it not onli uphold those who ar born princ but it often
enabl men to rise from a privat station to that rank and on the
contrari it is seen that when princ have thought more of eas than
of arm thei have lost their state and the first caus of your lose
it is to neglect thi art and what enabl you to acquir a state is
to be master of the art francesco sforza through be martial from
a privat person becam duke of milan and the son through avoid
the hardship and troubl of arm from duke becam privat person
for among other evil which be unarm bring you it caus you to
be despis and thi is on of those ignomini against which a princ
ought to guard himself as is shown later on becaus there is noth
proportion between the arm and the unarm and it is not
reason that he who is arm should yield obedi willingli to him
who is unarm or that the unarm man should be secur among arm
servant becaus there be in the on disdain and in the other
suspicion it is not possibl for them to work well togeth and
therefor a princ who doe not understand the art of war over and
abov the other misfortun alreadi mention cannot be respect by
hi soldier nor can he reli on them he ought never therefor to
have out of hi thought thi subject of war and in peac he should
addict himself more to it exercis than in war thi he can do in two
wai the on by action the other by studi
as regard action he ought abov all thing to keep hi men well
organ and drill to follow incessantli the chase by which he
accustom hi bodi to hardship and learn someth of the natur of
local and get to find out how the mountain rise how the
vallei open out how the plain lie and to understand the natur of
river and marsh and in all thi to take the greatest care which
knowledg is us in two wai firstli he learn to know hi
countri and is better abl to undertak it defenc afterward by
mean of the knowledg and observ of that local he understand
with eas ani other which it mai be necessari for him to studi
hereaft becaus the hill vallei and plain and river and
marsh that ar for instanc in tuscani have a certain resembl
to those of other countri so that with a knowledg of the aspect of
on countri on can easili arriv at a knowledg of other and the
princ that lack thi skill lack the essenti which it is desir
that a captain should possess for it teach him to surpris hi
enemi to select quarter to lead armi to arrai the battl to
besieg town to advantag
philopoemen1 princ of the achaean among other prais which
writer have bestow on him is commend becaus in time of peac he
never had anyth in hi mind but the rule of war and when he wa in
the countri with friend he often stop and reason with them if
the enemi should be upon that hill and we should find ourselv here
with our armi with whom would be the advantag how should on best
advanc to meet him keep the rank if we should wish to retreat
how ought we to pursu and he would set forth to them as he went
all the chanc that could befal an armi he would listen to their
opinion and state hi confirm it with reason so that by these
continu discuss there could never aris in time of war ani
unexpect circumst that he could not deal with
1 philopoemen the last of the greek born 252 bc di 183

but to exercis the intellect the princ should read histori and
studi there the action of illustri men to see how thei have born
themselv in war to examin the caus of their victori and defeat
so as to avoid the latter and imit the former and abov all do as
an illustri man did who took as an exemplar on who had been
prais and famou befor him and whose achiev and deed he
alwai kept in hi mind as it is said alexand the great imit
achil caesar alexand scipio cyru and whoever read the life of
cyru written by xenophon will recogn afterward in the life of
scipio how that imit wa hi glori and how in chastiti
affabl human and liber scipio conform to those thing
which have been written of cyru by xenophon a wise princ ought to
observ some such rule and never in peac time stand idl but
increas hi resourc with industri in such a wai that thei mai be
avail to him in advers so that if fortun chanc it mai find
him prepar to resist her blow
chapter xv
concern thing for which men and especi princ ar prais or
blame
it remain now to see what ought to be the rule of conduct for a
princ toward subject and friend and as i know that mani have
written on thi point i expect i shall be consid presumptu in
mention it again especi as in discuss it i shall depart from
the method of other peopl but it be my intent to write a
thing which shall be us to him who apprehend it it appear to me
more appropri to follow up the real truth of the matter than the
imagin of it for mani have pictur republ and princip
which in fact have never been known or seen becaus how on live is
so far distant from how on ought to live that he who neglect what is
done for what ought to be done sooner effect hi ruin than hi
preserv for a man who wish to act entir up to hi
profess of virtu soon meet with what destroi him among so much
that is evil
henc it is necessari for a princ wish to hold hi own to know how
to do wrong and to make us of it or not accord to necess
therefor put on on side imaginari thing concern a princ
and discuss those which ar real i sai that all men when thei ar
spoken of and chiefli princ for be more highli place ar
remark for some of those qualiti which bring them either blame or
prais and thu it is that on is reput liber anoth miserli
us a tuscan term becaus an avarici person in our languag is
still he who desir to possess by robberi whilst we call on miserli
who depriv himself too much of the us of hi own on is reput
gener on rapaci on cruel on compassion on faithless
anoth faith on effemin and cowardli anoth bold and brave
on affabl anoth haughti on lascivi anoth chast on
sincer anoth cun on hard anoth easi on grave anoth
frivol on religi anoth unbeliev and the like and i know
that everi on will confess that it would be most praiseworthi in a
princ to exhibit all the abov qualiti that ar consid good but
becaus thei can neither be entir possess nor observ for human
condit do not permit it it is necessari for him to be suffici
prudent that he mai know how to avoid the reproach of those vice which
would lose him hi state and also to keep himself if it be possibl
from those which would not lose him it but thi not be possibl he
mai with less hesit abandon himself to them and again he need
not make himself uneasi at incur a reproach for those vice without
which the state can onli be save with difficulti for if everyth is
consid carefulli it will be found that someth which look like
virtu if follow would be hi ruin whilst someth els which
look like vice yet follow bring him secur and prosper
chapter xvi
concern liber and mean
commenc then with the first of the abovenam characterist i
sai that it would be well to be reput liber nevertheless
liber exercis in a wai that doe not bring you the reput
for it injur you for if on exercis it honestli and as it should
be exercis it mai not becom known and you will not avoid the
reproach of it opposit therefor ani on wish to maintain among
men the name of liber is oblig to avoid no attribut of
magnific so that a princ thu inclin will consum in such act
all hi properti and will be compel in the end if he wish to
maintain the name of liber to unduli weigh down hi peopl and tax
them and do everyth he can to get monei thi will soon make him
odiou to hi subject and becom poor he will be littl valu by
ani on thu with hi liber have offend mani and reward
few he is affect by the veri first troubl and imperil by
whatev mai be the first danger recogn thi himself and wish
to draw back from it he run at onc into the reproach of be
miserli
therefor a princ not be abl to exercis thi virtu of
liber in such a wai that it is recogn except to hi cost if
he is wise he ought not to fear the reput of be mean for in
time he will come to be more consid than if liber see that
with hi economi hi revenu ar enough that he can defend himself
against all attack and is abl to engag in enterpris without
burden hi peopl thu it come to pass that he exercis
liber toward all from whom he doe not take who ar numberless
and mean toward those to whom he doe not give who ar few
we have not seen great thing done in our time except by those who have
been consid mean the rest have fail pope juliu the second wa
assist in reach the papaci by a reput for liber yet he
did not strive afterward to keep it up when he made war on the king
of franc and he made mani war without impos ani extraordinari tax
on hi subject for he suppli hi addit expens out of hi
long thrifti the present king of spain would not have undertaken
or conquer in so mani enterpris if he had been reput liber a
princ therefor provid that he ha not to rob hi subject that
he can defend himself that he doe not becom poor and abject that he
is not forc to becom rapaci ought to hold of littl account a
reput for be mean for it is on of those vice which will
enabl him to govern
and if ani on should sai caesar obtain empir by liber and
mani other have reach the highest posit by have been liber
and by be consid so i answer either you ar a princ in fact
or in a wai to becom on in the first case thi liber is
danger in the second it is veri necessari to be consid liber
and caesar wa on of those who wish to becom preemin in rome
but if he had surviv after becom so and had not moder hi
expens he would have destroi hi govern and if ani on should
repli mani have been princ and have done great thing with armi
who have been consid veri liber i repli either a princ spend
that which is hi own or hi subject or els that of other in the
first case he ought to be spare in the second he ought not to
neglect ani opportun for liber and to the princ who goe
forth with hi armi support it by pillag sack and extort
handl that which belong to other thi liber is necessari
otherwis he would not be follow by soldier and of that which is
neither your nor your subject you can be a readi giver as were
cyru caesar and alexand becaus it doe not take awai your
reput if you squander that of other but add to it it is onli
squander your own that injur you
and there is noth wast so rapidli as liber for even whilst
you exercis it you lose the power to do so and so becom either poor
or despis or els in avoid poverti rapaci and hate and a
princ should guard himself abov all thing against be despis
and hate and liber lead you to both therefor it is wiser to
have a reput for mean which bring reproach without hatr
than to be compel through seek a reput for liber to
incur a name for rapac which beget reproach with hatr
chapter xvii
concern cruelti and clemenc and whether it is better to be love
than fear
come now to the other qualiti mention abov i sai that everi
princ ought to desir to be consid clement and not cruel
nevertheless he ought to take care not to misus thi clemenc cesar
borgia wa consid cruel notwithstand hi cruelti reconcil
the romagna unifi it and restor it to peac and loyalti and if
thi be rightli consid he will be seen to have been much more
merci than the florentin peopl who to avoid a reput for
cruelti permit pistoia to be destroyed1 therefor a princ so
long as he keep hi subject unit and loyal ought not to mind the
reproach of cruelti becaus with a few exampl he will be more
merci than those who through too much merci allow disord to
aris from which follow murder or robberi for these ar wont to
injur the whole peopl whilst those execut which origin with a
princ offend the individu onli

upon thi a question aris whether it be better to be love than
fear or fear than love it mai be answer that on should wish to
be both but becaus it is difficult to unit them in on person it
is much safer to be fear than love when of the two either must be
dispens with becaus thi is to be assert in gener of men that
thei ar ungrat fickl fals cowardli covet and as long as
you succe thei ar your entir thei will offer you their blood
properti life and children as is said abov when the need is far
distant but when it approach thei turn against you and that princ
who reli entir on their promis ha neglect other
precaut is ruin becaus friendship that ar obtain by
payment and not by great or nobil of mind mai inde be
earn but thei ar not secur and in time of need cannot be reli
upon and men have less scrupl in offend on who is belov than
on who is fear for love is preserv by the link of oblig
which ow to the base of men is broken at everi opportun for
their advantag but fear preserv you by a dread of punish which
never fail
nevertheless a princ ought to inspir fear in such a wai that if he
doe not win love he avoid hatr becaus he can endur veri well
be fear whilst he is not hate which will alwai be as long as he
abstain from the properti of hi citizen and subject and from their
women but when it is necessari for him to proce against the life of
someon he must do it on proper justif and for manifest caus
but abov all thing he must keep hi hand off the properti of other
becaus men more quickli forget the death of their father than the loss
of their patrimoni besid pretext for take awai the properti ar
never want for he who ha onc begun to live by robberi will alwai
find pretext for seiz what belong to other but reason for
take life on the contrari ar more difficult to find and sooner
laps but when a princ is with hi armi and ha under control a
multitud of soldier then it is quit necessari for him to disregard
the reput of cruelti for without it he would never hold hi armi
unit or dispos to it duti
among the wonder deed of hannib thi on is enumer that
have led an enorm armi compos of mani variou race of men to
fight in foreign land no dissens aros either among them or
against the princ whether in hi bad or in hi good fortun thi
aros from noth els than hi inhuman cruelti which with hi
boundless valour made him rever and terribl in the sight of hi
soldier but without that cruelti hi other virtu were not
suffici to produc thi effect and shortsight writer admir hi
deed from on point of view and from anoth condemn the princip
caus of them that it is true hi other virtu would not have been
suffici for him mai be prove by the case of scipio that most
excel man not onli of hi own time but within the memori of man
against whom nevertheless hi armi rebel in spain thi aros from
noth but hi too great forbear which gave hi soldier more
licens than is consist with militari disciplin for thi he wa
upbraid in the senat by fabiu maximu and call the corrupt of
the roman soldieri the locrian were laid wast by a legat of scipio
yet thei were not aveng by him nor wa the insol of the legat
punish ow entir to hi easi natur insomuch that someon in
the senat wish to excus him said there were mani men who knew
much better how not to err than to correct the error of other thi
disposit if he had been continu in the command would have
destroi in time the fame and glori of scipio but he be under the
control of the senat thi injuri characterist not onli conceal
itself but contribut to hi glori
return to the question of be fear or love i come to the
conclus that men love accord to their own will and fear
accord to that of the princ a wise princ should establish himself
on that which is in hi own control and not in that of other he must
endeavour onli to avoid hatr as is note
chapter xviii1
concern the wai in which princ should keep faith
1 the present chapter ha given greater offenc than ani other
portion of machiavelli write burd il princip p 297
everi on admit how praiseworthi it is in a princ to keep faith and
to live with integr and not with craft nevertheless our experi
ha been that those princ who have done great thing have held good
faith of littl account and have known how to circumv the intellect
of men by craft and in the end have overcom those who have reli on
their word you must know there ar two wai of contesting2 the on
by the law the other by forc the first method is proper to men the
second to beast but becaus the first is frequent not suffici
it is necessari to have recours to the second therefor it is
necessari for a princ to understand how to avail himself of the beast
and the man thi ha been figur taught to princ by ancient
writer who describ how achil and mani other princ of old were
given to the centaur chiron to nurs who brought them up in hi
disciplin which mean sole that as thei had for a teacher on who
wa half beast and half man so it is necessari for a princ to know
how to make us of both natur and that on without the other is not
durabl a princ therefor be compel knowingli to adopt the
beast ought to choos the fox and the lion becaus the lion cannot
defend himself against snare and the fox cannot defend himself against
wolv therefor it is necessari to be a fox to discov the snare
and a lion to terrifi the wolv those who reli simpli on the lion do
not understand what thei ar about therefor a wise lord cannot nor
ought he to keep faith when such observ mai be turn against him
and when the reason that caus him to pledg it exist no longer if
men were entir good thi precept would not hold but becaus thei
ar bad and will not keep faith with you you too ar not bound to
observ it with them nor will there ever be want to a princ
legitim reason to excus thi nonobserv of thi endless
modern exampl could be given show how mani treati and
engag have been made void and of no effect through the
faithless of princ and he who ha known best how to emploi the
fox ha succeed best

nam cum sint duo genera decertandi unum per disceptationem alterum

est ad posteriu si uti non licet superior
but it is necessari to know well how to disguis thi characterist
and to be a great pretend and dissembl and men ar so simpl and
so subject to present necess that he who seek to deceiv will
alwai find someon who will allow himself to be deceiv on recent
exampl i cannot pass over in silenc alexand the sixth did noth
els but deceiv men nor ever thought of do otherwis and he
alwai found victim for there never wa a man who had greater power
in assert or who with greater oath would affirm a thing yet would
observ it less nevertheless hi deceit alwai succeed accord to
hi wishes3 becaus he well understood thi side of mankind

italian proverb
therefor it is unnecessari for a princ to have all the good qualiti
i have enumer but it is veri necessari to appear to have them and
i shall dare to sai thi also that to have them and alwai to observ
them is injuri and that to appear to have them is us to appear
merci faith human religi upright and to be so but with
a mind so frame that should you requir not to be so you mai be abl
and know how to chang to the opposit
and you have to understand thi that a princ especi a new on
cannot observ all those thing for which men ar esteem be often
forc in order to maintain the state to act contrari to fidelity4
friendship human and religion therefor it is necessari for him
to have a mind readi to turn itself accordingli as the wind and
variat of fortun forc it yet as i have said abov not to
diverg from the good if he can avoid do so but if compel then
to know how to set about it
4 contrari to fidel or faith contro alla fede and tutto
fede altogeth faith in the next paragraph it is noteworthi
that these two phrase contro alla fede and tutto fede were
omit in the testina edit which wa publish with the sanction
of the papal author it mai be that the mean attach to the
word fede wa the faith ie the cathol creed and not as
render here fidel and faith observ that the word
religion wa suffer to stand in the text of the testina be
us to signifi indiffer everi shade of belief as wit the
religion a phrase inevit emploi to design the huguenot
heresi south in hi sermon ix p 69 ed 1843 comment on thi
passag as follow that great patron and coryphaeu of thi tribe
nicolo machiavel laid down thi for a master rule in hi polit
scheme that the show of religion wa help to the politician but
the realiti of it hurt and pernici
for thi reason a princ ought to take care that he never let anyth
slip from hi lip that is not replet with the abovenam five
qualiti that he mai appear to him who see and hear him altogeth
merci faith human upright and religi there is noth
more necessari to appear to have than thi last qualiti inasmuch as
men judg gener more by the ey than by the hand becaus it
belong to everybodi to see you to few to come in touch with you
everi on see what you appear to be few realli know what you ar and
those few dare not oppos themselv to the opinion of the mani who
have the majesti of the state to defend them and in the action of all
men and especi of princ which it is not prudent to challeng
on judg by the result
for that reason let a princ have the credit of conquer and hold
hi state the mean will alwai be consid honest and he will be
prais by everybodi becaus the vulgar ar alwai taken by what a
thing seem to be and by what come of it and in the world there ar
onli the vulgar for the few find a place there onli when the mani have
no ground to rest on
on prince5 of the present time whom it is not well to name never
preach anyth els but peac and good faith and to both he is most
hostil and either if he had kept it would have depriv him of
reput and kingdom mani a time

chapter xix
that on should avoid be despis and hate
now concern the characterist of which mention is made abov i
have spoken of the more import on the other i wish to discuss
briefli under thi gener that the princ must consid as ha
been in part said befor how to avoid those thing which will make him
hate or contempt and as often as he shall have succeed he will
have fulfil hi part and he need not fear ani danger in other
reproach
it make him hate abov all thing as i have said to be rapaci
and to be a violat of the properti and women of hi subject from
both of which he must abstain and when neither their properti nor
their honor is touch the major of men live content and he ha
onli to contend with the ambit of a few whom he can curb with eas
in mani wai
it make him contempt to be consid fickl frivol
effemin meanspirit irresolut from all of which a princ
should guard himself as from a rock and he should endeavour to show in
hi action great courag graviti and fortitud and in hi
privat deal with hi subject let him show that hi judgment ar
irrevoc and maintain himself in such reput that no on can
hope either to deceiv him or to get round him
that princ is highli esteem who convei thi impress of himself
and he who is highli esteem is not easili conspir against for
provid it is well known that he is an excel man and rever by
hi peopl he can onli be attack with difficulti for thi reason a
princ ought to have two fear on from within on account of hi
subject the other from without on account of extern power from
the latter he is defend by be well arm and have good alli
and if he is well arm he will have good friend and affair will
alwai remain quiet within when thei ar quiet without unless thei
should have been alreadi disturb by conspiraci and even should
affair outsid be disturb if he ha carri out hi prepar
and ha live as i have said as long as he doe not despair he will
resist everi attack as i said nabi the spartan did
but concern hi subject when affair outsid ar disturb he ha
onli to fear that thei will conspir secretli from which a princ can
easili secur himself by avoid be hate and despis and by
keep the peopl satisfi with him which it is most necessari for
him to accomplish as i said abov at length and on of the most
efficaci remedi that a princ can have against conspiraci is not
to be hate and despis by the peopl for he who conspir against a
princ alwai expect to pleas them by hi remov but when the
conspir can onli look forward to offend them he will not have
the courag to take such a cours for the difficulti that confront a
conspir ar infinit and as experi show mani have been the
conspiraci but few have been success becaus he who conspir
cannot act alon nor can he take a companion except from those whom he
believ to be malcont and as soon as you have open your mind to
a malcont you have given him the materi with which to content
himself for by denounc you he can look for everi advantag so
that see the gain from thi cours to be assur and see the
other to be doubt and full of danger he must be a veri rare
friend or a thoroughli obstin enemi of the princ to keep faith
with you
and to reduc the matter into a small compass i sai that on the side
of the conspir there is noth but fear jealousi prospect of
punish to terrifi him but on the side of the princ there is the
majesti of the princip the law the protect of friend and
the state to defend him so that ad to all these thing the
popular goodwil it is imposs that ani on should be so rash as to
conspir for wherea in gener the conspir ha to fear befor the
execut of hi plot in thi case he ha also to fear the sequel to
the crime becaus on account of it he ha the peopl for an enemi and
thu cannot hope for ani escap
endless exampl could be given on thi subject but i will be content
with on brought to pass within the memori of our father messer
annibal bentivogli who wa princ in bologna grandfath of the
present annibal have been murder by the canneschi who had
conspir against him not on of hi famili surviv but messer
giovanni1 who wa in childhood immedi after hi assassin
the peopl rose and murder all the canneschi thi sprung from the
popular goodwil which the hous of bentivogli enjoi in those dai in
bologna which wa so great that although none remain there after
the death of annibal who wa abl to rule the state the bolognes
have inform that there wa on of the bentivogli famili in
florenc who up to that time had been consid the son of a
blacksmith sent to florenc for him and gave him the govern of
their citi and it wa rule by him until messer giovanni came in due
cours to the govern
1 giovanni bentivogli born in bologna 1438 di at milan 1508 he
rule bologna from 1462 to 1506 machiavelli strong condemn of
conspiraci mai get it edg from hi own veri recent experi
februari 1513 when he had been arrest and tortur for hi
alleg complic in the boscoli conspiraci
for thi reason i consid that a princ ought to reckon conspiraci
of littl account when hi peopl hold him in esteem but when it is
hostil to him and bear hatr toward him he ought to fear
everyth and everybodi and wellord state and wise princ have
taken everi care not to drive the nobl to desper and to keep
the peopl satisfi and content for thi is on of the most
import object a princ can have
among the best order and govern kingdom of our time is franc
and in it ar found mani good institut on which depend the liberti
and secur of the king of these the first is the parliament and it
author becaus he who found the kingdom know the ambit of
the nobil and their bold consid that a bit to their mouth
would be necessari to hold them in and on the other side know the
hatr of the peopl found in fear against the nobl he wish to
protect them yet he wa not anxiou for thi to be the particular care
of the king therefor to take awai the reproach which he would be
liabl to from the nobl for favour the peopl and from the peopl
for favour the nobl he set up an arbit who should be on who
could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the
king neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrang or
a greater sourc of secur to the king and kingdom from thi on can
draw anoth import conclus that princ ought to leav affair
of reproach to the manag of other and keep those of grace in
their own hand and further i consid that a princ ought to cherish
the nobl but not so as to make himself hate by the peopl
it mai appear perhap to some who have examin the live and death
of the roman emperor that mani of them would be an exampl contrari to
my opinion see that some of them live nobli and show great
qualiti of soul nevertheless thei have lost their empir or have
been kill by subject who have conspir against them wish
therefor to answer these object i will recal the charact of
some of the emperor and will show that the caus of their ruin were
not differ to those alleg by me at the same time i will onli
submit for consider those thing that ar noteworthi to him who
studi the affair of those time
it seem to me suffici to take all those emperor who succeed to
the empir from marcu the philosoph down to maximinu thei were
marcu and hi son commodu pertinax julian severu and hi son
antoninu caracalla macrinu heliogabalu alexand and maximinu
there is first to note that wherea in other princip the
ambit of the nobl and the insol of the peopl onli have to be
contend with the roman emperor had a third difficulti in have to
put up with the cruelti and avaric of their soldier a matter so
beset with difficulti that it wa the ruin of mani for it wa a hard
thing to give satisfact both to soldier and peopl becaus the
peopl love peac and for thi reason thei love the unaspir
princ whilst the soldier love the warlik princ who wa bold
cruel and rapaci which qualiti thei were quit will he should
exercis upon the peopl so that thei could get doubl pai and give
vent to their own greed and cruelti henc it aros that those emperor
were alwai overthrown who either by birth or train had no great
author and most of them especi those who came new to the
princip recogn the difficulti of these two oppos humour
were inclin to give satisfact to the soldier care littl about
injur the peopl which cours wa necessari becaus as princ
cannot help be hate by someon thei ought in the first place to
avoid be hate by everi on and when thei cannot compass thi thei
ought to endeavour with the utmost dilig to avoid the hatr of the
most power therefor those emperor who through inexperi had
need of special favour adher more readili to the soldier than to the
peopl a cours which turn out advantag to them or not
accordingli as the princ knew how to maintain author over them
from these caus it aros that marcu pertinax and alexand be
all men of modest life lover of justic enemi to cruelti human
and benign came to a sad end except marcu he alon live and di
honour becaus he had succeed to the throne by hereditari titl
and ow noth either to the soldier or the peopl and afterward
be possess of mani virtu which made him respect he alwai
kept both order in their place whilst he live and wa neither hate
nor despis
but pertinax wa creat emperor against the wish of the soldier
who be accustom to live licenti under commodu could not
endur the honest life to which pertinax wish to reduc them thu
have given caus for hatr to which hatr there wa ad contempt
for hi old ag he wa overthrown at the veri begin of hi
administr and here it should be note that hatr is acquir as
much by good work as by bad on therefor as i said befor a
princ wish to keep hi state is veri often forc to do evil for
when that bodi is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain
yourselfit mai be either the peopl or the soldier or the noblesy
have to submit to it humour and to gratifi them and then good work
will do you harm
but let us come to alexand who wa a man of such great good
that among the other prais which ar accord him is thi that in
the fourteen year he held the empir no on wa ever put to death by
him unjudg nevertheless be consid effemin and a man who
allow himself to be govern by hi mother he becam despis the
armi conspir against him and murder him
turn now to the opposit charact of commodu severu antoninu
caracalla and maximinu you will find them all cruel and
rapaciousmen who to satisfi their soldier did not hesit to
commit everi kind of iniqu against the peopl and all except
severu came to a bad end but in severu there wa so much valour
that keep the soldier friendli although the peopl were oppress
by him he reign successfulli for hi valour made him so much
admir in the sight of the soldier and peopl that the latter were
kept in a wai astonish and aw and the former respect and
satisfi and becaus the action of thi man as a new princ were
great i wish to show briefli that he knew well how to counterfeit the
fox and the lion which natur as i said abov it is necessari for a
princ to imit
know the sloth of the emperor julian he persuad the armi in
sclavonia of which he wa captain that it would be right to go to
rome and aveng the death of pertinax who had been kill by the
praetorian soldier and under thi pretext without appear to
aspir to the throne he move the armi on rome and reach itali
befor it wa known that he had start on hi arriv at rome the
senat through fear elect him emperor and kill julian after thi
there remain for severu who wish to make himself master of the
whole empir two difficulti on in asia where niger head of the
asiat armi had caus himself to be proclaim emperor the other in
the west where albinu wa who also aspir to the throne and as he
consid it danger to declar himself hostil to both he decid
to attack niger and to deceiv albinu to the latter he wrote that
be elect emperor by the senat he wa will to share that
digniti with him and sent him the titl of caesar and moreov that
the senat had made albinu hi colleagu which thing were accept
by albinu as true but after severu had conquer and kill niger
and settl orient affair he return to rome and complain to the
senat that albinu littl recogn the benefit that he had
receiv from him had by treacheri sought to murder him and for thi
ingratitud he wa compel to punish him afterward he sought him
out in franc and took from him hi govern and life he who will
therefor carefulli examin the action of thi man will find him a
most valiant lion and a most cun fox he will find him fear and
respect by everi on and not hate by the armi and it need not be
wonder at that he a new man wa abl to hold the empir so well
becaus hi suprem renown alwai protect him from that hatr which
the peopl might have conceiv against him for hi violenc
but hi son antoninu wa a most emin man and had veri excel
qualiti which made him admir in the sight of the peopl and
accept to the soldier for he wa a warlik man most endur of
fatigu a despis of all delic food and other luxuri which
caus him to be belov by the armi nevertheless hi feroc and
cruelti were so great and so unheard of that after endless singl
murder he kill a larg number of the peopl of rome and all those
of alexandria he becam hate by the whole world and also fear by
those he had around him to such an extent that he wa murder in the
midst of hi armi by a centurion and here it must be note that
suchlik death which ar deliber inflict with a resolv and
desper courag cannot be avoid by princ becaus ani on who
doe not fear to die can inflict them but a princ mai fear them the
less becaus thei ar veri rare he ha onli to be care not to do
ani grave injuri to those whom he emploi or ha around him in the
servic of the state antoninu had not taken thi care but had
contumeli kill a brother of that centurion whom also he daili
threaten yet retain in hi bodyguard which as it turn out wa
a rash thing to do and prove the emperor ruin
but let us come to commodu to whom it should have been veri easi to
hold the empir for be the son of marcu he had inherit it and
he had onli to follow in the footstep of hi father to pleas hi
peopl and soldier but be by natur cruel and brutal he gave
himself up to amus the soldier and corrupt them so that he
might indulg hi rapac upon the peopl on the other hand not
maintain hi digniti often descend to the theatr to compet
with gladiat and do other vile thing littl worthi of the
imperi majesti he fell into contempt with the soldier and be
hate by on parti and despis by the other he wa conspir against
and wa kill
it remain to discuss the charact of maximinu he wa a veri warlik
man and the armi be disgust with the effeminaci of alexand
of whom i have alreadi spoken kill him and elect maximinu to the
throne thi he did not possess for long for two thing made him hate
and despis the on hi have kept sheep in thrace which brought
him into contempt it be well known to all and consid a great
indign by everi on and the other hi have at the access to
hi dominion defer go to rome and take possess of the
imperi seat he had also gain a reput for the utmost feroc
by have through hi prefect in rome and elsewher in the empir
practis mani cruelti so that the whole world wa move to anger at
the mean of hi birth and to fear at hi barbar first africa
rebel then the senat with all the peopl of rome and all itali
conspir against him to which mai be ad hi own armi thi latter
besieg aquileia and meet with difficulti in take it were
disgust with hi cruelti and fear him less when thei found so
mani against him murder him
i do not wish to discuss heliogabalu macrinu or julian who be
thoroughli contempt were quickli wipe out but i will bring thi
discours to a conclus by sai that princ in our time have thi
difficulti of give inordin satisfact to their soldier in a far
less degre becaus notwithstand on ha to give them some
indulg that is soon done none of these princ have armi that
ar veteran in the govern and administr of provinc as were
the armi of the roman empir and wherea it wa then more necessari
to give satisfact to the soldier than to the peopl it is now more
necessari to all princ except the turk and the soldan to satisfi
the peopl rather the soldier becaus the peopl ar the more
power
from the abov i have except the turk who alwai keep round him
twelv thousand infantri and fifteen thousand cavalri on which depend
the secur and strength of the kingdom and it is necessari that
put asid everi consider for the peopl he should keep them
hi friend the kingdom of the soldan is similar be entir in
the hand of soldier it follow again that without regard to the
peopl he must keep them hi friend but you must note that the state
of the soldan is unlik all other princip for the reason that
it is like the christian pontif which cannot be call either an
hereditari or a newli form princip becaus the son of the old
princ ar not the heir but he who is elect to that posit by
those who have author and the son remain onli noblemen and thi
be an ancient custom it cannot be call a new princip
becaus there ar none of those difficulti in it that ar met with in
new on for although the princ is new the constitut of the state
is old and it is frame so as to receiv him as if he were it
hereditari lord
but return to the subject of our discours i sai that whoever will
consid it will acknowledg that either hatr or contempt ha been
fatal to the abovenam emperor and it will be recogn also how
it happen that a number of them act in on wai and a number in
anoth onli on in each wai came to a happi end and the rest to
unhappi on becaus it would have been useless and danger for
pertinax and alexand be new princ to imit marcu who wa
heir to the princip and likewis it would have been utterli
destruct to caracalla commodu and maximinu to have imit
severu thei not have suffici valour to enabl them to tread in
hi footstep therefor a princ new to the princip cannot
imit the action of marcu nor again is it necessari to follow
those of severu but he ought to take from severu those part which
ar necessari to found hi state and from marcu those which ar
proper and gloriou to keep a state that mai alreadi be stabl and
firm
chapter xx
ar fortress and mani other thing to which princ often resort
advantag or hurt
1 some princ so as to hold secur the state have disarm their
subject other have kept their subject town distract by faction
other have foster enmiti against themselv other have laid
themselv out to gain over those whom thei distrust in the begin
of their govern some have built fortress some have overthrown
and destroi them and although on cannot give a final judgment on
all of these thing unless on possess the particular of those
state in which a decis ha to be made nevertheless i will speak as
comprehens as the matter of itself will admit
2 there never wa a new princ who ha disarm hi subject rather
when he ha found them disarm he ha alwai arm them becaus by
arm them those arm becom your those men who were distrust
becom faith and those who were faith ar kept so and your
subject becom your adher and wherea all subject cannot be
arm yet when those whom you do arm ar benefit the other can be
handl more freeli and thi differ in their treatment which thei
quit understand make the former your depend and the latter
consid it to be necessari that those who have the most danger and
servic should have the most reward excus you but when you disarm
them you at onc offend them by show that you distrust them either
for cowardic or for want of loyalti and either of these opinion
breed hatr against you and becaus you cannot remain unarm it
follow that you turn to mercenari which ar of the charact
alreadi shown even if thei should be good thei would not be suffici
to defend you against power enemi and distrust subject
therefor as i have said a new princ in a new princip ha
alwai distribut arm histori ar full of exampl but when a
princ acquir a new state which he add as a provinc to hi old
on then it is necessari to disarm the men of that state except those
who have been hi adher in acquir it and these again with time
and opportun should be render soft and effemin and matter
should be manag in such a wai that all the arm men in the state
shall be your own soldier who in your old state were live near you
3 our forefath and those who were reckon wise were accustom
to sai that it wa necessari to hold pistoia by faction and pisa by
fortress and with thi idea thei foster quarrel in some of their
tributari town so as to keep possess of them the more easili thi
mai have been well enough in those time when itali wa in a wai
balanc but i do not believ that it can be accept as a precept for
todai becaus i do not believ that faction can ever be of us
rather it is certain that when the enemi come upon you in divid
citi you ar quickli lost becaus the weakest parti will alwai
assist the outsid forc and the other will not be abl to resist the
venetian move as i believ by the abov reason foster the
guelph and ghibellin faction in their tributari citi and although
thei never allow them to come to bloodsh yet thei nurs these
disput amongst them so that the citizen distract by their
differ should not unit against them which as we saw did not
afterward turn out as expect becaus after the rout at vaila on
parti at onc took courag and seiz the state such method argu
therefor weak in the princ becaus these faction will never be
permit in a vigor princip such method for enabl on the
more easili to manag subject ar onli us in time of peac but
if war come thi polici prove fallaci
4 without doubt princ becom great when thei overcom the
difficulti and obstacl by which thei ar confront and therefor
fortun especi when she desir to make a new princ great who
ha a greater necess to earn renown than an hereditari on caus
enemi to aris and form design against him in order that he mai
have the opportun of overcom them and by them to mount higher
as by a ladder which hi enemi have rais for thi reason mani
consid that a wise princ when he ha the opportun ought with
craft to foster some animos against himself so that have crush
it hi renown mai rise higher
5 princ especi new on have found more fidel and
assist in those men who in the begin of their rule were
distrust than among those who in the begin were trust pandolfo
petrucci princ of siena rule hi state more by those who had been
distrust than by other but on thi question on cannot speak
gener for it vari so much with the individu i will onli sai
thi that those men who at the commenc of a princedom have been
hostil if thei ar of a descript to need assist to support
themselv can alwai be gain over with the greatest eas and thei
will be tightli held to serv the princ with fidel inasmuch as
thei know it to be veri necessari for them to cancel by deed the bad
impress which he had form of them and thu the princ alwai
extract more profit from them than from those who serv him in too
much secur mai neglect hi affair and sinc the matter demand
it i must not fail to warn a princ who by mean of secret favour
ha acquir a new state that he must well consid the reason which
induc those to favour him who did so and if it be not a natur
affect toward him but onli discont with their govern then
he will onli keep them friendli with great troubl and difficulti for
it will be imposs to satisfi them and weigh well the reason
for thi in those exampl which can be taken from ancient and modern
affair we shall find that it is easier for the princ to make friend
of those men who were content under the former govern and ar
therefor hi enemi than of those who be discont with it
were favour to him and encourag him to seiz it
6 it ha been a custom with princ in order to hold their state
more secur to build fortress that mai serv as a bridl and bit
to those who might design to work against them and as a place of
refug from a first attack i prais thi system becaus it ha been
made us of formerli notwithstand that messer nicolo vitelli in
our time ha been seen to demolish two fortress in citta di castello
so that he might keep that state guido ubaldo duke of urbino on
return to hi dominion whenc he had been driven by cesar borgia
raze to the foundat all the fortress in that provinc and
consid that without them it would be more difficult to lose it the
bentivogli return to bologna came to a similar decis fortress
therefor ar us or not accord to circumst if thei do you
good in on wai thei injur you in anoth and thi question can be
reason thu the princ who ha more to fear from the peopl than
from foreign ought to build fortress but he who ha more to fear
from foreign than from the peopl ought to leav them alon the
castl of milan built by francesco sforza ha made and will make
more troubl for the hous of sforza than ani other disord in the
state for thi reason the best possibl fortress isnot to be hate by
the peopl becaus although you mai hold the fortress yet thei
will not save you if the peopl hate you for there will never be
want foreign to assist a peopl who have taken arm against you
it ha not been seen in our time that such fortress have been of us
to ani princ unless to the countess of forli1 when the count
girolamo her consort wa kill for by that mean she wa abl to
withstand the popular attack and wait for assist from milan and
thu recov her state and the postur of affair wa such at that
time that the foreign could not assist the peopl but fortress
were of littl valu to her afterward when cesar borgia attack her
and when the peopl her enemi were alli with foreign therefor
it would have been safer for her both then and befor not to have
been hate by the peopl than to have had the fortress all these
thing consid then i shall prais him who build fortress as
well as him who doe not and i shall blame whoever trust in them
care littl about be hate by the peopl

chapter xxi
how a princ should conduct himself so as to gain renown
noth make a princ so much esteem as great enterpris and
set a fine exampl we have in our time ferdinand of aragon the
present king of spain he can almost be call a new princ becaus he
ha risen by fame and glori from be an insignific king to be
the foremost king in christendom and if you will consid hi deed
you will find them all great and some of them extraordinari in the
begin of hi reign he attack granada and thi enterpris wa the
foundat of hi dominion he did thi quietli at first and without
ani fear of hindranc for he held the mind of the baron of castil
occupi in think of the war and not anticip ani innov
thu thei did not perceiv that by these mean he wa acquir power
and author over them he wa abl with the monei of the church and
of the peopl to sustain hi armi and by that long war to lai the
foundat for the militari skill which ha sinc distinguish him
further alwai us religion as a plea so as to undertak greater
scheme he devot himself with piou cruelti to drive out and
clear hi kingdom of the moor nor could there be a more admir
exampl nor on more rare under thi same cloak he assail africa
he came down on itali he ha final attack franc and thu hi
achiev and design have alwai been great and have kept the
mind of hi peopl in suspens and admir and occupi with the
issu of them and hi action have arisen in such a wai on out of
the other that men have never been given time to work steadili against
him
again it much assist a princ to set unusu exampl in intern
affair similar to those which ar relat of messer bernabo da
milano who when he had the opportun by ani on in civil life
do some extraordinari thing either good or bad would take some
method of reward or punish him which would be much spoken about
and a princ ought abov all thing alwai endeavour in everi action
to gain for himself the reput of be a great and remark man
a princ is also respect when he is either a true friend or a
downright enemi that is to sai when without ani reserv he
declar himself in favour of on parti against the other which cours
will alwai be more advantag than stand neutral becaus if two
of your power neighbour come to blow thei ar of such a charact
that if on of them conquer you have either to fear him or not in
either case it will alwai be more advantag for you to declar
yourself and to make war strenuous becaus in the first case if
you do not declar yourself you will invari fall a prei to the
conqueror to the pleasur and satisfact of him who ha been
conquer and you will have no reason to offer nor anyth to
protect or to shelter you becaus he who conquer doe not want
doubt friend who will not aid him in the time of trial and he who
lose will not harbour you becaus you did not willingli sword in
hand court hi fate
antiochu went into greec be sent for by the tolian to drive out
the roman he sent envoi to the achaean who were friend of the
roman exhort them to remain neutral and on the other hand the
roman urg them to take up arm thi question came to be discuss
in the council of the achaean where the legat of antiochu urg
them to stand neutral to thi the roman legat answer as for that
which ha been said that it is better and more advantag for your
state not to interfer in our war noth can be more erron
becaus by not interf you will be left without favour or
consider the guerdon of the conqueror thu it will alwai
happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutral
whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declar yourself with
arm and irresolut princ to avoid present danger gener
follow the neutral path and ar gener ruin but when a princ
declar himself gallantli in favour of on side if the parti with
whom he alli himself conquer although the victor mai be power
and mai have him at hi merci yet he is indebt to him and there is
establish a bond of amiti and men ar never so shameless as to
becom a monument of ingratitud by oppress you victori after all
ar never so complet that the victor must not show some regard
especi to justic but if he with whom you alli yourself lose you
mai be shelter by him and whilst he is abl he mai aid you and you
becom companion on a fortun that mai rise again
in the second case when those who fight ar of such a charact that
you have no anxieti as to who mai conquer so much the more is it
greater prudenc to be alli becaus you assist at the destruct of
on by the aid of anoth who if he had been wise would have save
him and conquer as it is imposs that he should not do with
your assist he remain at your discret and here it is to be
note that a princ ought to take care never to make an allianc with
on more power than himself for the purpos of attack other
unless necess compel him as is said abov becaus if he conquer
you ar at hi discret and princ ought to avoid as much as
possibl be at the discret of ani on the venetian join with
franc against the duke of milan and thi allianc which caus their
ruin could have been avoid but when it cannot be avoid as
happen to the florentin when the pope and spain sent armi to
attack lombardi then in such a case for the abov reason the princ
ought to favour on of the parti
never let ani govern imagin that it can choos perfectli safe
cours rather let it expect to have to take veri doubt on
becaus it is found in ordinari affair that on never seek to avoid
on troubl without run into anoth but prudenc consist in
know how to distinguish the charact of troubl and for choic to
take the lesser evil
a princ ought also to show himself a patron of abil and to honour
the profici in everi art at the same time he should encourag hi
citizen to practis their call peaceabl both in commerc and
agricultur and in everi other follow so that the on should not
be deter from improv hi possess for fear lest thei be taken
awai from him or anoth from open up trade for fear of tax but
the princ ought to offer reward to whoever wish to do these thing
and design in ani wai to honour hi citi or state
further he ought to entertain the peopl with festiv and spectacl
at conveni season of the year and as everi citi is divid into
guild or into societies1 he ought to hold such bodi in esteem
and associ with them sometim and show himself an exampl of
courtesi and liber nevertheless alwai maintain the majesti
of hi rank for thi he must never consent to abat in anyth

chapter xxii
concern the secretari of princ
the choic of servant is of no littl import to a princ and thei
ar good or not accord to the discrimin of the princ and the
first opinion which on form of a princ and of hi understand is
by observ the men he ha around him and when thei ar capabl and
faith he mai alwai be consid wise becaus he ha known how to
recogn the capabl and to keep them faith but when thei ar
otherwis on cannot form a good opinion of him for the prime error
which he made wa in choos them
there were none who knew messer antonio da venafro as the servant of
pandolfo petrucci princ of siena who would not consid pandolfo to
be a veri clever man in have venafro for hi servant becaus there
ar three class of intellect on which comprehend by itself
anoth which appreci what other comprehend and a third which
neither comprehend by itself nor by the show of other the first
is the most excel the second is good the third is useless
therefor it follow necessarili that if pandolfo wa not in the
first rank he wa in the second for whenev on ha judgment to know
good and bad when it is said and done although he himself mai not have
the initi yet he can recogn the good and the bad in hi
servant and the on he can prais and the other correct thu the
servant cannot hope to deceiv him and is kept honest
but to enabl a princ to form an opinion of hi servant there is on
test which never fail when you see the servant think more of hi
own interest than of your and seek inwardli hi own profit in
everyth such a man will never make a good servant nor will you
ever be abl to trust him becaus he who ha the state of anoth in
hi hand ought never to think of himself but alwai of hi princ
and never pai ani attent to matter in which the princ is not
concern
on the other hand to keep hi servant honest the princ ought to studi
him honour him enrich him do him kind share with
him the honour and care and at the same time let him see that he
cannot stand alon so that mani honour mai not make him desir more
mani rich make him wish for more and that mani care mai make him
dread chanc when therefor servant and princ toward servant
ar thu dispos thei can trust each other but when it is otherwis
the end will alwai be disastr for either on or the other
chapter xxiii
how flatter should be avoid
i do not wish to leav out an import branch of thi subject for it
is a danger from which princ ar with difficulti preserv unless
thei ar veri care and discrimin it is that of flatter of
whom court ar full becaus men ar so selfcomplac in their own
affair and in a wai so deceiv in them that thei ar preserv with
difficulti from thi pest and if thei wish to defend themselv thei
run the danger of fall into contempt becaus there is no other wai
of guard oneself from flatter except let men understand that
to tell you the truth doe not offend you but when everi on mai tell
you the truth respect for you abat
therefor a wise princ ought to hold a third cours by choos the
wise men in hi state and give to them onli the liberti of speak
the truth to him and then onli of those thing of which he inquir
and of none other but he ought to question them upon everyth and
listen to their opinion and afterward form hi own conclus with
these councillor separ and collect he ought to carri
himself in such a wai that each of them should know that the more
freeli he shall speak the more he shall be prefer outsid of
these he should listen to no on pursu the thing resolv on and be
steadfast in hi resolut he who doe otherwis is either
overthrown by flatter or is so often chang by vari opinion
that he fall into contempt
i wish on thi subject to adduc a modern exampl fra luca the man of
affair to maximilian1 the present emperor speak of hi majesti
said he consult with no on yet never got hi own wai in anyth
thi aros becaus of hi follow a practic the opposit to the
abov for the emperor is a secret manh doe not commun hi
design to ani on nor doe he receiv opinion on them but as in
carri them into effect thei becom reveal and known thei ar at
onc obstruct by those men whom he ha around him and he be
pliant is divert from them henc it follow that those thing he
doe on dai he undo the next and no on ever understand what he
wish or intend to do and no on can reli on hi resolut

a princ therefor ought alwai to take counsel but onli when he
wish and not when other wish he ought rather to discourag everi
on from offer advic unless he ask it but howev he ought to
be a constant inquir and afterward a patient listen concern
the thing of which he inquir also on learn that ani on on ani
consider ha not told him the truth he should let hi anger be
felt
and if there ar some who think that a princ who convei an impress
of hi wisdom is not so through hi own abil but through the good
advis that he ha around him beyond doubt thei ar deceiv
becaus thi is an axiom which never fail that a princ who is not
wise himself will never take good advic unless by chanc he ha
yield hi affair entir to on person who happen to be a veri
prudent man in thi case inde he mai be well govern but it would
not be for long becaus such a governor would in a short time take
awai hi state from him
but if a princ who is not inexperienc should take counsel from more
than on he will never get unit counsel nor will he know how to
unit them each of the counsellor will think of hi own interest
and the princ will not know how to control them or to see through
them and thei ar not to be found otherwis becaus men will alwai
prove untru to you unless thei ar kept honest by constraint
therefor it must be infer that good counsel whencesoev thei
come ar born of the wisdom of the princ and not the wisdom of the
princ from good counsel
chapter xxiv
why the princ of itali have lost their state
the previou suggest carefulli observ will enabl a new princ
to appear well establish and render him at onc more secur and
fix in the state than if he had been long seat there for the
action of a new princ ar more narrowli observ than those of an
hereditari on and when thei ar seen to be abl thei gain more men
and bind far tighter than ancient blood becaus men ar attract more
by the present than by the past and when thei find the present good
thei enjoi it and seek no further thei will also make the utmost
defenc of a princ if he fail them not in other thing thu it will
be a doubl glori for him to have establish a new princip and
adorn and strengthen it with good law good arm good alli and
with a good exampl so will it be a doubl disgrac to him who born a
princ shall lose hi state by want of wisdom
and if those seignior ar consid who have lost their state in
itali in our time such as the king of napl the duke of milan and
other there will be found in them firstli on common defect in
regard to arm from the caus which have been discuss at length in
the next place some on of them will be seen either to have had the
peopl hostil or if he ha had the peopl friendli he ha not known
how to secur the nobl in the absenc of these defect state that
have power enough to keep an armi in the field cannot be lost
philip of macedon not the father of alexand the great but he who
wa conquer by titu quintiu had not much territori compar to the
great of the roman and of greec who attack him yet be a
warlik man who knew how to attract the peopl and secur the nobl
he sustain the war against hi enemi for mani year and if in the
end he lost the dominion of some citi nevertheless he retain the
kingdom
therefor do not let our princ accus fortun for the loss of their
princip after so mani year possess but rather their own
sloth becaus in quiet time thei never thought there could be a
chang it is a common defect in man not to make ani provis in the
calm against the tempest and when afterward the bad time came thei
thought of flight and not of defend themselv and thei hope that
the peopl disgust with the insol of the conqueror would
recal them thi cours when other fail mai be good but it is veri
bad to have neglect all other expedi for that sinc you would
never wish to fall becaus you trust to be abl to find someon later
on to restor you thi again either doe not happen or if it doe
it will not be for your secur becaus that deliver is of no
avail which doe not depend upon yourself those onli ar reliabl
certain and durabl that depend on yourself and your valour
chapter xxv
what fortun can effect in human affair and how to withstand her
it is not unknown to me how mani men have had and still have the
opinion that the affair of the world ar in such wise govern by
fortun and by god that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and
that no on can even help them and becaus of thi thei would have us
believ that it is not necessari to labour much in affair but to let
chanc govern them thi opinion ha been more credit in our time
becaus of the great chang in affair which have been seen and mai
still be seen everi dai beyond all human conjectur sometim
ponder over thi i am in some degre inclin to their opinion
nevertheless not to extinguish our free will i hold it to be true
that fortun is the arbit of onehalf of our actions1 but that she
still leav us to direct the other half or perhap a littl less

the soil from place to place everyth fli befor it all yield to
it violenc without be abl in ani wai to withstand it and yet
though it natur be such it doe not follow therefor that men when
the weather becom fair shall not make provis both with defenc
and barrier in such a manner that rise again the water mai pass
awai by canal and their forc be neither so unrestrain nor so
danger so it happen with fortun who show her power where valour
ha not prepar to resist her and thither she turn her forc where
she know that barrier and defenc have not been rais to constrain
her
and if you will consid itali which is the seat of these chang and
which ha given to them their impuls you will see it to be an open
countri without barrier and without ani defenc for if it had been
defend by proper valour as ar germani spain and franc either
thi invas would not have made the great chang it ha made or it
would not have come at all and thi i consid enough to sai
concern resist to fortun in gener
but confin myself more to the particular i sai that a princ mai be
seen happi todai and ruin tomorrow without have shown ani chang
of disposit or charact thi i believ aris firstli from
caus that have alreadi been discuss at length name that the
princ who reli entir on fortun is lost when it chang i
believ also that he will be success who direct hi action
accord to the spirit of the time and that he whose action do not
accord with the time will not be success becaus men ar seen in
affair that lead to the end which everi man ha befor him name
glori and rich to get there by variou method on with caution
anoth with hast on by forc anoth by skill on by patienc
anoth by it opposit and each on succe in reach the goal by
a differ method on can also see of two cautiou men the on attain
hi end the other fail and similarli two men by differ
observ ar equal success the on be cautiou the other
impetu all thi aris from noth els than whether or not thei
conform in their method to the spirit of the time thi follow from
what i have said that two men work differ bring about the same
effect and of two work similarli on attain hi object and the
other doe not
chang in estat also issu from thi for if to on who govern
himself with caution and patienc time and affair converg in such a
wai that hi administr is success hi fortun is made but if
time and affair chang he is ruin if he doe not chang hi cours
of action but a man is not often found suffici circumspect to
know how to accommod himself to the chang both becaus he cannot
deviat from what natur inclin him to do and also becaus have
alwai prosper by act in on wai he cannot be persuad that it
is well to leav it and therefor the cautiou man when it is time
to turn adventur doe not know how to do it henc he is ruin
but had he chang hi conduct with the time fortun would not have
chang
pope juliu the second went to work impetu in all hi affair and
found the time and circumst conform so well to that line of
action that he alwai met with success consid hi first enterpris
against bologna messer giovanni bentivogli be still aliv the
venetian were not agreeabl to it nor wa the king of spain and he
had the enterpris still under discuss with the king of franc
nevertheless he person enter upon the expedit with hi
accustom bold and energi a move which made spain and the
venetian stand irresolut and passiv the latter from fear the
former from desir to recov the kingdom of napl on the other hand
he drew after him the king of franc becaus that king have
observ the movement and desir to make the pope hi friend so as
to humbl the venetian found it imposs to refus him therefor
juliu with hi impetu action accomplish what no other pontiff
with simpl human wisdom could have done for if he had wait in rome
until he could get awai with hi plan arrang and everyth fix
as ani other pontiff would have done he would never have succeed
becaus the king of franc would have made a thousand excus and the
other would have rais a thousand fear
i will leav hi other action alon as thei were all alik and thei
all succeed for the short of hi life did not let him experi
the contrari but if circumst had arisen which requir him to go
cautious hi ruin would have follow becaus he would never have
deviat from those wai to which natur inclin him
i conclud therefor that fortun be chang and mankind
steadfast in their wai so long as the two ar in agreement men ar
success but unsuccess when thei fall out for my part i consid
that it is better to be adventur than cautiou becaus fortun is a
woman and if you wish to keep her under it is necessari to beat and
illus her and it is seen that she allow herself to be master by
the adventur rather than by those who go to work more coldli she
is therefor alwai womanlik a lover of young men becaus thei
ar less cautiou more violent and with more audac command her
chapter xxvi
an exhort to liber itali from the barbarian
have carefulli consid the subject of the abov discours and
wonder within myself whether the present time were propiti to a
new princ and whether there were element that would give an
opportun to a wise and virtuou on to introduc a new order of
thing which would do honour to him and good to the peopl of thi
countri it appear to me that so mani thing concur to favour a new
princ that i never knew a time more fit than the present
and if as i said it wa necessari that the peopl of israel should be
captiv so as to make manifest the abil of mose that the persian
should be oppress by the mede so as to discov the great of the
soul of cyru and that the athenian should be dispers to illustr
the capabl of theseu then at the present time in order to
discov the virtu of an italian spirit it wa necessari that itali
should be reduc to the extrem that she is now in that she should
be more enslav than the hebrew more oppress than the persian
more scatter than the athenian without head without order beaten
despoil torn overrun and to have endur everi kind of desol
although late some spark mai have been shown by on which made us
think he wa ordain by god for our redempt nevertheless it wa
afterward seen in the height of hi career that fortun reject
him so that itali left as without life wait for him who shall yet
heal her wound and put an end to the ravag and plunder of
lombardi to the swindl and tax of the kingdom and of tuscani
and cleans those sore that for long have fester it is seen how she
entreat god to send someon who shall deliv her from these wrong
and barbar insol it is seen also that she is readi and
will to follow a banner if onli someon will rais it
nor is there to be seen at present on in whom she can place more hope
than in your illustri house1 with it valour and fortun
favour by god and by the church of which it is now the chief and
which could be made the head of thi redempt thi will not be
difficult if you will recal to yourself the action and live of the
men i have name and although thei were great and wonder men yet
thei were men and each on of them had no more opportun than the
present offer for their enterpris were neither more just nor easier
than thi nor wa god more their friend than he is your

them here there is the greatest willing and where the willing
is great the difficulti cannot be great if you will onli follow those
men to whom i have direct your attent further than thi how
extraordinarili the wai of god have been manifest beyond exampl
the sea is divid a cloud ha led the wai the rock ha pour forth

great you ought to do the rest god is not will to do
everyth and thu take awai our free will and that share of glori
which belong to us
and it is not to be wonder at if none of the abovenam italian
have been abl to accomplish all that is expect from your illustri
hous and if in so mani revolut in itali and in so mani
campaign it ha alwai appear as if militari virtu were exhaust
thi ha happen becaus the old order of thing wa not good and
none of us have known how to find a new on and noth honour a man
more than to establish new law and new ordin when he himself wa
newli risen such thing when thei ar well found and dignifi will
make him rever and admir and in itali there ar not want
opportun to bring such into us in everi form
here there is great valour in the limb whilst it fail in the head
look attent at the duel and the handtohand combat how
superior the italian ar in strength dexter and subtleti but
when it come to armi thei do not bear comparison and thi spring
entir from the insuffici of the leader sinc those who ar
capabl ar not obedi and each on seem to himself to know there
have never been ani on so distinguish abov the rest either by
valour or fortun that other would yield to him henc it is that for
so long a time and dure so much fight in the past twenti year
whenev there ha been an armi wholli italian it ha alwai given a
poor account of itself the first wit to thi is il taro
afterward allesandria capua genoa vaila bologna mestri2

if therefor your illustri hous wish to follow these remark
men who have redeem their countri it is necessari befor all thing
as a true foundat for everi enterpris to be provid with your own
forc becaus there can be no more faith truer or better
soldier and although singli thei ar good altogeth thei will be
much better when thei find themselv command by their princ
honour by him and maintain at hi expens therefor it is
necessari to be prepar with such arm so that you can be defend
against foreign by italian valour
and although swiss and spanish infantri mai be consid veri
formid nevertheless there is a defect in both by reason of which
a third order would not onli be abl to oppos them but might be
reli upon to overthrow them for the spaniard cannot resist cavalri
and the switzer ar afraid of infantri whenev thei encount them in
close combat ow to thi as ha been and mai again be seen the
spaniard ar unabl to resist french cavalri and the switzer ar
overthrown by spanish infantri and although a complet proof of thi
latter cannot be shown nevertheless there wa some evid of it at
the battl of ravenna when the spanish infantri were confront by
german battalion who follow the same tactic as the swiss when the
spaniard by agil of bodi and with the aid of their shield got in
under the pike of the german and stood out of danger abl to attack
while the german stood helpless and if the cavalri had not dash
up all would have been over with them it is possibl therefor
know the defect of both these infantri to invent a new on
which will resist cavalri and not be afraid of infantri thi need not
creat a new order of arm but a variat upon the old and these ar
the kind of improv which confer reput and power upon a new
princ
thi opportun therefor ought not to be allow to pass for
let itali at last see her liber appear nor can on express the
love with which he would be receiv in all those provinc which have
suffer so much from these foreign scour with what thirst for
reveng with what stubborn faith with what devot with what tear
what door would be close to him who would refus obedi to him
what envi would hinder him what italian would refus him homag to
all of us thi barbar dominion stink let therefor your
illustri hous take up thi charg with that courag and hope with
which all just enterpris ar undertaken so that under it standard
our nativ countri mai be ennobl and under it auspic mai be
verifi that sai of petrarch
virtu contro al furor
prendera larm e fia il combatt corto
che lantico valor
negli italici cuor non e ancor morto
virtu against furi shall advanc the fight
and it i th combat soon shall put to flight
for the old roman valour is not dead
nor in th italian brest extinguish

veri will to proce against sinigalia
it happen that not long afterward the town surrend but the
fortress would not yield to them becaus the castellan would not give
it up to ani on but the duke in person therefor thei exhort him to
come there thi appear a good opportun to the duke as be
invit by them and not go of hi own will he would awaken no
suspicion and the more to reassur them he allow all the french

the life of castruccio castracani of lucca
written by nicolo machiavelli
and sent to hi friend zanobi buondelmonti and luigi alamanni
castruccio castracani 12841328
it appear dearest zanobi and luigi a wonder thing to those who
have consid the matter that all men or the larger number of them
who have perform great deed in the world and excel all other in
their dai have had their birth and begin in base and
obscur or have been aggriev by fortun in some outrag wai
thei have either been expos to the merci of wild beast or thei have
had so mean a parentag that in shame thei have given themselv out to
be son of jove or of some other deiti it would be wearisom to relat
who these person mai have been becaus thei ar well known to
everybodi and as such tale would not be particularli edifi to
those who read them thei ar omit i believ that these lowli
begin of great men occur becaus fortun is desir of show to
the world that such men ow much to her and littl to wisdom becaus
she begin to show her hand when wisdom can realli take no part in
their career thu all success must be attribut to her castruccio
castracani of lucca wa on of those men who did great deed if he is
measur by the time in which he live and the citi in which he wa
born but like mani other he wa neither fortun nor distinguish
in hi birth as the cours of thi histori will show it appear to
be desir to recal hi memori becaus i have discern in him such
indic of valour and fortun as should make him a great exemplar
to men i think also that i ought to call your attent to hi
action becaus you of all men i know delight most in nobl deed
the famili of castracani wa formerli number among the nobl famili
of lucca but in the dai of which i speak it had somewhat fallen in
estat as so often happen in thi world to thi famili wa born a
son antonio who becam a priest of the order of san michel of lucca
and for thi reason wa honour with the titl of messer antonio he
had an onli sister who had been marri to buonaccorso cenami but
buonaccorso dy she becam a widow and not wish to marri again
went to live with her brother messer antonio had a vineyard behind the
hous where he resid and as it wa bound on all side by garden
ani person could have access to it without difficulti on morn
shortli after sunris madonna dianora as the sister of messer antonio
wa call had occas to go into the vineyard as usual to gather
herb for season the dinner and hear a slight rustl among the
leav of a vine she turn her ey in that direct and heard
someth resembl the cry of an infant whereupon she went toward
it and saw the hand and face of a babi who wa ly envelop in the
leav and who seem to be cry for it mother partli wonder and
partli fear yet full of compass she lift it up and carri it
to the hous where she wash it and cloth it with clean linen as is
customari and show it to messer antonio when he return home when
he heard what had happen and saw the child he wa not less surpris
or compassion than hi sister thei discuss between themselv
what should be done and see that he wa priest and that she had no
children thei final determin to bring it up thei had a nurs for
it and it wa rear and love as if it were their own child thei
baptiz it and gave it the name of castruccio after their father as
the year pass castruccio grew veri handsom and gave evid of
wit and discret and learnt with a quick beyond hi year those
lesson which messer antonio impart to him messer antonio intend
to make a priest of him and in time would have induct him into hi
canonri and other benefic and all hi instruct wa given with
thi object but antonio discov that the charact of castruccio
wa quit unfit for the priesthood as soon as castruccio reach
the ag of fourteen he began to take less notic of the chide of
messer antonio and madonna dianora and no longer to fear them he left
off read ecclesiast book and turn to plai with arm
delight in noth so much as in learn their us and in
run leap and wrestl with other boi in all exercis he
far excel hi companion in courag and bodili strength and if at
ani time he did turn to book onli those pleas him which told of
war and the mighti deed of men messer antonio beheld all thi with
vexat and sorrow
there live in the citi of lucca a gentleman of the guinigi famili
name messer francesco whose profess wa arm and who in rich
bodili strength and valour excel all other men in lucca he had
often fought under the command of the visconti of milan and as a
ghibellin wa the valu leader of that parti in lucca thi gentleman
resid in lucca and wa accustom to assembl with other most
morn and even under the balconi of the podesta which is at the
top of the squar of san michel the finest squar in lucca and he
had often seen castruccio take part with other children of the street
in those game of which i have spoken notic that castruccio far
excel the other boi and that he appear to exercis a royal
author over them and that thei love and obei him messer
francesco becam greatli desir of learn who he wa be
inform of the circumst of the bring up of castruccio he felt
a greater desir to have him near to him therefor he call him on
dai and ask him whether he would more willingli live in the hous of
a gentleman where he would learn to ride hors and us arm or in
the hous of a priest where he would learn noth but mass and the
servic of the church messer francesco could see that it pleas
castruccio greatli to hear hors and arm spoken of even though he
stood silent blush modestli but be encourag by messer
francesco to speak he answer that if hi master were agreeabl
noth would pleas him more than to give up hi priestli studi and
take up those of a soldier thi repli delight messer francesco and
in a veri short time he obtain the consent of messer antonio who wa
driven to yield by hi knowledg of the natur of the lad and the fear
that he would not be abl to hold him much longer
thu castruccio pass from the hous of messer antonio the priest to
the hous of messer francesco guinigi the soldier and it wa
astonish to find that in a veri short time he manifest all that
virtu and bear which we ar accustom to associ with a true
gentleman in the first place he becam an accomplish horseman and
could manag with eas the most fieri charger and in all joust and
tournament although still a youth he wa observ beyond all other
and he excel in all exercis of strength and dexter but what
enhanc so much the charm of these accomplish wa the delight
modesti which enabl him to avoid offenc in either act or word to
other for he wa deferenti to the great men modest with hi
equal and courteou to hi inferior these gift made him belov
not onli by all the guinigi famili but by all lucca when castruccio
had reach hi eighteenth year the ghibellin were driven from pavia
by the guelph and messer francesco wa sent by the visconti to assist
the ghibellin and with him went castruccio in charg of hi forc
castruccio gave ampl proof of hi prudenc and courag in thi
expedit acquir greater reput than ani other captain and
hi name and fame were known not onli in pavia but throughout all
lombardi
castruccio have return to lucca in far higher estim than he
left it did not omit to us all the mean in hi power to gain as mani
friend as he could neglect none of those art which ar necessari
for that purpos about thi time messer francesco di leav a son
thirteen year of ag name pagolo and have appoint castruccio to
be hi son tutor and administr of hi estat befor he di
francesco call castruccio to him and prai him to show pagolo that
goodwil which he francesco had alwai shown to him and to render to
the son the gratitud which he had not been abl to repai to the
father upon the death of francesco castruccio becam the governor and
tutor of pagolo which increas enorm hi power and posit and
creat a certain amount of envi against him in lucca in place of the
former univers goodwil for mani men suspect him of harbour
tyrann intent among these the lead man wa giorgio degli
opizi the head of the guelph parti thi man hope after the death of
messer francesco to becom the chief man in lucca but it seem to him
that castruccio with the great abil which he alreadi show and
hold the posit of governor depriv him of hi opportun
therefor he began to sow those seed which should rob castruccio of
hi emin castruccio at first treat thi with scorn but
afterward he grew alarm think that messer giorgio might be abl
to bring him into disgrac with the deputi of king ruberto of napl
and have him driven out of lucca
the lord of pisa at that time wa uguccion of the faggiuola of arezzo
who be in the first place elect their captain afterward becam
their lord there resid in pari some exil ghibellin from lucca
with whom castruccio held commun with the object of effect
their restor by the help of uguccion castruccio also brought
into hi plan friend from lucca who would not endur the author of
the opizi have fix upon a plan to be follow castruccio
cautious fortifi the tower of the onesti fill it with suppli
and munit of war in order that it might stand a sieg for a few
dai in case of need when the night came which had been agre upon
with uguccion who had occupi the plain between the mountain and
pisa with mani men the signal wa given and without be observ
uguccion approach the gate of san piero and set fire to the
portculli castruccio rais a great uproar within the citi call
the peopl to arm and forc open the gate from hi side uguccion
enter with hi men pour through the town and kill messer
giorgio with all hi famili and mani of hi friend and support the
governor wa driven out and the govern reform accord to the
wish of uguccion to the detriment of the citi becaus it wa found
that more than on hundr famili were exil at that time of those
who fled part went to florenc and part to pistoia which citi wa the
headquart of the guelph parti and for thi reason it becam most
hostil to uguccion and the lucches
as it now appear to the florentin and other of the guelph parti
that the ghibellin absorb too much power in tuscani thei
determin to restor the exil guelph to lucca thei assembl a
larg armi in the val di nievol and seiz montecatini from thenc
thei march to montecarlo in order to secur the free passag into
lucca upon thi uguccion assembl hi pisan and lucches forc and
with a number of german cavalri which he drew out of lombardi he move
against the quarter of the florentin who upon the appear of the
enemi withdrew from montecarlo and post themselv between
montecatini and pescia uguccion now took up a posit near to
montecarlo and within about two mile of the enemi and slight
skirmish between the hors of both parti were of daili occurr
ow to the ill of uguccion the pisan and lucches delai
come to battl with the enemi uguccion find himself grow
wors went to montecarlo to be cure and left the command of the armi
in the hand of castruccio thi chang brought about the ruin of the
guelph who think that the hostil armi have lost it captain
had lost it head grew overconfid castruccio observ thi and
allow some dai to pass in order to encourag thi belief he also
show sign of fear and did not allow ani of the munit of the
camp to be us on the other side the guelph grew more insol the
more thei saw these evid of fear and everi dai thei drew out in
the order of battl in front of the armi of castruccio present
deem that the enemi wa suffici embolden and have master
their tactic he decid to join battl with them first he spoke a
few word of encourag to hi soldier and point out to them the
certainti of victori if thei would but obei hi command castruccio
had notic how the enemi had place all hi best troop in the centr
of the line of battl and hi less reliabl men on the wing of the
armi whereupon he did exactli the opposit put hi most valiant
men on the flank while those on whom he could not so strongli reli he
move to the centr observ thi order of battl he drew out of hi
line and quickli came in sight of the hostil armi who as usual had
come in their insol to defi him he then command hi centr
squadron to march slowli whilst he move rapidli forward those on the
wing thu when thei came into contact with the enemi onli the wing
of the two armi becam engag whilst the center battalion remain
out of action for these two portion of the line of battl were
separ from each other by a long interv and thu unabl to reach
each other by thi expedi the more valiant part of castruccio men
were oppos to the weaker part of the enemi troop and the most
effici men of the enemi were disengag and thu the florentin
were unabl to fight with those who were arrai opposit to them or
to give ani assist to their own flank so without much
difficulti castruccio put the enemi to flight on both flank and the
centr battalion took to flight when thei found themselv expos to
attack without have a chanc of displai their valour the defeat
wa complet and the loss in men veri heavi there be more than ten
thousand men kill with mani offic and knight of the guelph parti
in tuscani and also mani princ who had come to help them among whom
were piero the brother of king ruberto and carlo hi nephew and
filippo the lord of taranto on the part of castruccio the loss did
not amount to more than three hundr men among whom wa francesco
the son of uguccion who be young and rash wa kill in the
first onset
thi victori so greatli increas the reput of castruccio that
uguccion conceiv some jealousi and suspicion of him becaus it
appear to uguccion that thi victori had given him no increas of
power but rather than diminish it be of thi mind he onli
wait for an opportun to give effect to it thi occur on the
death of pier agnolo mich a man of great reput and abil in
lucca the murder of whom fled to the hous of castruccio for refug
on the sergeant of the captain go to arrest the murder thei were
driven off by castruccio and the murder escap thi affair come
to the knowledg of uguccion who wa then at pisa it appear to him
a proper opportun to punish castruccio he therefor sent for hi
son neri who wa the governor of lucca and commiss him to take
castruccio prison at a banquet and put him to death castruccio
fear no evil went to the governor in a friendli wai wa
entertain at supper and then thrown into prison but neri fear
to put him to death lest the peopl should be incens kept him aliv
in order to hear further from hi father concern hi intent
ugucionn curs the hesit and cowardic of hi son and at onc
set out from pisa to lucca with four hundr horsemen to finish the
busi in hi own wai but he had not yet reach the bath when the
pisan rebel and put hi deputi to death and creat count gaddo
della gherardesca their lord befor uguccion reach lucca he heard
of the occurr at pisa but it did not appear wise to him to turn
back lest the lucches with the exampl of pisa befor them should
close their gate against him but the lucches have heard of what

there resid in the citi of lucca the poggio famili who were so

command of the armi and with a troop of cavalri set out for home
contrari to hi expect he found the rebellion at an end yet he
post hi men in the most advantag place throughout the citi as
it appear to stefano that castruccio ought to be veri much oblig to
him he sought him out and without sai anyth on hi own behalf
for he did not recogn ani need for do so he beg castruccio to
pardon the other member of hi famili by reason of their youth their
former friendship and the oblig which castruccio wa under to

stefano to reassur himself declar that it gave him more pleasur
to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caus him anxieti to

show hi clemenc and liber upon the word of stefano and
castruccio thei surrend and with stefano were immedi thrown
into prison and put to death meanwhil the florentin had recov
san miniato whereupon it seem advis to castruccio to make peac
as it did not appear to him that he wa suffici secur at lucca to
leav him he approach the florentin with the propos of a truce
which thei readili entertain for thei were weari of the war and
desir of get rid of the expens of it a treati wa conclud
with them for two year by which both parti agre to keep the
conquest thei had made castruccio thu releas from thi troubl
turn hi attent to affair in lucca and in order that he should
not again be subject to the peril from which he had just escap he
under variou pretenc and reason first wipe out all those who by
their ambit might aspir to the princip not spare on of
them but depriv them of countri and properti and those whom he had
in hi hand of life also state that he had found by experi that
none of them were to be trust then for hi further secur he
rais a fortress in lucca with the stone of the tower of those whom
he had kill or hunt out of the state
whilst castruccio made peac with the florentin and strengthen hi
posit in lucca he neglect no opportun short of open war of
increas hi import elsewher it appear to him that if he
could get possess of pistoia he would have on foot in florenc
which wa hi great desir he therefor in variou wai made friend
with the mountain and work matter so in pistoia that both
parti confid their secret to him pistoia wa divid as it
alwai had been into the bianchi and neri parti the head of the
bianchi wa bastiano di possent and of the neri jacopo da gia each

desir to drive the other out of the citi and after mani
threaten thei came to blow jacopo fortifi himself at the
florentin gate bastiano at that of the lucches side of the citi
both trust more in castruccio than in the florentin becaus thei
believ that castruccio wa far more readi and will to fight than
the florentin and thei both sent to him for assist he gave
promis to both sai to bastiano that he would come in person and
to jacopo that he would send hi pupil pagolo guinigi at the
appoint time he sent forward pagolo by wai of pisa and went himself
direct to pistoia at midnight both of them met outsid the citi and
both were admit as friend thu the two leader enter and at a

the german governor enrico wa much blame for what happenedmurd

the citi and bring back the pope have no nearer friend to whom he
could appli for help than castruccio he sent to him beg him not
onli to give him assist but also to come in person to rome
castruccio consid that he ought not to hesit to render the

dure thi time the florentin who were much enrag that castruccio
should have seiz pistoia dure the truce consid how thei could
tempt the citi to rebel to do which thei thought would not be
difficult in hi absenc among the exil pistoian in florenc were
baldo cecchi and jacopo baldini both men of lead and readi to face
danger these men kept up commun with their friend in pistoia
and with the aid of the florentin enter the citi by night and
after drive out some of castruccio offici and partisan and
kill other thei restor the citi to it freedom the new of thi
greatli anger castruccio and take leav of enrico he press on
in great hast to pistoia when the florentin heard of hi return
know that he would lose no time thei decid to intercept him with
their forc in the val di nievol under the belief that by do so
thei would cut off hi road to pistoia assembl a great armi of the
support of the guelph caus the florentin enter the pistoian
territori on the other hand castruccio reach montecarlo with hi
armi and have heard where the florentin lai he decid not to
encount it in the plain of pistoia nor to await it in the plain of
pescia but as far as he possibl could to attack it boldli in the
pass of serraval he believ that if he succeed in thi design
victori wa assur although he wa inform that the florentin had
thirti thousand men whilst he had onli twelv thousand although he
had everi confid in hi own abil and the valour of hi troop
yet he hesit to attack hi enemi in the open lest he should be
overwhelm by number serraval is a castl between pescia and
pistoia situat on a hill which block the val di nievol not in the
exact pass but about a bowshot beyond the pass itself is in place
narrow and steep whilst in gener it ascend gentli but is still
narrow especi at the summit where the water divid so that
twenti men side by side could hold it the lord of serraval wa
manfr a german who befor castruccio becam lord of pistoia had
been allow to remain in possess of the castl it be common to
the lucches and the pistoian and unclaim by eitherneith of them
wish to displac manfr as long as he kept hi promis of
neutral and came under oblig to no on for these reason
and also becaus the castl wa well fortifi he had alwai been abl
to maintain hi posit it wa here that castruccio had determin to
fall upon hi enemi for here hi few men would have the advantag and
there wa no fear lest see the larg mass of the hostil forc
befor thei becam engag thei should not stand as soon as thi
troubl with florenc aros castruccio saw the immens advantag which
possess of thi castl would give him and have an intim
friendship with a resid in the castl he manag matter so with
him that four hundr of hi men were to be admit into the castl
the night befor the attack on the florentin and the castellan put
to death
castruccio have prepar everyth had now to encourag the
florentin to persist in their desir to carri the seat of war awai
from pistoia into the val di nievol therefor he did not move hi
armi from montecarlo thu the florentin hurri on until thei
reach their encamp under serraval intend to cross the hill
on the follow morn in the meantim castruccio had seiz the
castl at night had also move hi armi from montecarlo and march
from thenc at midnight in dead silenc had reach the foot of
serraval thu he and the florentin commenc the ascent of the
hill at the same time in the morn castruccio sent forward hi
infantri by the main road and a troop of four hundr horsemen by a
path on the left toward the castl the florentin sent forward four
hundr cavalri ahead of their armi which wa follow never
expect to find castruccio in possess of the hill nor were thei
awar of hi have seiz the castl thu it happen that the
florentin horsemen mount the hill were complet taken by surpris
when thei discov the infantri of castruccio and so close were thei
upon it thei had scarc time to pull down their visor it wa a case
of unreadi soldier be attack by readi and thei were assail
with such vigour that with difficulti thei could hold their own
although some few of them got through when the nois of the fight
reach the florentin camp below it wa fill with confus the
cavalri and infantri becam inextric mix the captain were
unabl to get their men either backward or forward ow to the
narrow of the pass and amid all thi tumult no on knew what ought
to be done or what could be done in a short time the cavalri who were
engag with the enemi infantri were scatter or kill without
have made ani effect defenc becaus of their unfortun
posit although in sheer desper thei had offer a stout
resist retreat had been imposs with the mountain on both
flank whilst in front were their enemi and in the rear their
friend when castruccio saw that hi men were unabl to strike a
decis blow at the enemi and put them to flight he sent on thousand
infantrymen round by the castl with order to join the four hundr
horsemen he had previous dispatch there and command the whole
forc to fall upon the flank of the enemi these order thei carri
out with such furi that the florentin could not sustain the attack
but gave wai and were soon in full retreatconqu more by their
unfortun posit than by the valour of their enemi those in the
rear turn toward pistoia and spread through the plain each man
seek onli hi own safeti the defeat wa complet and veri
sanguinari mani captain were taken prison among whom were bandini
dei rossi francesco brunelleschi and giovanni della tosa all
florentin noblemen with mani tuscan and neapolitan who fought on
the florentin side have been sent by king ruberto to assist the
guelph immedi the pistoian heard of thi defeat thei drove out
the friend of the guelph and surrend to castruccio he wa not
content with occupi prato and all the castl on the plain on both
side of the arno but march hi armi into the plain of peretola
about two mile from florenc here he remain mani dai divid the
spoil and celebr hi victori with feast and game hold
hors race and foot race for men and women he also struck medal in
commemor of the defeat of the florentin he endeavour to
corrupt some of the citizen of florenc who were to open the citi
gate at night but the conspiraci wa discov and the
particip in it taken and behead among whom were tommaso lupacci
and lambertuccio frescobaldi thi defeat caus the florentin great
anxieti and despair of preserv their liberti thei sent envoi
to king ruberto of napl offer him the dominion of their citi and
he know of what immens import the mainten of the guelph
caus wa to him accept it he agre with the florentin to
receiv from them a yearli tribut of two hundr thousand florin and
he sent hi son carlo to florenc with four thousand horsemen
shortli after thi the florentin were reliev in some degre of the
pressur of castruccio armi ow to hi be compel to leav
hi posit befor florenc and march on pisa in order to suppress a
conspiraci that had been rais against him by benedetto lanfranchi
on of the first men in pisa who could not endur that hi fatherland
should be under the dominion of the lucches he had form thi
conspiraci intend to seiz the citadel kill the partisan of
castruccio and drive out the garrison as howev in a conspiraci
pauciti of number is essenti to secreci so for it execut a few
ar not suffici and in seek more adher to hi conspiraci
lanfranchi encount a person who reveal the design to castruccio
thi betray cannot be pass by without sever reproach to bonifacio
cerchi and giovanni guidi two florentin exil who were suffer
their banish in pisa thereupon castruccio seiz benedetto and put
him to death and behead mani other nobl citizen and drove their
famili into exil it now appear to castruccio that both pisa and
pistoia were thoroughli disaffect he emploi much thought and
energi upon secur hi posit there and thi gave the florentin
their opportun to reorgan their armi and to await the come of
carlo the son of the king of napl when carlo arriv thei decid
to lose no more time and assembl a great armi of more than thirti
thousand infantri and ten thousand cavalryhav call to their aid
everi guelph there wa in itali thei consult whether thei should
attack pistoia or pisa first and decid that it would be better to
march on the lattera cours ow to the recent conspiraci more
like to succe and of more advantag to them becaus thei believ
that the surrend of pistoia would follow the acquisit of pisa
in the earli part of mai 1328 the florentin put in motion thi armi
and quickli occupi lastra signa montelupo and empoli pass from
thenc on to san miniato when castruccio heard of the enorm armi
which the florentin were send against him he wa in no degre
alarm believ that the time had now arriv when fortun would
deliv the empir of tuscani into hi hand for he had no reason to
think that hi enemi would make a better fight or had better prospect
of success than at pisa or serraval he assembl twenti thousand
foot soldier and four thousand horsemen and with thi armi went to
fucecchio whilst he sent pagolo guinigi to pisa with five thousand
infantri fucecchio ha a stronger posit than ani other town in the
pisan district ow to it situat between the river arno and
gusciana and it slight elev abov the surround plain
moreov the enemi could not hinder it be victual unless thei
divid their forc nor could thei approach it either from the
direct of lucca or pisa nor could thei get through to pisa or
attack castruccio forc except at a disadvantag in on case thei
would find themselv place between hi two armi the on under hi
own command and the other under pagolo and in the other case thei
would have to cross the arno to get to close quarter with the enemi
an undertak of great hazard in order to tempt the florentin to
take thi latter cours castruccio withdrew hi men from the bank of
the river and place them under the wall of fucecchio leav a wide
expans of land between them and the river
the florentin have occupi san miniato held a council of war to
decid whether thei should attack pisa or the armi of castruccio and
have weigh the difficulti of both cours thei decid upon the
latter the river arno wa at that time low enough to be fordabl yet
the water reach to the shoulder of the infantrymen and to the
saddl of the horsemen on the morn of 10 june 1328 the
florentin commenc the battl by order forward a number of
cavalri and ten thousand infantri castruccio whose plan of action wa
fix and who well knew what to do at onc attack the florentin
with five thousand infantri and three thousand horsemen not allow
them to issu from the river befor he charg them he also sent on
thousand light infantri up the river bank and the same number down the
arno the infantri of the florentin were so much imped by their
arm and the water that thei were not abl to mount the bank of the
river whilst the cavalri had made the passag of the river more
difficult for the other by reason of the few who had cross have
broken up the bed of the river and thi be deep with mud mani of
the hors roll over with their rider and mani of them had stuck so
fast that thei could not move when the florentin captain saw the
difficulti their men were meet thei withdrew them and move
higher up the river hope to find the river bed less treacher and
the bank more adapt for land these men were met at the bank by
the forc which castruccio had alreadi sent forward who be light
arm with buckler and javelin in their hand let fly with
tremend shout into the face and bodi of the cavalri the hors
alarm by the nois and the wound would not move forward and
trampl each other in great confus the fight between the men of
castruccio and those of the enemi who succeed in cross wa sharp
and terribl both side fought with the utmost desper and neither
would yield the soldier of castruccio fought to drive the other back
into the river whilst the florentin strove to get a foot on land
in order to make room for the other press forward who if thei
could but get out of the water would be abl to fight and in thi
obstin conflict thei were urg on by their captain castruccio
shout to hi men that these were the same enemi whom thei had
befor conquer at serraval whilst the florentin reproach each
other that the mani should be overcom by the few at length
castruccio see how long the battl had last and that both hi
men and the enemi were utterli exhaust and that both side had mani
kill and wound push forward anoth bodi of infantri to take up
a posit at the rear of those who were fight he then command
these latter to open their rank as if thei intend to retreat and
on part of them to turn to the right and anoth to the left thi
clear a space of which the florentin at onc took advantag and
thu gain possess of a portion of the battlefield but when these
tire soldier found themselv at close quarter with castruccio
reserv thei could not stand against them and at onc fell back into
the river the cavalri of either side had not as yet gain ani
decis advantag over the other becaus castruccio know hi
inferior in thi arm had command hi leader onli to stand on the
defens against the attack of their adversari as he hope that
when he had overcom the infantri he would be abl to make short work
of the cavalri thi fell out as he had hope for when he saw the
florentin armi driven back across the river he order the remaind
of hi infantri to attack the cavalri of the enemi thi thei did with
lanc and javelin and join by their own cavalri fell upon the
enemi with the greatest furi and soon put him to flight the florentin
captain have seen the difficulti their cavalri had met with in
cross the river had attempt to make their infantri cross lower
down the river in order to attack the flank of castruccio armi but
here also the bank were steep and alreadi line by the men of
castruccio and thi movement wa quit useless thu the florentin
were so complet defeat at all point that scarc a third of them
escap and castruccio wa again cover with glori mani captain
were taken prison and carlo the son of king ruberto with
michelagnolo falconi and taddeo degli albizzi the florentin
commission fled to empoli if the spoil were great the slaughter
wa infinit greater as might be expect in such a battl of the
florentin there fell twenti thousand two hundr and thirtyon men
whilst castruccio lost on thousand five hundr and seventi men
but fortun grow enviou of the glori of castruccio took awai hi
life just at the time when she should have preserv it and thu
ruin all those plan which for so long a time he had work to carri
into effect and in the success prosecut of which noth but
death could have stop him castruccio wa in the thick of the battl
the whole of the dai and when the end of it came although fatigu
and overh he stood at the gate of fucecchio to welcom hi men on
their return from victori and person thank them he wa also on the
watch for ani attempt of the enemi to retriev the fortun of the dai
he be of the opinion that it wa the duti of a good gener to be
the first man in the saddl and the last out of it here castruccio
stood expos to a wind which often rise at middai on the bank of the
arno and which is often veri unhealthi from thi he took a chill of
which he thought noth as he wa accustom to such troubl but it
wa the caus of hi death on the follow night he wa attack with
high fever which increas so rapidli that the doctor saw it must
prove fatal castruccio therefor call pagolo guinigi to him and
address him as follow
if i could have believ that fortun would have cut me off in the
midst of the career which wa lead to that glori which all my
success promis i should have labour less and i should have left
thee if a smaller state at least with fewer enemi and peril
becaus i should have been content with the governorship of lucca and
pisa i should neither have subjug the pistoian nor outrag the
florentin with so mani injuri but i would have made both these
peopl my friend and i should have live if no longer at least
more peacefulli and have left you a state without a doubt smaller but
on more secur and establish on a surer foundat but fortun who
insist upon have the arbitra of human affair did not endow me
with suffici judgment to recogn thi from the first nor the time
to surmount it thou hast heard for mani have told thee and i have
never conceal it how i enter the hous of thy father whilst yet a
boya stranger to all those ambit which everi gener soul should
feeland how i wa brought up by him and love as though i had been
born of hi blood how under hi govern i learn to be valiant and
capabl of avail myself of all that fortun of which thou hast been
wit when thy good father came to die he commit thee and all
hi possess to my care and i have brought thee up with that love
and increas thy estat with that care which i wa bound to show and
in order that thou shouldst not onli possess the estat which thy
father left but also that which my fortun and abil have gain
i have never marri so that the love of children should never deflect
my mind from that gratitud which i ow to the children of thy father
thu i leav thee a vast estat of which i am well content but i am
deepli concern inasmuch as i leav it thee unsettl and insecur
thou hast the citi of lucca on thy hand which will never rest
content under thy govern thou hast also pisa where the men ar
of natur changeabl and unreli who although thei mai be
sometim held in subject yet thei will ever disdain to serv under
a lucches pistoia is also disloy to thee she be eaten up with
faction and deepli incens against thy famili by reason of the wrong
recent inflict upon them thou hast for neighbour the offend
florentin injur by us in a thousand wai but not utterli
destroi who will hail the new of my death with more delight than
thei would the acquisit of all tuscani in the emperor and in the
princ of milan thou canst place no relianc for thei ar far
distant slow and their help is veri long in come therefor thou
hast no hope in anyth but in thine own abil and in the memori
of my valour and in the prestig which thi latest victori ha brought
thee which as thou knowest how to us it with prudenc will assist
thee to come to term with the florentin who as thei ar suffer
under thi great defeat should be inclin to listen to thee and
wherea i have sought to make them my enemi becaus i believ that
war with them would conduc to my power and glori thou hast everi
induc to make friend of them becaus their allianc will bring
thee advantag and secur it is of the greatest import in thi
world that a man should know himself and the measur of hi own
strength and mean and he who know that he ha not a geniu for
fight must learn how to govern by the art of peac and it will be
well for thee to rule thy conduct by my counsel and to learn in thi
wai to enjoi what my lifework and danger have gain and in thi
thou wilt easili succe when thou hast learnt to believ that what i
have told thee is true and thou wilt be doubli indebt to me in that
i have left thee thi realm and have taught thee how to keep it
after thi there came to castruccio those citizen of pisa pistoia
and lucca who had been fight at hi side and whilst recommend
pagolo to them and make them swear obedi to him as hi
successor he di he left a happi memori to those who had known him
and no princ of those time wa ever love with such devot as he
wa hi obsequi were celebr with everi sign of mourn and he
wa buri in san francesco at lucca fortun wa not so friendli to
pagolo guinigi as she had been to castruccio for he had not the
abil not long after the death of castruccio pagolo lost pisa
and then pistoia and onli with difficulti held on to lucca thi
latter citi continu in the famili of guinigi until the time of the
greatgrandson of pagolo
from what ha been relat here it will be seen that castruccio wa a
man of except abil not onli measur by men of hi own time
but also by those of an earlier date in statur he wa abov the
ordinari height and perfectli proport he wa of a graciou
presenc and he welcom men with such urban that those who spoke
with him rare left him displeas hi hair wa inclin to be red
and he wore it cut short abov the ear and whether it rain or
snow he alwai went without a hat he wa delight among friend
but terribl to hi enemi just to hi subject readi to plai fals
with the unfaith and will to overcom by fraud those whom he
desir to subdu becaus he wa wont to sai that it wa the victori
that brought the glori not the method of achiev it no on wa
bolder in face danger none more prudent in extric himself he

will die as he did be on night in the hous of on of hi
gentlemen where mani ladi were assembl he wa reprov by on of
hi friend for danc and amus himself with them more than wa
usual in on of hi station so he said he who is consid wise by

themselv he had onli kill a new enemi castruccio prais greatli
those men who intend to take a wife and then did not do so sai
that thei were like men who said thei would go to sea and then refus
when the time came he said that it alwai struck him with surpris
that whilst men in bui an earthen or glass vase would sound it first
to learn if it were good yet in choos a wife thei were content with
onli look at her he wa onc ask in what manner he would wish to

strang to him that fra lazeron should go to paradis and uguccion
della faggiuola to the inferno he wa onc ask when should a man eat
to preserv hi health and repli if the man be rich let him eat
when he is hungri if he be poor then when he can see on of hi
gentlemen make a member of hi famili lace him up he said to him i
prai god that you will let him feed you also see that someon had
written upon hi hous in latin the word mai god preserv thi hous
from the wick he said the owner must never go in pass
through on of the street he saw a small hous with a veri larg door
and remark that hous will fly through the door he wa have a
discuss with the ambassador of the king of napl concern the

and the ambassador ask him if he had no fear of the king is thi
king of your a bad man or a good on ask castruccio and wa told
that he wa a good on whereupon he said why should you suggest that
i should be afraid of a good man
i could recount mani other stori of hi sai both witti and
weighti but i think that the abov will be suffici testimoni to hi
high qualiti he live fortyfour year and wa in everi wai a
princ and as he wa surround by mani evid of hi good fortun
so he also desir to have near him some memori of hi bad fortun
therefor the manacl with which he wa chain in prison ar to be
seen to thi dai fix up in the tower of hi resid where thei
were place by him to testifi forev to hi dai of advers as in
hi life he wa inferior neither to philip of macedon the father of
alexand nor to scipio of rome so he di in the same year of hi
ag as thei did and he would doubtless have excel both of them had
fortun decre that he should be born not in lucca but in macedonia
