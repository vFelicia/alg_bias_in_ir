introductori note
pedro calderon de la barca wa born in madrid januari 17 1600 of
good famili he wa educ at the jesuit colleg in madrid and at the
univers of salamanca and a doubt tradit sai that he began

reward hi servic with pension and had hi plai produc with
great splendor he di mai 5 1681
at the time when calderon began to compos for the stage the spanish
drama wa at it height lope de vega the most prolif and with
calderon the greatest of spanish dramatist wa still aliv and by
hi applaus gave encourag to the beginn whose fame wa to rival
hi own the nation type of drama which lope had establish wa
maintain in it essenti characterist by calderon and he produc
abund specimen of all it varieti of regular plai he ha left
a hundr and twenti of auto sacramental the peculiar spanish
allegor develop of the mediev mysteri we have seventythre
besid a consider number of farc
the domin motiv in calderon drama ar characterist
nation fervid loyalti to church and king and a sens of honor
heighten almost to the point of the fantast though hi plai
ar laid in a great varieti of scene and ag the sentiment and the
charact remain essenti spanish and thi intens local qualiti
ha probabl lessen the vogu of calderon in other countri in the
construct and conduct of hi plot he show great skill yet the
ingenu expend in the manag of the stori did not restrain the
fieri emot and opul imagin which mark hi finest speech
and give them a lyric qualiti which some critic regard as hi greatest
distinct
of all calderon work life is a dream mai be regard as the most
univers in it theme it seek to teach a lesson that mai be learn
from the philosoph and religi thinker of mani agesthat the
world of our sens is a mere shadow and that the onli realiti is to be
found in the invis and etern the stori which form it basi
is orient in origin and in the form of the legend of barlaam and
josaphat wa familiar in all the literatur of the middl ag
combin with thi in the plot is the tale of abou hassan from the
arabian night the main situat in which ar turn to farcic
purpos in the induct to the shakespearean tame of the shrew
but with calderon the theme is lift altogeth out of the atmospher
of comedi and is work up with poetic sentiment and a touch of
mystic into a symbol drama of profound and univers philosoph
signific

and thu propos the do it clotaldo
who guard my son with old fidel
shall bring him hither from hi tower by night
lockt in a sleep so fast as by my art
i rivet to within a link of death
but yet from death so far that next dai dawn
shall wake him up upon the royal bed
complet in conscious and faculti
when with all princ pomp and retinu
my loyal peer with due obeis
shall hail him segismund the princ of poland
then if with ani show of human kind
he fling discredit not upon the star
but upon me their misinterpret
with all apolog mistaken ag
can make to youth it never meant to harm
to my son forehead will i shift the crown
i long have wishd upon a younger brow
and in religi humili
for what of wornout ag remain to me
entreat my pardon both of heaven and him
for tempt destini beyond my reach
but if as i misdoubt at hi first step
the hoof of the predict savag show
befor predict mischief can be done
the selfsam sleep that loos him from the chain
shall reconsign him not to loos again
then shall i have lost that heir direct
look sole to my sister children twain
each of a claim so equal as divid
the voic of poland to their sever side
but as i trust to be entwin er long
into on singl wreath so fair and strong
as shall at onc all differ aton
and ceas the realm divis with their own
cousin and princ peer and councillor
such is the purport of thi invit
and such is my design whose further
if not as sovereign if not as seer
yet on whom these white lock if noth els
to patient acquiesc consecr
i now demand and even supplic
ast
such new and from such lip mai well suspend
the tongu to loyal answer most attun
but if to me as spokesman of my faction
your high look for answer i repli
for on and alllet segismund whom now
we first hear tell of as your live heir
appear and but in your suffici ey
approv himself worthi to be your son
then we will hail him poland right heir
what sai my cousin

ay with all my heart
but if my youth and sex upbraid me not
that i should dare ask of so wise a king
king

not well considerd nai if twere yet noth
but pardon from such lip as those
est
then with your pardon sirif segismund
my cousin whom i shall rejoic to hail
as princ of poland too as you propos
be to a trial come upon which
more as i think than life itself depend
why sir with sleepdisorderd sens brought
to thi uncertain contest with hi star
king
well askd inde as wise be it answerd
becaus it is uncertain see you not
for as i think i can discern between
the sudden flaw of a sleepstartl man
and of the savag thing we have to dread
if but bewilderd dazzl and uncouth
as might the sanest and the civilest
in circumst so strangenai more than that
if move to ani outbreak short of blood
all shall be well with him and how much more
if mid the magic turmoil of the chang
he shall so calm a resolut show
as scarc to reel beneath so great a blow
but if with savag passion uncontrolld
he lai about him like the brute foretold
and must as suddenli be cage again
then what redoubl anguish and despair
from that brief flash of bliss liberti
remittedand for everto hi chain
which so much less if on the stage of glori
enterd and exit through such a door
of sleep as make a dream of all between
est
oh kindli answer sir to question that
to charit courtesi less wise
might call for pardon rather i shall now
gladli what uninstruct loyal
i should have wait

true but as thei sai
dream ar rough copi of the wake soul

half night half dai half sleep half awak
how if our wake life like that of sleep

to which we wake not till we sleep in death
how if i sai the sens we now trust

how i should bear myself beneath it not

and conscienc on dai to account for it
a dream it wa in which i thought myself
and you that haild me now then haild me king
in a brave palac that wa all my own
within and all without it mine until
drunk with excess of majesti and pride
methought i towerd so high and swelld so wide
that of myself i burst the glitter bubbl
that my ambit had about me blown
and all again wa dark such a dream
