these sketch ar i fear veri unscientif and unsystemat thei
record the growth of my own interest and inform as i have recent
observ and enjoi the tree among which i had walk unse far too
mani year to pass on as well as i can some of the benefit that ha
come into my own life from thi waken interest in the tree provid
by the creator for the rest of tire brain and the heal of
ruffl spirit as well as for util is the reason for gather
togeth and somewhat extend the paper that have brought me as thei
have appear in the page of the outlook so mani letter of
fellowship and appreci from other who have often seen more clearli
and deepli into the wood than i mai hope to
driven out from my desk by weari sometimesand as often i confess
by a rasp temper i would fain hide from displayi have never fail
to find rest and peac and much to see and to love among the common
and familiar tree to which i hope these mere hint of some of their
featur not alwai seen mai send other who also need their silent and

a stori of some mapl
thi is not a botan disquisit it is not a complet account of
all the member of the import tree famili of mapl i am not a
botanist nor a true scientif observ but onli a plain treelov
and i have been watch some tree bloom and bud and grow and fruit for
a few year us a camera now and then to record what i seeand much
more than i see usual
in the sweet springtim when the rise of the sap incit some to
poetri some to make mapl sugar and some to watch for the first
flower it is well to look at a few treebloom and to consid the
possibl and the pleasur of a peac hunt that can be made with
profit in citi street or park as well as along countri roadsid and in
the meadow and the wood
who doe not know of the mapl that ar all around us yet who ha
seen the commonest of them bloom in veri earli spring or watch the
cours of the peculiar wing seedpod or kei that follow the
flower the white or silver mapl of street or roadsid the soft
mapl of the wood is on of the most familiar of american tree it
rapid and vigor growth endear it to the man who is in a hurri for
shade and it sturdi limb ar the joi of the treebutch who trim
them short in later year
illustr silver mapl flower
watch thi mapl in veri earli springeven befor spring is ani more
than a calendar probabilityand a singular bloom will be found along
the slender twig like littl loosehair brush these flower ar
come often brave in sleet and snow and seemingli abl to set and
fertil regardless of the weather thei hurri through the bloomtim
as thei must do to carri out the liferound for the grace
twowing seed that follow them ar pick up and whirl about by
april wind and if thei lodg in the warm earth ar fulli abl to
grow into fine littl tree the same season examin these seedpod
kei or samara thi last is a scientif name with such euphoni to it
that it might well becom common and notic the delic vein in
the transluc wing see the grace line of the whole thing and
realiz what an abund provis dame natur make for
reproductionfor a moderates tree complet mani thousand of
these fine form greenish yellow wing samara and cast them
loos for the wind to distribut dure enough dai to secur the best
chanc of the season
thi same silver mapl is a bone of content among treemen at time
some will tell you it is coars and so it is when plant in an
improp place upon a narrow street allow to flourish unrestrain
for year and then ruthlessli crop off to a headless trunk but set
it on a broad lawn or upon a roadsid with gener room and it nobl
statur and grace need yield noth to the most artist elm of new
england and in the deep wood it sometim reach a majesti and a
digniti that compel admir the great mapl at eagl mere is the
king of the bit of primev forest yet remain to that mountain rest
spot it tower high over matur hemlock and beech and seem well
abl to defi futur centuri
but there is anoth veri earli mapl to watch for and it is on wide
distribut in the eastern state the red or scarlet mapl is well
name for it flower not ani more conspicu in form than those of
it close relat the silver mapl ar usual bright red or yellow
and thei give a joyou color note in the veri begin of spring
overtur not long ar these flower with us thei fade onli to be
quickli succeed by even more brilliant samara a littl more delic
and refin than those of the silver mapl as well as of the richest
and warmest hue particularli in new england doe thi mapl provid a
notabl spring color show
illustr young leav of the red mapl
the leav of the red mapleit is also the swamp mapl of some
localitiesa thei open to the coax of april sun and april
shower have a special charm thei ar properli red but mingl with
the characterist color is a whole palett of tint of soft yellow
bronz and apricot as the littl babi leaflet open thei ar shini and
crinkli and altogeth attract on think of the more aristocrat
and dwarf japanes mapl in look at the open of these
redbrown beauti and it is no pleasur to see them smooth out into
sedat green again in fall a glori of color come to the leav
of the red mapl for thei illumin the countrysid with their scarlet
hue and as thei drop form a brilliant thread in the most beauti of
all carpetsthat of the autumn leav i think no walk in the realli
happi dai of the fall matur of grow thing is quit so pleasant
as that which lead on to shuffl through thi deep forest floor
cover of orient rich of hue
as the ground warm and the sun search into the heart of the bud
the norwai mapl familiar street tree of eastern citi break into a
wonder bloom veri decept it is and taken for the open foliag
by the casual observ yet there is when these flower first open no
hint of leaf on the tree save that of the swell bud all that soft
haze of greenish yellow is bloom and bloom of the utmost beauti the
charm li not in bold of color or of contrast but at the other
extremein the delicaci of differ tint in the varieti of subtl
shade and tone there ar charm of form and of fragranc too in
thi norwai mapleth flower ar manyrai star and thei emit a
faint spici odor notic onli when sever tree ar togeth in
bloom and these flower last long compar so long that the
greenish yellow of the young leav begin to combin with them befor
thei fall the tint of flower and of leaf melt insens into each
other so that as i have remark befor the casual observ sai
the leav ar out on the norwai maplesnot know of the great
mass of delight flower that have preced the leav abov hi
unse ey i emphas thi for i hope some of my reader mai be on
the outlook for a new pleasur in earli springth bloom of thi
mapl with flower so thoroughli distinct and so entir beauti
illustr the norwai mapl break into a wonder bloom
the samara to follow on thi norwai mapl ar smaller than those of the
other two mapl mention and thei hang togeth at a differ angl
somewhat more grace i have often wonder how the design who
work to death the pansi the rose and the violet have manag to
miss a form or motiv of such valu suggest at onc the nearbi
street and farawai egypt
illustr samara of the sugar mapl
a pure american speci and on of as much econom import as ani
leafdrop tree is the sugar mapl known also as rock mapleon
design becaus we can get sweet from it sap the other
becaus of the hard of it wood the sugar mapl of new england to
me ar more individu and almost more essenti beauti than the
fame elm no saccharin lifeblood is drawn from the elm therefor
it eleg is consid i notic that we seldom think much of beauti
when it attach to someth we can eat who realiz that the common
corn the american maiz is a state and eleg plant far more
beauti than mani a pamper pet of the greenhous but thi is not a
corn storyi shall hope to be heard on the neglect beauti of mani
common thing some dayand we can for the time overlook the syrup of
the sugar mapl for it delic blossom come long after the red and
the silver ar done with their flower these sugarmapl bloom hang on
slender stem thei come with the first leav and ar veri differ
in appear from the flower of other mapl the observ will have
no troubl in recogn them after the first success attempt even
though he mai be baffl in compar the mapl leav by the appar
similar of the foliag of the norwai the sugar and the sycamor
mapl at certain stage of growth
illustr a matur sycamor mapl
after all it is the autumn time that bring thi mapl most strongli
befor us for it flaunt it banner of scarlet and yellow in the
wood along the road with an insouci swing of it own the sugar
possibl is forgotten and it is a pure autumn pleasur to appreci
the rich of color to be soon follow by the more sober cogniz
of the eleg of outlin and form disclos when all the delic
traceri of twig and bough stand reveal against winter frosti sky
the sugar mapl ha a curiou habit of ripen or redden some of it
branch veri earli as if it wa hang out a warn signal to the
squirrel and the chipmunk to hurri along with their store of nut
against the winter need i rememb be puzzl on august morn
as i drove along on of delawar flat flat road to know what could
possibl have produc the brilliant blaze scarlet banner that hung
across a distant wood as if a dozen red flag were be there
displai closer approach disclos on rakish branch on a sugar mapl
all afir with color while everi other leaf on the tree yet held the
green of summer
again in the mountain on late summer half a lusti sugar mapl set up
a conflagr which i wa inform presag it earli death but the
next summer it grew as freeli as ever and retain it sober green
until the cool dai and night just as if the ebullit of the season
previou wa but a break out of extra color life rather than a
suggest of weak or death
illustr sycamor mapl blossom
the norwai mapl is botan acer platanoid realli mean
planelik mapl from the similar of it leav to those of the
european plane the sycamor mapl is acer pseudoplatanu which
be translat mean that old linnu thought it a sort of fals
planelik mapl both ar european speci but both ar far more
familiar as street and lawn tree to us dweller in citi than ar
mani of our pure american speci there is a littl differ in the
bark of the two and the leav of the sycamor while almost ident
in form ar darker and thicker than those of the norwai and thei ar
whitish underneath instead of light green the habit of the two is
twinlik thei can scarc be distinguish when the leav ar off
but the flower ar total differ and on would hardli believ them
to be akin judg onli by appear the young leav of the
sycamor mapl ar lush and vigor when the long grapelik
flowerclust appear below the twig racem thei ar
botanicallyand that is anoth truli good scientif wordwhil the
beauti norwai mapl flower must stand the angular design of
corymb but dont miss look for the sycamor mapl long
pendul racem thei seem more grapelik than grape blossom and
thei stai long appar the transit from flower to fruit be
veri gradual i mind me of a sycamor i pass everi winter dai with it
dead fruitclust a reminisc of the flowerracem swing in
the frosti breez wait until the spring push of the life within the
twig shove them off
to be readi to recogn thi mapl at the right time it is well to
observ and mark the differ between it and the norwai in the summer
time note the leav and the bark as suggest abov
illustr flower of the ashleav mapl
anoth mapl that is differ is on various known as boxeld
ashleav mapl or negundo of rapid growth it make a lusti
irregular tree it greenbark withelik limb seem will to grow
in ani directiondown up sidewiseand the result is a peculiar
formless that ha it own merit i think of a fring of boxeld
along paxton creek deck in earli spring with true mapl flower on
threadlik stem each cluster surmount by soft green foliag
appar borrow from the ash and it seem that no other tree could
fit better into the place or the season then i rememb anoth a
singl state tree that ha had a great field all to itself and stand
up in superb digniti domin even the group of pinoak nearest to
it twa the surpris mist of bloom on thi tree that took me up the
field on a run on spring dai when the run wa sweet in the air
but sticki underfoot the color effect of the flower is most delic
and almost indescrib in ordinari chromat term dont miss the
acquaint of the ashleav mapl at it flower time in the veri
flush of the springtim my treelov friend
i have not found a notic fragranc in the flower of the boxeld
such as is veri appar where there is a group of norwai mapl in
bloom togeth the red mapl also give to the air a faint and
delightfulli spici odor under favor condit mai i hint that the
lusti boxeld when it is boom along it spring growth furnish
a loosebark whistl stick about as good as those that come from the
willow the gener growth that provid it loosen sap can also
spare a few twig for the boi and thei will be all the better for a
melodi reason for the spring rambl

curiou small tree or larg shrub is not well known though grow
freeli as elkwood and moosewood in the alleghani becaus it is
rather hard to transplant and thu offer no induc to the
nurserymen these good peopl like the rest of us move along the line
of least resist wherefor mani a fine tree or fruit is rare to us
becaus shy or difficult of growth or perhap unsymmetr the fine
rhode island green appl is unpopular becaus the young tree is
crook while the leatherskin and punkflesh ben davi is a model
of symmetri and rapid of growth our gloriou tulip tree of the

of the japanes maplestheir leav seemingli a show of the
ingenu of these yanke of the orient in their twist of form and
depth of odd colori could tell a tale but it would be of the tree
nurseri and not of the broad outdoor let us close the book and go
afield in park or meadow on street or lawn and look to the mapl for
an unsuspect feast of bloom if it be spring or for rich of
foliag in summer and autumn and in coldest winter let us notic the
delic twig and yet sturdi structur of thi tree famili that is most
of all characterist of the home in citi or countri
the growth of the oak
the old saw ha it great oak from littl acorn grow and all of us
who rememb the sai have thu some idea of what the begin of an
oak is but what of the begin of the acorn in a gener wai on
inferenti suppos that there must be a flower somewher in the
lifehistori of the tower white oak that ha defi the storm of
centuri and seem a type of everyth sturdi and strong and
masculin but what sort of a flower could on imagin as the sourc of
so much majesti we know of the great magnolia with bloom befit
the rich of the foliag that follow them we see and some of us
admir the exquisit delic blossom of that splendid american
tree the tulip or whitewood we inhal with delight the fragranc that
make notabl the time when the common locust send forth it white
racem of loveli but we miss mani of us the flower of the
oak in earli spring and we do not realiz that thi famili of tree
most notabl for rug strength ha it bloom of begin at the
other end of the scale in flower of delic color and rather
diminut size
the reason i miss appreci the flower of the oakthei ar quit
new to mefor some year of tree admir wa becaus of the
distract accompani the tree give to the bloom some treesmost
of the mapl for instancesend out their flower boldli ahead of the
foliag and it is thu easi to see what is happen abov your head
as you stroll along drink in the spring nectar of spici air
other again have such showi bloom that the mass of foliag onli
accentu their attract and it is not possibl to miss them
illustr the swamp white oak in winter
but the oak is differ it is as modest as it is strong and it
bloom is nearli surround by the open leav in most season and in
most of the speci i am just begin to be acquaint with then
too these open leav ar of such indescrib colorsif the
delic chromat tint thei reflect to the ey mai be so strongli
namedthat thei harmon and do not contrast with the flower it is
with them almost as with a fearless chipmunk whose acquaint i
cultiv on summerh wa gai with stripe of soft color yet he so
fit ani surround he chose to be in that when he wa quiet he
simpli disappear the oak flower and it exquisit unfold of
young foliag combin in on effect and it is an effect so beauti
that on easili fail to separ it part or to see which of the mass
of soft pink grai yellow and green is bloom and which of it is
leafag
illustr flower of the pinoak
take the pinoak for instanc and note the soft of the greeneri
abov it flower hardli can we defin the young leav as greenthei
ar all tint and all beauti thi same pinoak by the wai i mean
the on the botanist call quercu palustri is a notabl
contradict of the accept theori that an oak of size and digniti
cannot be rear in a lifetim there ar hundr of lusti pinoak all
over the eastern state that ar shade the home of the wise men who
plant them in youth and thei might well adorn our park and avenu
in place of mani far less beauti and perman tree with ordinari
care and in good soil the pinoak grow rapidli and the
characterist spread habit and the slightli downdroop branch
ar alwai attract in it ag it ha not the rugged of it kin
though it assum a state and somewhat formal habit and i must
confess accumul some rag dead branch in it interior
thi ragged is easili care for for the tree requiresand few
tree dono trim of it outer branch the interior twig that
the rapid growth of the tree ha depriv of air and light can be
quickli and easili remov in washington where streettre plant
ha been and is intellig manag under central author the
avenu of pinoak ar a splendid featur of the great boulevard which
ar serv alreadi as a model to the whole countri let us plant oak
and reliev the monotoni of too mani mapl poplar and horsechestnut
along our citi and villag highwai
i like too to see the smooth littl acorn of the pinoak befor the
leav drop thei seem so finish and altogeth pleas and with the
leav make a classic decor motiv worth more attent from
design
while i am innoc of either abil or intent to write botan of
the great oak famili i ought perhap to transcrib the inform that
the flower we seeif we look just at the right time in the
springar known as stamin catkinswhich be interpret
mean that there ar also pistil flower much less conspicu but
exceedingli necessari if acorn ar to result and also the fact that
the familiar pussywillow of our acquaint is the same form of
bloomth catkin or ament i ought to sai too that some of the oak
perfect acorn from blossom in on year while other must grow through
two season befor thei ar matur botan the oak famili is
nearli a world famili and we american though possess of mani
speci have no monopoli of it inde if i mai dare to refer the
reader to that great storehous of word the encyclopdia britannica i
think he will find that the oak is there veri british and that the
english oak sure a magnific tree in england anywai is
patriot glorifi to the writer
but we want to talk of some of our own oak the on thoroughli
characterist is sure the nobl white oak a tree most admir in
everi wai and most wide distribut over the northern state it
majest form as it tower high abov the ordinari work of man
convei the repos of consciou strength to the behold there is a
great oak in connecticut to which i make pilgrimag and from which i
alwai get a messag of rest and peac there it stand strong
fullpow mind littl the most furiou storm a benedict to
everi on who will but lift hi ey there it ha stood in full majesti
for year unknown for it wa a great oak so run the titlede wai
back in 1636 when first the white man began to own land in the
connecticut vallei at first sight it seem not larg for it perfect
symmetri conceal it great size but it impress grow as on look
at it until it seem to fill the whole landscap i have sat under it

the mysteri in it sturdi heart overhead when the full moon rode in the
sky and alwai that great oak of glastonburi ha sooth and cheer
and rest and taken me nearer the giver of all such good to restless
human
do i wonder at my friend who ha built hi home where he mai look alwai
at thi white oak or that he rage in anger when a crab neighbor
ruthlessli cut down a superb tree of the same kind that wa on hi
properti line in order that he might run hi barbedwir fenc
straight no i agre with him that thi treemurder ha probabl a

treeless at least
illustr the swamp white oak in earli spring
sometim thi same white oak adapt itself to the bank of a stream
though it true charact develop best in the drier ground it
strength ha been it bane for the valu of it timber ha caus mani
a great isol specimen to be cut down it is fine to know that some
statesmassachusett connecticut and rhode island also i thinkhav
given to tree along highwai and in situat where thei ar part of
the highwai landscap the protect of a wise law under thi law each
town appoint a treewarden serv without pai and therefor with

common possess regardless of whose land thei happen to be on if the
owner desir to cut down a tree thu design he must first obtain
permiss after state satisfactori reason of the annual
townmeet and thi is not so easi as to make cut veri frequent
the whole countri should have such a law and i should enjoi it
applic right here in pennsylvania where oak of a hundr year
have been cut down to make room for a whiski sign and where a superb
pinoak that i pass todai is devot to an ignomini us if i mai
ventur to becom hortatori let me sai that the respons for the
preserv of the alltoofew remain great primev tree and of
their often notabl progeni in our eastern state rest with those who
care for tree not alon with those who ought to care to talk about
the great and beauti of a fine oak or mapl or tulip to call
attent to it shade valu and to appeal to the cupid of the
ground owner by estim how much less hi properti will be worth
when the tree ar gone or have been mishandl will aid to creat the
necessari public sentiment and to provid wise law as mai be often
done with proper attent is the plain duti and the high privileg of
the treelov citizen the tree ar defenseless and thei ar often
unreplac if you love them protect them as you would your children
the whiteoak leaf is the most familiar and characterist perhap of

it ha been said that a proper penanc for an offend botanist would
be a compulsori separ and descript of the involv and
complic goldenrod famili and i would suggest that a second edit
of the same penanc might be a requir to name offhand the first
dozen oak tree the same poor botanist might meet so much do the

the differ between individu of the same speci that the wisest

it mai be that the forlorn jew did hang their harp upon the tree we

that the weep willow is distinctli unadapt to us as a harprack
and on is at a loss to know just how the instrument in question would

the two superb elm known as paul and virginia that make notabl the
north shore of the susquehanna at wilkesbarr ar subject of local
pride which seem howev not strong enough to prevent the erect

can be no doubt howev that the sentiment of rever for great

spread westward and southward from new england it give me keen

visit on busi struck hand with me on treelov and took me to
see hi pet liquidambar at the edg of a millpond that on wa taller

but a word more about the liquidambarth name by which i hope the tree
we ar discuss mai be talk of and thought of old linnu gave it
that name becaus it describ euphoni as well as scientif
the fact that the sap which exud from thi fine american tree is
liquid amber now isnt that better than gum tree
with tree in gener as object of interest i have alwai felt a
special lean toward tropic tree probabl becaus thei were rare
and inde not to be seen outsid of the conservatori in our middl
state my first visit to florida wa made particularli enjoy by
reason of the palm and banana there to be seen and i have by no mean
lost the feel of admir for the latter especi in yucatan
there were to be seen other and stranger growth and fruit and the

it wa therefor with some astonish that i came to know a few
year ago more of a littl tree bear a fruit that had been familiar

fairli call the american banana the papaw it wa a fruit all too

fruit of the god or jove fruit if hi high of olympu wa
by ani chanc well acquaint with our simmon just befor frost he
must have had a copperlin mouth to choos it as hi peculiar fruit
make a moderates tree of peculiar and pleas form it branch
twist regardless of symmetri the persimmon in pennsylvania like
the countri roadsid especi along loami bank here it ha
unequ opportun for hang out it attract color fruit
as on drive along in earli fall just befor hard frost these
finelook littl tomatolik globe of orang and red ar advertis
in the wind by the absenc of the earli drop foliag thei look
lusciou and tempt inde thei ar tempt past experiencey
need but onehad prepar me for thi bunko fruit but my friend
would not believ me on dai in earli octoberh must tast for
himself tast he did and gener for the first bite is pleas
and doe not alarm wherefor he had time befor hi insult nerv of
mouth and tongu gave full warn to absorb two of the simmon whew
what a face he made when the pucker juic got to work and convinc
him that he had been suck a disguis lump of alum choke and
gasp he call for the water we were far from and he wont try an
unfrost persimmon again
my cleric friend who brought home the fairi tale about the redbud
or judastre might well have base hi stori on the american
persimmon but for the fact that thi puckeri littl globe so brilliant
and so decept befor frost lose both it beauti and it astring
when slightli frozen then it tender flesh is suav and delici and
old jove might well choos it for hi own
illustr the persimmon tree in fruit time
but the treethat is a beauti all summer with it shine leav
oblong point and almost of the magnolia shape it will grace ani
situat and is particularli on of the tree worth plant along
highwai to reliev the monotoni of too mani mapl ash
horsechestnut and the like and to offer to the passerbi a tempt
fruit of which he will sure not partak too freeli when it is most
attract i read that toward the western limit of it rang the
persimmon in louisiana eastern kansa and the indian territori
becom anoth tree of the first magnitud tower abov a hundr
feet thi would be well worth see
there is anoth persimmon in the south introduc from japan the
fruit of which ar sold on the fruitstand of philadelphia boston
and new york thi the kaki of japan is a small but businesslik
tree not substanti hardi north of georgia which provid great
quantiti of it beauti fruit rich in color and sweet to the
tast and vari greatli in size and form in it differ varieti
these simmon do not need the touch of frost nor do thei ever attain
the fine wild high flavor of the frostbitten virginian fruit the
tree that bear them ha none of the irregular beauti of our nativ
persimmon nor doe it approach in size to that ornament of the
countrysid
and now in close these sketch i becom most keenli sensibl of
their defici pure random bit thei ar come from a busi man
and possess the on merit of frank deepli interest in tree
but lack the time for continu studi i have been turn my camera
and my ey upon the growth about me ask question mental
record what i could see and while thank for the rest and the
pleasur of the pursuit alwai sorri not to go more fulli into proper
and scientif tree knowledg at time my lack in thi respect ha made
me asham to have written at all upon tree but with full gratitud to
the botan explor whose labor have made such superfici
observ as mine possibl i ventur to send forth these sketch
without pretens as to the statement of ani new fact or featur
illustr berri of the spicebush
if anyth i have here set down shall induc among those who have
