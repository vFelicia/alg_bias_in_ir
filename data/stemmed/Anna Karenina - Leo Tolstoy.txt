stepan arkadyevitch wa on familiar term with almost all hi
acquaint and call almost all of them by their christian name
old men of sixti boi of twenti actor minist merchant and
adjutantgener so that mani of hi intim chum were to be found
at the extrem end of the social ladder and would have been veri much
surpris to learn that thei had through the medium of oblonski
someth in common he wa the familiar friend of everyon with whom
he took a glass of champagn and he took a glass of champagn with
everyon and when in consequ he met ani of hi disreput chum
as he us in joke to call mani of hi friend in the presenc of hi
subordin he well knew how with hi characterist tact to
diminish the disagre impress made on them levin wa not a
disreput chum but oblonski with hi readi tact felt that levin
fanci he might not care to show hi intimaci with him befor hi
subordin and so he made hast to take him off into hi room
levin wa almost of the same ag as oblonski their intimaci did not
rest mere on champagn levin had been the friend and companion of
hi earli youth thei were fond of on anoth in spite of the
differ of their charact and tast as friend ar fond of on
anoth who have been togeth in earli youth but in spite of thi
each of thema is often the wai with men who have select career of
differ kindsthough in discuss he would even justifi the other
career in hi heart despis it it seem to each of them that the
life he led himself wa the onli real life and the life led by hi
friend wa a mere phantasm oblonski could not restrain a slight
mock smile at the sight of levin how often he had seen him come up
to moscow from the countri where he wa do someth but what
precis stepan arkadyevitch could never quit make out and inde he
took no interest in the matter levin arriv in moscow alwai excit
and in a hurri rather ill at eas and irrit by hi own want of
eas and for the most part with a perfectli new unexpect view of
thing stepan arkadyevitch laugh at thi and like it in the same
wai levin in hi heart despis the town mode of life of hi friend
and hi offici duti which he laugh at and regard as trifl
but the differ wa that oblonski as he wa do the same as
everyon did laugh complac and goodhumoredli while levin
laugh without complac and sometim angrili

chapter 6
when oblonski ask levin what had brought him to town levin blush
and wa furiou with himself for blush becaus he could not answer
i have come to make your sisterinlaw an offer though that wa
precis what he had come for
the famili of the levin and the shtcherbatski were old nobl
moscow famili and had alwai been on intim and friendli term
thi intimaci had grown still closer dure levin student dai he
had both prepar for the univers with the young princ
shtcherbatski the brother of kitti and dolli and had enter at the
same time with him in those dai levin us often to be in the
shtcherbatski hous and he wa in love with the shtcherbatski
household strang as it mai appear it wa with the household the
famili that konstantin levin wa in love especi with the feminin
half of the household levin did not rememb hi own mother and hi
onli sister wa older than he wa so that it wa in the
shtcherbatski hous that he saw for the first time that inner life of
an old nobl cultiv and honor famili of which he had been
depriv by the death of hi father and mother all the member of that
famili especi the feminin half were pictur by him as it were
wrap about with a mysteri poetic veil and he not onli
perceiv no defect whatev in them but under the poetic veil that
shroud them he assum the exist of the loftiest sentiment and
everi possibl perfect why it wa the three young ladi had on
dai to speak french and the next english why it wa that at certain
hour thei plai by turn on the piano the sound of which were
audibl in their brother room abov where the student us to work
why thei were visit by those professor of french literatur of
music of draw of danc why at certain hour all the three young
ladi with mademoisel linon drove in the coach to the tverski
boulevard dress in their satin cloak dolli in a long on natalia
in a halflong on and kitti in on so short that her shape leg in
tightlydrawn red stock were visibl to all behold why it wa
thei had to walk about the tverski boulevard escort by a footman with
a gold cockad in hi hatal thi and much more that wa done in their
mysteri world he did not understand but he wa sure that everyth
that wa done there wa veri good and he wa in love precis with
the mysteri of the proceed
in hi student dai he had all but been in love with the eldest dolli
but she wa soon marri to oblonski then he began be in love with
the second he felt as it were that he had to be in love with on of
the sister onli he could not quit make out which but natalia too
had hardli made her appear in the world when she marri the
diplomat lvov kitti wa still a child when levin left the univers
young shtcherbatski went into the navi wa drown in the baltic and
levin relat with the shtcherbatski in spite of hi friendship
with oblonski becam less intim but when earli in the winter of
thi year levin came to moscow after a year in the countri and saw
the shtcherbatski he realiz which of the three sister he wa
inde destin to love
on would have thought that noth could be simpler than for him a
man of good famili rather rich than poor and thirtytwo year old to
make the young princess shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriag in all
likelihood he would at onc have been look upon as a good match but
levin wa in love and so it seem to him that kitti wa so perfect in
everi respect that she wa a creatur far abov everyth earthli and
that he wa a creatur so low and so earthli that it could not even be
conceiv that other peopl and she herself could regard him as worthi
of her
after spend two month in moscow in a state of enchant see
kitti almost everi dai in societi into which he went so as to meet
her he abruptli decid that it could not be and went back to the
countri
levin convict that it could not be wa found on the idea that in
the ey of her famili he wa a disadvantag and worthless match for
the charm kitti and that kitti herself could not love him in her
famili ey he had no ordinari definit career and posit in
societi while hi contemporari by thi time when he wa thirtytwo
were alreadi on a colonel and anoth a professor anoth director
of a bank and railwai or presid of a board like oblonski but he
he knew veri well how he must appear to other wa a countri
gentleman occupi in breed cattl shoot game and build
barn in other word a fellow of no abil who had not turn out
well and who wa do just what accord to the idea of the world
is done by peopl fit for noth els
the mysteri enchant kitti herself could not love such an ugli
person as he conceiv himself to be and abov all such an ordinari
in no wai strike person moreov hi attitud to kitti in the
pastth attitud of a grownup person to a child aris from hi
friendship with her brotherseem to him yet anoth obstacl to love
an ugli goodnatur man as he consid himself might he
suppos be like as a friend but to be love with such a love as
that with which he love kitti on would need to be a handsom and
still more a distinguish man
he had heard that women often did care for ugli and ordinari men but
he did not believ it for he judg by himself and he could not
himself have love ani but beauti mysteri and except
women
but after spend two month alon in the countri he wa convinc
that thi wa not on of those passion of which he had had experi
in hi earli youth that thi feel gave him not an instant rest
that he could not live without decid the question would she or
would she not be hi wife and that hi despair had arisen onli from
hi own imagin that he had no sort of proof that he would be
reject and he had now come to moscow with a firm determin to
make an offer and get marri if he were accept or he could not
conceiv what would becom of him if he were reject
chapter 7
on arriv in moscow by a morn train levin had put up at the hous
of hi elder halfbroth koznishev after chang hi cloth he
went down to hi brother studi intend to talk to him at onc
about the object of hi visit and to ask hi advic but hi brother
wa not alon with him there wa a wellknown professor of philosophi
who had come from harkov expressli to clear up a differ that had
arisen between them on a veri import philosoph question the
professor wa carri on a hot crusad against materialist sergei
koznishev had been follow thi crusad with interest and after
read the professor last articl he had written him a letter
state hi object he accus the professor of make too great
concess to the materialist and the professor had promptli
appear to argu the matter out the point in discuss wa the
question then in vogu is there a line to be drawn between
psycholog and physiolog phenomena in man and if so where
sergei ivanovitch met hi brother with the smile of chilli friendli
he alwai had for everyon and introduc him to the professor went
on with the convers
a littl man in spectacl with a narrow forehead tore himself from
the discuss for an instant to greet levin and then went on talk
without pai ani further attent to him levin sat down to wait
till the professor should go but he soon began to get interest in
the subject under discuss
levin had come across the magazin articl about which thei were
disput and had read them interest in them as a develop of
the first principl of scienc familiar to him as a natur scienc
student at the univers but he had never connect these scientif
deduct as to the origin of man as an anim as to reflex action
biologi and sociolog with those question as to the mean of life
and death to himself which had of late been more and more often in hi
mind
as he listen to hi brother argument with the professor he notic
that thei connect these scientif question with those spiritu
problem that at time thei almost touch on the latter but everi
time thei were close upon what seem to him the chief point thei
promptli beat a hasti retreat and plung again into a sea of subtl
distinct reserv quotat allus and appeal to
author and it wa with difficulti that he understood what thei
were talk about
i cannot admit it said sergei ivanovitch with hi habitu
clear precis of express and eleg of phrase i cannot
in ani case agre with keiss that my whole concept of the extern
world ha been deriv from percept the most fundament idea the
idea of exist ha not been receiv by me through sensat
inde there is no special senseorgan for the transmiss of such an
idea
ye but theywurt and knaust and pripasovwould answer that your
conscious of exist is deriv from the conjunct of all your
sensat that that conscious of exist is the result of your
sensat wurt inde sai plainli that assum there ar no
sensat it follow that there is no idea of exist
i maintain the contrari began sergei ivanovitch
but here it seem to levin that just as thei were close upon the real
point of the matter thei were again retreat and he made up hi
mind to put a question to the professor
accord to that if my sens ar annihil if my bodi is dead i
can have no exist of ani sort he queri
the professor in annoy and as it were mental suffer at the
interrupt look round at the strang inquir more like a
bargeman than a philosoph and turn hi ey upon sergei
ivanovitch as though to ask what on to sai to him but sergei
ivanovitch who had been talk with far less heat and onesided
than the professor and who had suffici breadth of mind to answer
the professor and at the same time to comprehend the simpl and
natur point of view from which the question wa put smile and said
that question we have no right to answer as yet
we have not the requisit data chime in the professor and he went
back to hi argument no he said i would point out the fact that
if as pripasov directli assert percept is base on sensat
then we ar bound to distinguish sharpli between these two
concept
levin listen no more and simpli wait for the professor to go
chapter 8
when the professor had gone sergei ivanovitch turn to hi brother
delight that youv come for some time is it how your farm
get on
levin knew that hi elder brother took littl interest in farm and
onli put the question in defer to him and so he onli told him
about the sale of hi wheat and monei matter
levin had meant to tell hi brother of hi determin to get
marri and to ask hi advic he had inde firmli resolv to do so
but after see hi brother listen to hi convers with the
professor hear afterward the unconsci patron tone in
which hi brother question him about agricultur matter their
mother properti had not been divid and levin took charg of both
their share levin felt that he could not for some reason begin to
talk to him of hi intent of marri he felt that hi brother
would not look at it as he would have wish him to
well how is your district council do ask sergei ivanovitch
who wa greatli interest in these local board and attach great
import to them
i realli dont know
what why sure your a member of the board
no im not a member now iv resign answer levin and i no
longer attend the meet
what a piti comment sergei ivanovitch frown
levin in selfdefens began to describ what took place in the meet
in hi district
that how it alwai is sergei ivanovitch interrupt him we
russian ar alwai like that perhap it our strong point realli
the faculti of see our own shortcom but we overdo it we
comfort ourselv with ironi which we alwai have on the tip of our
tongu all i sai is give such right as our local selfgovern to
ani other european peoplewhi the german or the english would have
work their wai to freedom from them while we simpli turn them into
ridicul
but how can it be help said levin penit it wa my last
effort and i did try with all my soul i cant im no good at it
it not that your no good at it said sergei ivanovitch it is
that you dont look at it as you should

stepan arkadyevitch ey sparkl more than usual
why not a roll will sometim smell so good on cant resist it
himmlisch ist wenn ich bezwungen
mein irdisch begier
aber doch wenn nich gelungen
hatt ich auch recht hbsch plaisir
as he said thi stepan arkadyevitch smile subtli levin too could
not help smile
ye but joke apart resum stepan arkadyevitch you must
understand that the woman is a sweet gentl love creatur poor and
lone and ha sacrif everyth now when the thing done
dont you see can on possibl cast her off even suppos on part
from her so as not to break up on famili life still can on help
feel for her set her on her feet soften her lot
well you must excus me there you know to me all women ar divid
into two class at least no truer to sai there ar women and
there ar iv never seen exquisit fallen be and i never
shall see them but such creatur as that paint frenchwoman at the
counter with the ringlet ar vermin to my mind and all fallen women
ar the same
but the magdalen
ah drop that christ would never have said those word if he had
known how thei would be abus of all the gospel those word ar the
onli on rememb howev im not sai so much what i think as
what i feel i have a loath for fallen women your afraid of
spider and i of these vermin most like youv not made a studi of
spider and dont know their charact and so it is with me
it veri well for you to talk like that it veri much like that
gentleman in dicken who us to fling all difficult question over hi
right shoulder but to deni the fact is no answer what to be
doney tell me that what to be done your wife get older while
your full of life befor youv time to look round you feel that
you cant love your wife with love howev much you mai esteem her
and then all at onc love turn up and your done for done for
stepan arkadyevitch said with weari despair
levin half smile
ye your done for resum oblonski but what to be done
dont steal roll
stepan arkadyevitch laugh outright
oh moralist but you must understand there ar two women on
insist onli on her right and those right ar your love which you
cant give her and the other sacrific everyth for you and ask
for noth what ar you to do how ar you to act there a fear
tragedi in it
if you care for my profess of faith as regard that ill tell you
that i dont believ there wa ani tragedi about it and thi is why
to my mind love both the sort of love which you rememb plato
defin in hi banquet serv as the test of men some men onli
understand on sort and some onli the other and those who onli know
the nonplaton love have no need to talk of tragedi in such love
there can be no sort of tragedi im much oblig for the
gratif my humbl respectsthat all the tragedi and in
platon love there can be no tragedi becaus in that love all is
clear and pure becaus
at that instant levin recollect hi own sin and the inner conflict
he had live through and he ad unexpectedli
but perhap you ar right veri like i dont know i dont
know
it thi dont you see said stepan arkadyevitch your veri much
all of a piec that your strong point and your fail you have a
charact that all of a piec and you want the whole of life to be
of a piec toobut that not how it is you despis public offici
work becaus you want the realiti to be invari correspond all
the while with the aimand that not how it is you want a man work
too alwai to have a defin aim and love and famili life alwai to
be undividedand that not how it is all the varieti all the charm
all the beauti of life is made up of light and shadow
levin sigh and made no repli he wa think of hi own affair and
did not hear oblonski
and suddenli both of them felt that though thei were friend though
thei had been dine and drink togeth which should have drawn
them closer yet each wa think onli of hi own affair and thei
had noth to do with on anoth oblonski had more than onc
experienc thi extrem sens of aloof instead of intimaci
come on after dinner and he knew what to do in such case
bill he call and he went into the next room where he promptli
came across an aidedecamp of hi acquaint and drop into
convers with him about an actress and her protector and at onc
in the convers with the aidedecamp oblonski had a sens of
relax and relief after the convers with levin which alwai
put him to too great a mental and spiritu strain
when the tatar appear with a bill for twentysix roubl and odd
kopeck besid a tip for himself levin who would anoth time have
been horrifi like anyon from the countri at hi share of fourteen
roubl did not notic it paid and set off homeward to dress and go
to the shtcherbatski there to decid hi fate

princess wa delight and said to her husband triumphantli you see
i wa right when vronski appear on the scene she wa still more
delight confirm in her opinion that kitti wa to make not simpli a
good but a brilliant match
in the mother ey there could be no comparison between vronski and
levin she dislik in levin hi strang and uncompromis opinion
and hi shyness in societi found as she suppos on hi pride and
hi queer sort of life as she consid it absorb in cattl and
peasant she did not veri much like it that he who wa in love with
her daughter had kept come to the hous for six week as though he
were wait for someth inspect as though he were afraid he
might be do them too great an honor by make an offer and did not
realiz that a man who continu visit at a hous where there is a
young unmarri girl is bound to make hi intent clear and
suddenli without do so he disappear it as well he not
attract enough for kitti to have fallen in love with him thought
the mother
vronski satisfi all the mother desir veri wealthi clever of
aristocrat famili on the highroad to a brilliant career in the armi
and at court and a fascin man noth better could be wish
for
vronski openli flirt with kitti at ball danc with her and came
continu to the hous consequ there could be no doubt of the
serious of hi intent but in spite of that the mother had
spent the whole of that winter in a state of terribl anxieti and
agit
princess shtcherbatskaya had herself been marri thirti year ago her
aunt arrang the match her husband about whom everyth wa well
known beforehand had come look at hi futur bride and been look
at the matchmak aunt had ascertain and commun their mutual
impress that impress had been favor afterward on a dai
fix beforehand the expect offer wa made to her parent and
accept all had pass veri simpli and easili so it seem at
least to the princess but over her own daughter she had felt how far
from simpl and easi is the busi appar so commonplac of
marri off on daughter the panic that had been live through
the thought that had been brood over the monei that had been
wast and the disput with her husband over marri the two elder
girl darya and natalia now sinc the youngest had come out she wa
go through the same terror the same doubt and still more violent
quarrel with her husband than she had over the elder girl the old
princ like all father inde wa exceedingli punctili on the
score of the honor and reput of hi daughter he wa irration
jealou over hi daughter especi over kitti who wa hi
favorit at everi turn he had scene with the princess for
compromis her daughter the princess had grown accustom to thi
alreadi with her other daughter but now she felt that there wa more
ground for the princ touchi she saw that of late year much wa
chang in the manner of societi that a mother duti had becom
still more difficult she saw that girl of kitti ag form some
sort of club went to some sort of lectur mix freeli in men
societi drove about the street alon mani of them did not curtsei
and what wa the most import thing all the girl were firmli
convinc that to choos their husband wa their own affair and not
their parent marriag arent made nowadai as thei us to be
wa thought and said by all these young girl and even by their
elder but how marriag were made now the princess could not learn
from anyon the french fashionof the parent arrang their
children futurewa not accept it wa condemn the english
fashion of the complet independ of girl wa also not accept
and not possibl in russian societi the russian fashion of matchmak
by the offic of intermedi person wa for some reason consid
unseemli it wa ridicul by everyon and by the princess herself
but how girl were to be marri and how parent were to marri them
no on knew everyon with whom the princess had chanc to discuss the
matter said the same thing merci on us it high time in our dai to
cast off all that oldfashion busi it the young peopl have to
marri and not their parent and so we ought to leav the young peopl
to arrang it as thei choos it wa veri easi for anyon to sai that
who had no daughter but the princess realiz that in the process of
get to know each other her daughter might fall in love and fall
in love with someon who did not care to marri her or who wa quit
unfit to be her husband and howev much it wa instil into the
princess that in our time young peopl ought to arrang their live
for themselv she wa unabl to believ it just as she would have
been unabl to believ that at ani time whatev the most suitabl
playth for children five year old ought to be load pistol and
so the princess wa more uneasi over kitti than she had been over her
elder sister
now she wa afraid that vronski might confin himself to simpli
flirt with her daughter she saw that her daughter wa in love with
him but tri to comfort herself with the thought that he wa an
honor man and would not do thi but at the same time she knew how
easi it is with the freedom of manner of todai to turn a girl
head and how lightli men gener regard such a crime the week
befor kitti had told her mother of a convers she had with
vronski dure a mazurka thi convers had partli reassur the
princess but perfectli at eas she could not be vronski had told
kitti that both he and hi brother were so us to obei their mother
that thei never made up their mind to ani import undertak
without consult her and just now i am impati await my
mother arriv from petersburg as peculiarli fortun he told
her
kitti had repeat thi without attach ani signific to the
word but her mother saw them in a differ light she knew that the
old ladi wa expect from dai to dai that she would be pleas at her
son choic and she felt it strang that he should not make hi offer
through fear of vex hi mother howev she wa so anxiou for the
marriag itself and still more for relief from her fear that she
believ it wa so bitter as it wa for the princess to see the
unhappi of her eldest daughter dolli on the point of leav her
husband her anxieti over the decis of her youngest daughter fate
engross all her feel todai with levin reappear a fresh
sourc of anxieti aros she wa afraid that her daughter who had at
on time as she fanci a feel for levin might from extrem
sens of honor refus vronski and that levin arriv might
gener complic and delai the affair so near be conclud
why ha he been here long the princess ask about levin as thei
return home

seriou and alert face kitti guess what it would be

mother smile at her agit and happi the princess smile
that what wa take place just now in her soul seem to the poor
child so immens and so import
chapter 13
after dinner and till the begin of the even kitti wa feel
a sensat akin to the sensat of a young man befor a battl her
heart throb violent and her thought would not rest on anyth
she felt that thi even when thei would both meet for the first
time would be a turn point in her life and she wa continu
pictur them to herself at on moment each separ and then both
togeth when she muse on the past she dwelt with pleasur with
tender on the memori of her relat with levin the memori
of childhood and of levin friendship with her dead brother gave a
special poetic charm to her relat with him hi love for her of
which she felt certain wa flatter and delight to her and it
wa pleasant for her to think of levin in her memori of vronski
there alwai enter a certain element of awkward though he wa in
the highest degre wellbr and at eas as though there were some
fals notenot in vronski he wa veri simpl and nice but in herself
while with levin she felt perfectli simpl and clear but on the other
hand directli she thought of the futur with vronski there aros
befor her a perspect of brilliant happi with levin the futur
seem misti
when she went upstair to dress and look into the lookingglass she
notic with joi that it wa on of her good dai and that she wa in
complet possess of all her forcessh need thi so for what lai
befor her she wa consciou of extern composur and free grace in
her movement
at halfpast seven she had onli just gone down into the drawingroom
when the footman announc konstantin dmitrievitch levin the
princess wa still in her room and the princ had not come in so it
is to be thought kitti and all the blood seem to rush to her
heart she wa horrifi at her pale as she glanc into the
lookingglass at that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come
earli on purpos to find her alon and to make her an offer and onli
then for the first time the whole thing present itself in a new
differ aspect onli then she realiz that the question did not
affect her onlywith whom she would be happi and whom she lovedbut
that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she like and to
wound him cruelli what for becaus he dear fellow love her wa in
love with her but there wa no help for it so it must be so it would
have to be
my god shall i myself realli have to sai it to him she thought
can i tell him i dont love him that will be a lie what am i to sai
to him that i love someon els no that imposs im go
awai im go awai
she had reach the door when she heard hi step no it not
honest what have i to be afraid of i have done noth wrong what is
to be will be ill tell the truth and with him on cant be ill at
eas here he is she said to herself see hi power shy
figur with hi shine ey fix on her she look straight into
hi face as though implor him to spare her and gave her hand
it not time yet i think im too earli he said glanc round the
empti drawingroom when he saw that hi expect were realiz
that there wa noth to prevent him from speak hi face becam
gloomi
oh no said kitti and sat down at the tabl
but thi wa just what i want to find you alon he began not
sit down and not look at her so as not to lose courag
mamma will be down directli she wa veri much tire

she talk on not know what her lip were utter and not take
her supplic and caress ey off him
he glanc at her she blush and ceas speak

depend on you
she drop her head lower and lower not know herself what answer
she should make to what wa come
that it depend on you he repeat i meant to sai i meant to
sai i came for thi to be my wife he brought out not know
what he wa sai but feel that the most terribl thing wa said
he stop short and look at her
she wa breath heavili not look at him she wa feel ecstasi
her soul wa flood with happi she had never anticip that the
utter of love would produc such a power effect on her but it
last onli an instant she rememb vronski she lift her clear
truth ey and see hi desper face she answer hastili
that cannot be forgiv me
a moment ago and how close she had been to him of what import in
hi life and how aloof and remot from him she had becom now
it wa bound to be so he said not look at her
he bow and wa mean to retreat
chapter 14
but at that veri moment the princess came in there wa a look of
horror on her face when she saw them alon and their disturb face
levin bow to her and said noth kitti did not speak nor lift her
ey thank god she ha refus him thought the mother and her
face light up with the habitu smile with which she greet her
guest on thursdai she sat down and began question levin about hi
life in the countri he sat down again wait for other visitor to
arriv in order to retreat unnot
five minut later there came in a friend of kitti marri the
preced winter countess nordston
she wa a thin sallow sickli and nervou woman with brilliant black
ey she wa fond of kitti and her affect for her show itself
as the affect of marri women for girl alwai doe in the desir
to make a match for kitti after her own ideal of marri happi she
want her to marri vronski levin she had often met at the
shtcherbatski earli in the winter and she had alwai dislik him
her invari and favorit pursuit when thei met consist in make
fun of him
i do like it when he look down at me from the height of hi grandeur
or break off hi learn convers with me becaus im a fool or
is condescend to me i like that so to see him condescend i am
so glad he cant bear me she us to sai of him
she wa right for levin actual could not bear her and despis her
for what she wa proud of and regard as a fine characteristich
nervous her delic contempt and indiffer for everyth
coars and earthli
the countess nordston and levin got into that relat with on anoth
not seldom seen in societi when two person who remain extern on
friendli term despis each other to such a degre that thei cannot
even take each other serious and cannot even be offend by each
other
the countess nordston pounc upon levin at onc
ah konstantin dmitrievitch so youv come back to our corrupt
babylon she said give him her tini yellow hand and recal
what he had chanc to sai earli in the winter that moscow wa a
babylon come is babylon reform or have you degener she
ad glanc with a simper at kitti
it veri flatter for me countess that you rememb my word so
well respond levin who had succeed in recov hi composur
and at onc from habit drop into hi tone of joke hostil to the
countess nordston thei must certainli make a great impress on
you
oh i should think so i alwai note them all down well kitti have
you been skate again
and she began talk to kitti awkward as it wa for levin to withdraw
now it would still have been easier for him to perpetr thi
awkward than to remain all the even and see kitti who glanc
at him now and then and avoid hi ey he wa on the point of
get up when the princess notic that he wa silent address
him
shall you be long in moscow your busi with the district council
though arent you and cant be awai for long
no princess im no longer a member of the council he said i have
come up for a few dai

mood but ill draw him out i do love make a fool of him befor
kitti and ill do it
konstantin dmitrievitch she said to him do explain to me pleas
what the mean of it you know all about such thing at home in
our villag of kaluga all the peasant and all the women have drunk up
all thei possess and now thei cant pai us ani rent what the
mean of that you alwai prais the peasant so
at that instant anoth ladi came into the room and levin got up
excus me countess but i realli know noth about it and cant
tell you anyth he said and look round at the offic who came
in behind the ladi
that must be vronski thought levin and to be sure of it glanc
at kitti she had alreadi had time to look at vronski and look round
at levin and simpli from the look in her ey that grew unconsci
brighter levin knew that she love that man knew it as sure as if
she had told him so in word but what sort of a man wa he now
whether for good or for ill levin could not choos but remain he must
find out what the man wa like whom she love
there ar peopl who on meet a success rival no matter in what
ar at onc dispos to turn their back on everyth good in him and
to see onli what is bad there ar peopl on the other hand who
desir abov all to find in that lucki rival the qualiti by which he
ha outstrip them and seek with a throb ach at heart onli what
is good levin belong to the second class but he had no difficulti
in find what wa good and attract in vronski it wa appar at
the first glanc vronski wa a squar built dark man not veri
tall with a goodhumor handsom and exceedingli calm and resolut
face everyth about hi face and figur from hi shortcrop
black hair and freshli shaven chin down to hi loos fit
brandnew uniform wa simpl and at the same time eleg make wai
for the ladi who had come in vronski went up to the princess and then
to kitti
as he approach her hi beauti ey shone with a special tender
light and with a faint happi and modestli triumphant smile so it
seem to levin bow carefulli and respectfulli over her he held
out hi small broad hand to her
greet and sai a few word to everyon he sat down without onc
glanc at levin who had never taken hi ey off him
let me introduc you said the princess indic levin
konstantin dmitrievitch levin count alexei kirillovitch vronski
vronski got up and look cordial at levin shook hand with him
i believ i wa to have dine with you thi winter he said smile
hi simpl and open smile but you had unexpectedli left for the
countri
konstantin dmitrievitch despis and hate town and us townspeopl
said countess nordston
my word must make a deep impress on you sinc you rememb them
so well said levin and suddenli consciou that he had said just the
same thing befor he redden
vronski look at levin and countess nordston and smile
ar you alwai in the countri he inquir i should think it must
be dull in the winter
it not dull if on ha work to do besid on not dull by
oneself levin repli abruptli
i am fond of the countri said vronski notic and affect not
to notic levin tone
but i hope count you would not consent to live in the countri
alwai said countess nordston
i dont know i have never tri for long i experienc a queer
feel onc he went on i never long so for the countri russian
countri with bast shoe and peasant as when i wa spend a winter
with my mother in nice nice itself is dull enough you know and
inde napl and sorrento ar onli pleasant for a short time and
it just there that russia come back to me most vividli and
especi the countri it as though
he talk on address both kitti and levin turn hi seren
friendli ey from on to the other and sai obvious just what
came into hi head
notic that countess nordston want to sai someth he stop
short without finish what he had begun and listen attent to
her
the convers did not flag for an instant so that the princess who
alwai kept in reserv in case a subject should be lack two heavi
gunsth rel advantag of classic and of modern educ and
univers militari servicehad not to move out either of them while
countess nordston had not a chanc of chaf levin
levin want to and could not take part in the gener convers
sai to himself everi instant now go he still did not go as
though wait for someth
the convers fell upon tableturn and spirit and countess
nordston who believ in spiritu began to describ the marvel
she had seen
ah countess you realli must take me for piti sake do take me to
see them i have never seen anyth extraordinari though i am alwai
on the lookout for it everywher said vronski smile
veri well next saturdai answer countess nordston but you
konstantin dmitrievitch do you believ in it she ask levin
why do you ask me you know what i shall sai
but i want to hear your opinion
my opinion answer levin is onli that thi tableturn simpli
prove that educ societyso calledi no higher than the peasant
thei believ in the evil ey and in witchcraft and omen while
we
oh then you dont believ in it
i cant believ in it countess
but if iv seen it myself
the peasant women too tell us thei have seen goblin
then you think i tell a lie
and she laugh a mirthless laugh
oh no masha konstantin dmitrievitch said he could not believ in
it said kitti blush for levin and levin saw thi and still
more exasper would have answer but vronski with hi bright
frank smile rush to the support of the convers which wa
threaten to becom disagre
you do not admit the conceiv at all he queri but why not
we admit the exist of electr of which we know noth why
should there not be some new forc still unknown to us which
when electr wa discov levin interrupt hurriedli it wa
onli the phenomenon that wa discov and it wa unknown from what
it proceed and what were it effect and ag pass befor it
applic were conceiv but the spiritualist have begun with
tabl write for them and spirit appear to them and have onli
later start sai that it is an unknown forc
vronski listen attent to levin as he alwai did listen
obvious interest in hi word
ye but the spiritualist sai we dont know at present what thi
forc is but there is a forc and these ar the condit in which
it act let the scientif men find out what the forc consist in
no i dont see why there should not be a new forc if it
why becaus with electr levin interrupt again everi time
you rub tar against wool a recogn phenomenon is manifest but in
thi case it doe not happen everi time and so it follow it is not a
natur phenomenon
feel probabl that the convers wa take a tone too seriou
for a drawingroom vronski made no rejoind but by wai of try to
chang the convers he smile brightli and turn to the ladi
do let us try at onc countess he said but levin would finish
sai what he thought
i think he went on that thi attempt of the spiritualist to
explain their marvel as some sort of new natur forc is most futil
thei boldli talk of spiritu forc and then try to subject it to
materi experi
everyon wa wait for him to finish and he felt it
and i think you would be a firstrat medium said countess nordston
there someth enthusiast in you
levin open hi mouth wa about to sai someth redden and said
noth
do let us try tableturn at onc pleas said vronski princess
will you allow it
and vronski stood up look for a littl tabl
kitti got up to fetch a tabl and as she pass her ey met levin
she felt for him with her whole heart the more becaus she wa piti
him for suffer of which she wa herself the caus if you can
forgiv me forgiv me said her ey i am so happi

up hi hat but he wa not destin to escap just as thei were
arrang themselv round the tabl and levin wa on the point of

vronski bow and how vronski look with amiabl perplex at her
father as though try and fail to understand how and why anyon
could be hostil dispos toward him and she flush
princ let us have konstantin dmitrievitch said countess nordston
we want to try an experi

gentlemen but to my mind it is better fun to plai the ring game said
the old princ look at vronski and guess that it had been hi

vronski look wonderingli at the princ with hi resolut ey and
with a faint smile began immedi talk to countess nordston of

chapter 16
vronski had never had a real home life hi mother had been in her
youth a brilliant societi woman who had had dure her marri life
and still more afterward mani love affair notori in the whole
fashion world hi father he scarc rememb and he had been
educ in the corp of page
leav the school veri young as a brilliant offic he had at onc
got into the circl of wealthi petersburg armi men although he did go
more or less into petersburg societi hi love affair had alwai
hitherto been outsid it
in moscow he had for the first time felt after hi luxuri and
coars life at petersburg all the charm of intimaci with a sweet and
innoc girl of hi own rank who care for him it never even enter
hi head that there could be ani harm in hi relat with kitti at
ball he danc princip with her he wa a constant visitor at
their hous he talk to her as peopl commonli do talk in societyal
sort of nonsens but nonsens to which he could not help attach a
special mean in her case although he said noth to her that he
could not have said befor everybodi he felt that she wa becom
more and more depend upon him and the more he felt thi the better
he like it and the tender wa hi feel for her he did not know
that hi mode of behavior in relat to kitti had a definit
charact that it is court young girl with no intent of
marriag and that such court is on of the evil action common
among brilliant young men such as he wa it seem to him that he wa
the first who had discov thi pleasur and he wa enjoi hi
discoveri
if he could have heard what her parent were sai that even if he
could have put himself at the point of view of the famili and have
heard that kitti would be unhappi if he did not marri her he would
have been greatli astonish and would not have believ it he could
not believ that what gave such great and delic pleasur to him and
abov all to her could be wrong still less could he have believ
that he ought to marri
marriag had never present itself to him as a possibl he not
onli dislik famili life but a famili and especi a husband wa
in accord with the view gener in the bachelor world in which he
live conceiv as someth alien repel and abov all
ridicul
but though vronski had not the least suspicion what the parent were
sai he felt on come awai from the shtcherbatski that the secret
spiritu bond which exist between him and kitti had grown so much
stronger that even that some step must be taken but what step could
and ought to be taken he could not imagin
what is so exquisit he thought as he return from the
shtcherbatski carri awai with him as he alwai did a delici
feel of puriti and fresh aris partli from the fact that he

here and ad that he like him so much but kitti did not expect
much from the quadril she look forward with a thrill at her heart
to the mazurka she fanci that in the mazurka everyth must be

mazurka did not troubl her she felt sure she would danc the mazurka
with him as she had done at former ball and refus five young men
sai she wa engag for the mazurka the whole ball up to the last
quadril wa for kitti an enchant vision of delight color
sound and motion she onli sat down when she felt too tire and

of the tiresom young men whom she could not refus she chanc to be
visvi with vronski and anna she had not been near anna again
sinc the begin of the even and now again she saw her suddenli
quit new and surpris she saw in her the sign of that excit
of success she knew so well in herself she saw that she wa
intox with the delight admir she wa excit she knew
that feel and knew it sign and saw them in anna saw the
quiver flash light in her ey and the smile of happi and
excit unconsci plai on her lip and the deliber grace
precis and light of her movement
who she ask herself all or on and not assist the harass
young man she wa danc with in the convers the thread of which
he had lost and could not pick up again she obei with extern
liveli the peremptori shout of korsunski start them all into
the grand rond and then into the chane and at the same time she
kept watch with a grow pang at her heart no it not the
admir of the crowd ha intox her but the ador of on
and that on can it be he everi time he spoke to anna the joyou
light flash into her ey and the smile of happi curv her red
lip she seem to make an effort to control herself to try not to
show these sign of delight but thei came out on her face of
themselv but what of him kitti look at him and wa fill with
terror what wa pictur so clearli to kitti in the mirror of anna
face she saw in him what had becom of hi alwai selfpossess
resolut manner and the carelessli seren express of hi face now
everi time he turn to her he bent hi head as though he would have
fallen at her feet and in hi ey there wa noth but humbl
submiss and dread i would not offend you hi ey seem everi
time to be sai but i want to save myself and i dont know how
on hi face wa a look such as kitti had never seen befor
thei were speak of common acquaint keep up the most trivial
convers but to kitti it seem that everi word thei said wa
determin their fate and her and strang it wa that thei were
actual talk of how absurd ivan ivanovitch wa with hi french and
how the eletski girl might have made a better match yet these word
had all the while consequ for them and thei were feel just as
kitti did the whole ball the whole world everyth seem lost in
fog in kitti soul noth but the stern disciplin of her
bringingup support her and forc her to do what wa expect of
her that is to danc to answer question to talk even to smile
but befor the mazurka when thei were begin to rearrang the
chair and a few coupl move out of the smaller room into the big
room a moment of despair and horror came for kitti she had refus
five partner and now she wa not danc the mazurka she had not
even a hope of be ask for it becaus she wa so success in
societi that the idea would never occur to anyon that she had remain
disengag till now she would have to tell her mother she felt ill and
go home but she had not the strength to do thi she felt crush she
went to the furthest end of the littl drawingroom and sank into a low
chair her light transpar skirt rose like a cloud about her
slender waist on bare thin soft girlish arm hang listlessli
wa lost in the fold of her pink tunic in the other she held her fan
and with rapid short stroke fan her burn face but while she
look like a butterfli cling to a blade of grass and just about
to open it rainbow wing for fresh flight her heart ach with a
horribl despair
but perhap i am wrong perhap it wa not so and again she recal
all she had seen

no on but she herself understood her posit no on knew that she
had just refus the man whom perhap she love and refus him
becaus she had put her faith in anoth
countess nordston found korsunski with whom she wa to danc the
mazurka and told him to ask kitti
kitti danc in the first coupl and luckili for her she had not to
talk becaus korsunski wa all the time run about direct the
figur vronski and anna sat almost opposit her she saw them with her
longsight ey and saw them too close by when thei met in the
figur and the more she saw of them the more convinc wa she that
her unhappi wa complet she saw that thei felt themselv alon
in that crowd room and on vronski face alwai so firm and
independ she saw that look that had struck her of bewilder and
humbl submiss like the express of an intellig dog when
it ha done wrong
anna smile and her smile wa reflect by him she grew thought
and he becam seriou some supernatur forc drew kitti ey to
anna face she wa fascin in her simpl black dress fascin
were her round arm with their bracelet fascin wa her firm neck
with it thread of pearl fascin the strai curl of her loos
hair fascin the grace light movement of her littl feet and

not want by anyon nor of us to anybodi and he recal hi
brother nikolai and dwelt with pleasur on the thought of him isnt
he right that everyth in the world is base and loathsom and ar we
fair in our judgment of brother nikolai of cours from the point of
view of prokofi see him in a torn cloak and tipsi he a
despic person but i know him differ i know hi soul and
know that we ar like him and i instead of go to seek him out
went out to dinner and came here levin walk up to a lamppost read

abund in comparison with the poverti of the peasant and now he
determin that so as to feel quit in the right though he had work
hard and live by no mean luxuri befor he would now work still

and the measur to be taken to restor her fail strength she had
been ill and as spring came on she grew wors the famili doctor gave
her cod liver oil then iron then nitrat of silver but as the first
and the second and the third were alik in do no good and as hi
advic when spring came wa to go abroad a celebr physician wa
call in the celebr physician a veri handsom man still
youngish ask to examin the patient he maintain with peculiar
satisfact it seem that maiden modesti is a mere relic of
barbar and that noth could be more natur than for a man still
youngish to handl a young girl nake he thought it natur becaus he
did it everi dai and felt and thought as it seem to him no harm as
he did it and consequ he consid modesti in the girl not mere
as a relic of barbar but also as an insult to himself
there wa noth for it but to submit sinc although all the doctor
had studi in the same school had read the same book and learn
the same scienc and though some peopl said thi celebr doctor
wa a bad doctor in the princesss household and circl it wa for
some reason accept that thi celebr doctor alon had some special
knowledg and that he alon could save kitti after a care
examin and sound of the bewild patient daze with shame
the celebr doctor have scrupul wash hi hand wa
stand in the drawingroom talk to the princ the princ frown
and cough listen to the doctor as a man who had seen someth
of life and neither a fool nor an invalid he had no faith in
medicin and in hi heart wa furiou at the whole farc special as
he wa perhap the onli on who fulli comprehend the caus of kitti
ill conceit blockhead he thought as he listen to the
celebr doctor chatter about hi daughter symptom the doctor
wa meantim with difficulti restrain the express of hi contempt
for thi old gentleman and with difficulti condescend to the level
of hi intellig he perceiv that it wa no good talk to the
old man and that the princip person in the hous wa the mother
befor her he decid to scatter hi pearl at that instant the
princess came into the drawingroom with the famili doctor the princ
withdrew try not to show how ridicul he thought the whole
perform the princess wa distract and did not know what to do
she felt she had sin against kitti
well doctor decid our fate said the princess tell me

not utter the question well doctor
immedi princess i will talk it over with my colleagu and then
i will have the honor of lai my opinion befor you
so we had better leav you
as you pleas
the princess went out with a sigh
when the doctor were left alon the famili doctor began timidli
explain hi opinion that there wa a commenc of tubercul
troubl but and so on the celebr doctor listen to him and
in the middl of hi sentenc look at hi big gold watch
ye said he but
the famili doctor respectfulli ceas in the middl of hi
observ
the commenc of the tubercul process we ar not as you ar
awar abl to defin till there ar caviti there is noth
definit but we mai suspect it and there ar indic
malnutrit nervou excit and so on the question stand
thu in presenc of indic of tubercul process what is to be
done to maintain nutrit
but you know there ar alwai moral spiritu caus at the back in
these case the famili doctor permit himself to interpol with a
subtl smile
ye that an understood thing respond the celebr physician
again glanc at hi watch beg pardon is the yauski bridg done
yet or shall i have to drive around he ask ah it is oh well
then i can do it in twenti minut so we were sai the problem mai
be put thu to maintain nutrit and to give tone to the nerv the
on is in close connect with the other on must attack both side
at onc
and how about a tour abroad ask the famili doctor
iv no like for foreign tour and take note if there is an earli
stage of tubercul process of which we cannot be certain a foreign
tour will be of no us what is want is mean of improv nutrit
and not for lower it and the celebr doctor expound hi plan
of treatment with soden water a remedi obvious prescrib primarili
on the ground that thei could do no harm
the famili doctor listen attent and respectfulli
but in favor of foreign travel i would urg the chang of habit the
remov from condit call up reminisc and then the mother
wish it he ad
ah well in that case to be sure let them go onli those german
quack ar mischiev thei ought to be persuad well let

and conclud by insist on the drink of the water which were
certainli harmless at the question should thei go abroad the doctor
plung into deep medit as though resolv a weighti problem
final hi decis wa pronounc thei were to go abroad but to put
no faith in foreign quack and to appli to him in ani need

by mean of which alexei alexandrovitch had made hi career the center
of thi circl wa the countess lidia ivanovna it wa a set made up of
elderli ugli benevol and godli women and clever learn and
ambiti men on of the clever peopl belong to the set had call

chapter 8
alexei alexandrovitch had seen noth strike or improp in the fact
that hi wife wa sit with vronski at a tabl apart in eager
convers with him about someth but he notic that to the rest
of the parti thi appear someth strike and improp and for
that reason it seem to him too to be improp he made up hi mind
that he must speak of it to hi wife
on reach home alexei alexandrovitch went to hi studi as he usual
did seat himself in hi low chair open a book on the papaci at
the place where he had laid the paperknif in it and read till on
oclock just as he usual did but from time to time he rub hi
high forehead and shook hi head as though to drive awai someth at
hi usual time he got up and made hi toilet for the night anna
arkadyevna had not yet come in with a book under hi arm he went
upstair but thi even instead of hi usual thought and
medit upon offici detail hi thought were absorb by hi
wife and someth disagre connect with her contrari to hi
usual habit he did not get into bed but fell to walk up and down
the room with hi hand clasp behind hi back he could not go to
bed feel that it wa absolut need for him first to think
thoroughli over the posit that had just arisen
when alexei alexandrovitch had made up hi mind that he must talk to
hi wife about it it had seem a veri easi and simpl matter but
now when he began to think over the question that had just present
itself it seem to him veri complic and difficult
alexei alexandrovitch wa not jealou jealousi accord to hi
notion wa an insult to on wife and on ought to have confid
in on wife why on ought to have confidencethat is to sai
complet convict that hi young wife would alwai love himh did
not ask himself but he had no experi of lack of confid
becaus he had confid in her and told himself that he ought to
have it now though hi convict that jealousi wa a shame
feel and that on ought to feel confid had not broken down he
felt that he wa stand face to face with someth illog and
irrat and did not know what wa to be done alexei alexandrovitch
wa stand face to face with life with the possibl of hi wife
love someon other than himself and thi seem to him veri
irrat and incomprehens becaus it wa life itself all hi
life alexei alexandrovitch had live and work in offici sphere
have to do with the reflect of life and everi time he had
stumbl against life itself he had shrunk awai from it now he
experienc a feel akin to that of a man who while calmli cross
a precipic by a bridg should suddenli discov that the bridg is
broken and that there is a chasm below that chasm wa life itself
the bridg that artifici life in which alexei alexandrovitch had
live for the first time the question present itself to him of the
possibl of hi wife love someon els and he wa horrifi at
it
he did not undress but walk up and down with hi regular tread over
the resound parquet of the diningroom where on lamp wa burn
over the carpet of the dark drawingroom in which the light wa
reflect on the big new portrait of himself hang over the sofa and
across her boudoir where two candl burn light up the portrait
of her parent and woman friend and the pretti knickknack of her
writingt that he knew so well he walk across her boudoir to
the bedroom door and turn back again at each turn in hi walk
especi at the parquet of the light diningroom he halt and
said to himself ye thi i must decid and put a stop to i must
express my view of it and my decis and he turn back again but
express whatwhat decis he said to himself in the drawingroom
and he found no repli but after all he ask himself befor turn
into the boudoir what ha occur noth she wa talk a long
while with him but what of that sure women in societi can talk to
whom thei pleas and then jealousi mean lower both myself and
her he told himself as he went into her boudoir but thi dictum
which had alwai had such weight with him befor had now no weight and
no mean at all and from the bedroom door he turn back again but
as he enter the dark drawingroom some inner voic told him that it
wa not so and that if other notic it that show that there wa
someth and he said to himself again in the diningroom ye i
must decid and put a stop to it and express my view of it and
again at the turn in the drawingroom he ask himself decid how
and again he ask himself what had occur and answer
noth and recollect that jealousi wa a feel insult to hi
wife but again in the drawingroom he wa convinc that someth had
happen hi thought like hi bodi went round a complet circl
without come upon anyth new he notic thi rub hi forehead
and sat down in her boudoir
there look at her tabl with the malachit blot case ly at
the top and an unfinish letter hi thought suddenli chang he
began to think of her of what she wa think and feel for the
first time he pictur vividli to himself her person life her idea
her desir and the idea that she could and should have a separ
life of her own seem to him so alarm that he made hast to dispel
it it wa the chasm which he wa afraid to peep into to put himself
in thought and feel in anoth person place wa a spiritu
exercis not natur to alexei alexandrovitch he look on thi
spiritu exercis as a harm and danger abus of the fanci
and the worst of it all thought he is that just now at the veri
moment when my great work is approach complet he wa think
of the project he wa bring forward at the time when i stand in
need of all my mental peac and all my energi just now thi stupid
worri should fall foul of me but what to be done im not on of
those men who submit to uneasi and worri without have the forc
of charact to face them
i must think it over come to a decis and put it out of my mind
he said aloud
the question of her feel of what ha pass and mai be pass in
her soul that not my affair that the affair of her conscienc
and fall under the head of religion he said to himself feel
consol in the sens that he had found to which divis of
regul principl thi new circumst could be properli refer
and so alexei alexandrovitch said to himself question as to her
feel and so on ar question for her conscienc with which i can
have noth to do my duti is clearli defin as the head of the
famili i am a person bound in duti to guid her and consequ in
part the person respons i am bound to point out the danger i
perceiv to warn her even to us my author i ought to speak
plainli to her and everyth that he would sai tonight to hi wife
took clear shape in alexei alexandrovitch head think over what he
would sai he somewhat regret that he should have to us hi time
and mental power for domest consumpt with so littl to show for
it but in spite of that the form and content of the speech befor
him shape itself as clearli and distinctli in hi head as a
ministeri report
i must sai and express fulli the follow point first exposit
of the valu to be attach to public opinion and to decorum secondli
exposit of religi signific of marriag thirdli if need be
refer to the calam possibl ensu to our son fourthli
refer to the unhappi like to result to herself and
interlac hi finger alexei alexandrovitch stretch them and the
joint of the finger crack thi trick a bad habit the crack of
hi finger alwai sooth him and gave precis to hi thought so
need to him at thi junctur
there wa the sound of a carriag drive up to the front door alexei
alexandrovitch halt in the middl of the room
a woman step wa heard mount the stair alexei alexandrovitch
readi for hi speech stood compress hi cross finger wait to
see if the crack would not come again on joint crack
alreadi from the sound of light step on the stair he wa awar that
she wa close and though he wa satisfi with hi speech he felt

taken by the young shoot and twig imprison in it swell bud
hardli knew what undertak he wa go to begin upon now in the
farm work that wa so dear to him but he felt that he wa full of the
most splendid plan and project first of all he went to the cattl

were alreadi shine with their new sleek spring coat thei bask
in the sunshin and low to go to the meadow levin gaze admiringli
at the cow he knew so intim to the minutest detail of their

noth mortifi levin so much as that tone but it wa the tone
common to all the bailiff he had ever had thei had all taken up that
attitud to hi plan and so now he wa not anger by it but
mortifi and felt all the more rous to struggl against thi as it

and levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out
into the open countri hi good littl hors after hi long
inact step out gallantli snort over the pool and
ask as it were for guidanc if levin had felt happi befor in the
cattl pen and farmyard he felt happier yet in the open countri
swai rhythmic with the ambl pace of hi good littl cob
drink in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air as he
rode through hi forest over the crumbl wast snow still left in
part and cover with dissolv track he rejoic over everi tree
with the moss reviv on it bark and the bud swell on it shoot
when he came out of the forest in the immens plain befor him hi
grass field stretch in an unbroken carpet of green without on bare
place or swamp onli spot here and there in the hollow with patch
of melt snow he wa not put out of temper even by the sight of the
peasant hors and colt trampl down hi young grass he told a
peasant he met to drive them out nor by the sarcast and stupid
repli of the peasant ipat whom he met on the wai and ask well
ipat shall we soon be sow we must get the plough done first
konstantin dmitrievitch answer ipat the further he rode the
happier he becam and plan for the land rose to hi mind each better
than the last to plant all hi field with hedg along the southern
border so that the snow should not lie under them to divid them up
into six field of arabl and three of pastur and hai to build a
cattl yard at the further end of the estat and to dig a pond and to
construct movabl pen for the cattl as a mean of manur the land
and then eight hundr acr of wheat three hundr of potato and
four hundr of clover and not on acr exhaust
absorb in such dream carefulli keep hi hors by the hedg so
as not to trampl hi young crop he rode up to the labor who had
been sent to sow clover a cart with the seed in it wa stand not

earth that clung to each foot and get off hi hors he took the
siev from vassili and start sow himself
where did you stop
vassili point to the mark with hi foot and levin went forward as
best he could scatter the seed on the land walk wa as
difficult as on a bog and by the time levin had end the row he wa
in a great heat and he stop and gave up the siev to vassili

although all vronski inner life wa absorb in hi passion hi
extern life unalter and inevit follow along the old
accustom line of hi social and regiment ti and interest the
interest of hi regiment took an import place in vronski life
both becaus he wa fond of the regiment and becaus the regiment wa
fond of him thei were not onli fond of vronski in hi regiment thei
respect him too and were proud of him proud that thi man with hi
immens wealth hi brilliant educ and abil and the path
open befor him to everi kind of success distinct and ambit
had disregard all that and of all the interest of life had the
interest of hi regiment and hi comrad nearest to hi heart
vronski wa awar of hi comrad view of him and in addit to hi
like for the life he felt bound to keep up that reput
it need not be said that he did not speak of hi love to ani of hi
comrad nor did he betrai hi secret even in the wildest drink
bout though inde he wa never so drunk as to lose all control of
himself and he shut up ani of hi thoughtless comrad who attempt
to allud to hi connect but in spite of that hi love wa known
to all the town everyon guess with more or less confid at hi
relat with madam karenina the major of the younger men envi
him for just what wa the most irksom factor in hi loveth exalt
posit of karenin and the consequ public of their connect
in societi
the greater number of the young women who envi anna and had long
been weari of hear her call virtuou rejoic at the
fulfil of their predict and were onli wait for a decis
turn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their
scorn thei were alreadi make readi their hand of mud to fling at
her when the right moment arriv the greater number of the
middleag peopl and certain great personag were displeas at the
prospect of the impend scandal in societi
vronski mother on hear of hi connect wa at first pleas at
it becaus noth to her mind gave such a finish touch to a
brilliant young man as a liaison in the highest societi she wa
pleas too that madam karenina who had so taken her fanci and had
talk so much of her son wa after all just like all other pretti
and wellbr womenat least accord to the countess vronskaya
idea but she had heard of late that her son had refus a posit
offer him of great import to hi career simpli in order to
remain in the regiment where he could be constantli see madam
karenina she learn that great personag were displeas with him on
thi account and she chang her opinion she wa vex too that
from all she could learn of thi connect it wa not that brilliant
grace worldli liaison which she would have welcom but a sort
of wertherish desper passion so she wa told which might well
lead him into imprud she had not seen him sinc hi abrupt
departur from moscow and she sent her elder son to bid him come to
see her
thi elder son too wa displeas with hi younger brother he did
not distinguish what sort of love hi might be big or littl
passion or passionless last or pass he kept a ballet girl
himself though he wa the father of a famili so he wa lenient in
these matter but he knew that thi love affair wa view with
displeasur by those whom it wa necessari to pleas and therefor he
did not approv of hi brother conduct

interesthors he wa passion fond of hors

to recruit and rest himself from the violent emot that agit

the red blood in the cartilag within about all her figur and
especi her head there wa a certain express of energi and at
the same time of soft she wa on of those creatur which seem
onli not to speak becaus the mechan of their mouth doe not allow

it wa muddi befor now it will be a perfect swamp as he sat in
solitud in the close carriag he took out hi mother letter and
hi brother note and read them through
ye it wa the same thing over and over again everyon hi mother
hi brother everyon thought fit to interfer in the affair of hi
heart thi interfer arous in him a feel of angri hatreda
feel he had rare known befor what busi is it of their why
doe everybodi feel call upon to concern himself about me and why do
thei worri me so just becaus thei see that thi is someth thei
cant understand if it were a common vulgar worldli intrigu thei
would have left me alon thei feel that thi is someth differ
that thi is not a mere pastim that thi woman is dearer to me than
life and thi is incomprehens and that why it annoi them
whatev our destini is or mai be we have made it ourselv and we do
not complain of it he said in the word we link himself with
anna no thei must need teach us how to live thei havent an idea
of what happi is thei dont know that without our love for us
there is neither happi nor unhappinessno life at all he thought
he wa angri with all of them for their interfer just becaus he
felt in hi soul that thei all these peopl were right he felt that
the love that bound him to anna wa not a momentari impuls which
would pass as worldli intrigu do pass leav no other trace in
the life of either but pleasant or unpleas memori he felt all the
tortur of hi own and her posit all the difficulti there wa for
them conspicu as thei were in the ey of all the world in
conceal their love in ly and deceiv and in ly deceiv
feign and continu think of other when the passion that
unit them wa so intens that thei were both oblivi of everyth
els but their love
he vividli recal all the constantli recur instanc of
inevit necess for ly and deceit which were so against hi
natur bent he recal particularli vividli the shame he had more
than onc detect in her at thi necess for ly and deceit and
he experienc the strang feel that had sometim come upon him
sinc hi secret love for anna thi wa a feel of loath for
somethingwheth for alexei alexandrovitch or for himself or for the
whole world he could not have said but he alwai drove awai thi
strang feel now too he shook it off and continu the thread of
hi thought
ye she wa unhappi befor but proud and at peac and now she
cannot be at peac and feel secur in her digniti though she doe not
show it ye we must put an end to it he decid
and for the first time the idea clearli present itself that it wa
essenti to put an end to thi fals posit and the sooner the
better throw up everyth she and i and hide ourselv somewher
alon with our love he said to himself
chapter 22
the rain did not last long and by the time vronski arriv hi
shafthors trot at full speed and drag the tracehors
gallop through the mud with their rein hang loos the sun had
peep out again the roof of the summer villa and the old limetre
in the garden on both side of the princip street sparkl with wet
brillianc and from the twig came a pleasant drip and from the roof
rush stream of water he thought no more of the shower spoil the
race cours but wa rejoic now thatthank to the rainh would be
sure to find her at home and alon as he knew that alexei
alexandrovitch who had late return from a foreign water place
had not move from petersburg
hope to find her alon vronski alight as he alwai did to avoid
attract attent befor cross the bridg and walk to the
hous he did not go up the step to the street door but went into the
court
ha your master come he ask a garden
no sir the mistress is at home but will you pleas go to the front
door there ar servant there the garden answer theyll open
the door
no ill go in from the garden
and feel satisfi that she wa alon and want to take her by
surpris sinc he had not promis to be there todai and she would
certainli not expect him to come befor the race he walk hold
hi sword and step cautious over the sandi path border with
flower to the terrac that look out upon the garden vronski forgot
now all that he had thought on the wai of the hardship and
difficulti of their posit he thought of noth but that he would
see her directli not in imagin but live all of her as she
wa in realiti he wa just go in step on hi whole foot so as
not to creak up the worn step of the terrac when he suddenli
rememb what he alwai forgot and what caus the most tortur
side of hi relat with her her son with hi questioninghostil
as he fanciedey
thi boi wa more often than anyon els a check upon their freedom
when he wa present both vronski and anna did not mere avoid
speak of anyth that thei could not have repeat befor everyon
thei did not even allow themselv to refer by hint to anyth the
boi did not understand thei had made no agreement about thi it had
settl itself thei would have felt it wound themselv to deceiv
the child in hi presenc thei talk like acquaint but in spite
of thi caution vronski often saw the child intent bewild
glanc fix upon him and a strang shyness uncertainti at on time
friendli at anoth cold and reserv in the boi manner to
him as though the child felt that between thi man and hi mother
there exist some import bond the signific of which he could
not understand
as a fact the boi did feel that he could not understand thi relat
and he tri painfulli and wa not abl to make clear to himself what
feel he ought to have for thi man with a child keen instinct for
everi manifest of feel he saw distinctli that hi father hi
gover hi nurseal did not mere dislik vronski but look on
him with horror and avers though thei never said anyth about
him while hi mother look on him as her greatest friend
what doe it mean who is he how ought i to love him if i dont
know it my fault either im stupid or a naughti boi thought the
child and thi wa what caus hi dubiou inquir sometim
hostil express and the shyness and uncertainti which vronski
found so irksom thi child presenc alwai and infal call up
in vronski that strang feel of inexplic loath which he had
experienc of late thi child presenc call up both in vronski
and in anna a feel akin to the feel of a sailor who see by the
compass that the direct in which he is swiftli move is far from
the right on but that to arrest hi motion is not in hi power that
everi instant is carri him further and further awai and that to
admit to himself hi deviat from the right direct is the same as
admit hi certain ruin
thi child with hi innoc outlook upon life wa the compass that
show them the point to which thei had depart from what thei knew
but did not want to know
thi time seryozha wa not at home and she wa complet alon she
wa sit on the terrac wait for the return of her son who had
gone out for hi walk and been caught in the rain she had sent a
manserv and a maid out to look for him dress in a white gown
deepli embroid she wa sit in a corner of the terrac behind
some flower and did not hear him bend her curli black head she
press her forehead against a cool water pot that stood on the
parapet and both her love hand with the ring he knew so well
clasp the pot the beauti of her whole figur her head her neck
her hand struck vronski everi time as someth new and unexpect
he stood still gaze at her in ecstasi but directli he would have
made a step to come nearer to her she wa awar of hi presenc
push awai the water pot and turn her flush face toward him
what the matter you ar ill he said to her in french go up to

stiff russian plural form so imposs frigid between them and the

irish barricad on of the most difficult obstacl consist of a
mound fenc with brushwood beyond which wa a ditch out of sight for
the hors so that the hors had to clear both obstacl or might be
kill then two more ditch fill with water and on dry on and
the end of the race wa just face the pavilion but the race began
not in the ring but two hundr yard awai from it and in that part
of the cours wa the first obstacl a dammedup stream seven feet in
breadth which the racer could leap or wade through as thei prefer
three time thei were rang readi to start but each time some hors
thrust itself out of line and thei had to begin again the umpir who
wa start them colonel sestrin wa begin to lose hi temper
when at last for the fourth time he shout awai and the racer

everi ey everi operaglass wa turn on the brightli color group
of rider at the moment thei were in line to start
theyr off theyr start wa heard on all side after the hush
of expect
and littl group and solitari figur among the public began run
from place to place to get a better view in the veri first minut the
close group of horsemen drew out and it could be seen that thei were
approach the stream in two and three and on behind anoth to
the spectat it seem as though thei had all start simultan
but to the racer there were second of differ that had great valu
to them
froufrou excit and overnerv had lost the first moment and
sever hors had start befor her but befor reach the stream
vronski who wa hold in the mare with all hi forc as she tug
at the bridl easili overtook three and there were left in front of
him mahotin chestnut gladiat whose hindquart were move
lightli and rhythmic up and down exactli in front of vronski and
in front of all the dainti mare diana bear kuzovlev more dead than
aliv
for the first instant vronski wa not master either of himself or hi
mare up to the first obstacl the stream he could not guid the
motion of hi mare
gladiat and diana came up to it togeth and almost at the same
instant simultan thei rose abov the stream and flew across to
the other side froufrou dart after them as if fly but at the
veri moment when vronski felt himself in the air he suddenli saw
almost under hi mare hoof kuzovlev who wa flounder with diana
on the further side of the stream kuzovlev had let go the rein as he
took the leap and the mare had sent him fly over her head those
detail vronski learn later at the moment all he saw wa that just
under him where froufrou must alight diana leg or head might be
in the wai but froufrou drew up her leg and back in the veri act of
leap like a fall cat and clear the other mare alight
beyond her
o the darl thought vronski
after cross the stream vronski had complet control of hi mare and
began hold her in intend to cross the great barrier behind
mahotin and to try to overtak him in the clear ground of about five
hundr yard that follow it
the great barrier stood just in front of the imperi pavilion the
tsar and the whole court and crowd of peopl were all gaze at
themat him and mahotin a length ahead of him as thei drew near the
devil as the solid barrier wa call vronski wa awar of those
ey fasten upon him from all side but he saw noth except the
ear and neck of hi own mare the ground race to meet him and the
back and white leg of gladiat beat time swiftli befor him and
keep alwai the same distanc ahead gladiat rose with no sound
of knock against anyth with a wave of hi short tail he
disappear from vronski sight
bravo cri a voic
at the same instant under vronski ey right befor him flash the
pale of the barrier without the slightest chang in her action hi
mare flew over it the pale vanish and he heard onli a crash
behind him the mare excit by gladiat keep ahead had risen
too soon befor the barrier and graze it with her hind hoof but her
pace never chang and vronski feel a spatter of mud in hi face
realiz that he wa onc more the same distanc from gladiat onc
more he perceiv in front of him the same back and short tail and
again the same swiftli move white leg that got no further awai
at the veri moment when vronski thought that now wa the time to
overtak mahotin froufrou herself understand hi thought
without ani incit on hi part gain ground consider and
began get alongsid of mahotin on the most favor side close to
the inner cord mahotin would not let her pass that side vronski had
hardli form the thought that he could perhap pass on the outer side
when froufrou shift her pace and began overtak him on the other
side froufrou shoulder begin by now to be dark with sweat wa
even with gladiat back for a few length thei move evenli but
befor the obstacl thei were approach vronski began work at the
rein anxiou to avoid have to take the outer circl and swiftli
pass mahotin just upon the decliv he caught a glimps of hi
mudstain face as he flash by he even fanci that he smile
vronski pass mahotin but he wa immedi awar of him close upon
him and he never ceas hear the eventhud hoof and the rapid
and still quit fresh breath of gladiat
the next two obstacl the water cours and the barrier were easili
cross but vronski began to hear the snort and thud of gladiat
closer upon him he urg on hi mare and to hi delight felt that she
easili quicken her pace and the thud of gladiat hoof wa again
heard at the same distanc awai
vronski wa at the head of the race just as he want to be and as
cord had advis and now he felt sure of be the winner hi
excit hi delight and hi tender for froufrou grew keener
and keener he long to look round again but he did not dare do thi
and tri to be cool and not to urg on hi mare so to keep the same
reserv of forc in her as he felt that gladiat still kept there
remain onli on obstacl the most difficult if he could cross it
ahead of the other he would come in first he wa fly toward the
irish barricad froufrou and he both togeth saw the barricad in
the distanc and both the man and the mare had a moment hesit
he saw the uncertainti in the mare ear and lift the whip but at
the same time felt that hi fear were groundless the mare knew what
wa want she quicken her pace and rose smoothli just as he had
fanci she would and as she left the ground gave herself up to the
forc of her rush which carri her far beyond the ditch and with the
same rhythm without effort with the same leg forward froufrou fell
back into her pace again
bravo vronski he heard shout from a knot of menh knew thei were
hi friend in the regimentwho were stand at the obstacl he could
not fail to recogn yashvin voic though he did not see him
o my sweet he said inwardli to froufrou as he listen for what

felt that the mare wa at her veri last reserv of strength not her
neck and shoulder mere were wet but the sweat wa stand in drop
on her mane her head her sharp ear and her breath came in short
sharp gasp but he knew that she had strength left more than enough
for the remain five hundr yard it wa onli from feel himself
nearer the ground and from the peculiar smooth of hi motion that
vronski knew how greatli the mare had quicken her pace she flew over
the ditch as though not notic it she flew over it like a bird but
at the same instant vronski to hi horror felt that he had fail to
keep up with the mare pace that he had he did not know how made a
fear unpardon mistak in recov hi seat in the saddl
all at onc hi posit had shift and he knew that someth aw
had happen he could not yet make out what had happen when the
white leg of a chestnut hors flash by close to him and mahotin
pass at a swift gallop vronski wa touch the ground with on
foot and hi mare wa sink on that foot he just had time to free
hi leg when she fell on on side gasp painfulli and make vain
effort to rise with her delic soak neck she flutter on the
ground at hi feet like a shot bird the clumsi movement made by
vronski had broken her back but that he onli knew much later at that
moment he knew onli that mahotin had flown swiftli by while he stood

part three
chapter 1
sergei ivanovitch koznishev want a rest from mental work and instead
of go abroad as he usual did he came toward the end of mai to
stai in the countri with hi brother in hi judgment the best sort of
life wa a countri life he had come now to enjoi such a life at hi
brother konstantin levin wa veri glad to have him especi as he
did not expect hi brother nikolai that summer but in spite of hi
affect and respect for sergei ivanovitch konstantin levin wa
uncomfort with hi brother in the countri it made him
uncomfort and it posit annoi him to see hi brother
attitud to the countri to konstantin levin the countri wa the
background of life that is of pleasur endeavor labor to sergei
ivanovitch the countri meant on on hand rest from work on the other a
valuabl antidot to the corrupt influenc of town which he took with
satisfact and a sens of it util to konstantin levin the
countri wa good first becaus it afford a field for labor of the
us of which there could be no doubt to sergei ivanovitch the
countri wa particularli good becaus there it wa possibl and
fit to do noth moreov sergei ivanovitch attitud to the
peasant rather piqu konstantin sergei ivanovitch us to sai that
he knew and like the peasantri and he often talk to the peasant
which he knew how to do without affect or condescens and from
everi such convers he would deduc gener conclus in favor of
the peasantri and in confirm of hi know them konstantin levin
did not like such an attitud to the peasant to konstantin the
peasant wa simpli the chief partner in their common labor and in
spite of all the respect and the love almost like that of kinship he
had for the peasantsuck in probabl as he said himself with the
milk of hi peasant nursestil as a fellowwork with him while
sometim enthusiast over the vigor gentl and justic of these
men he wa veri often when their common labor call for other
qualiti exasper with the peasant for hi careless lack of
method drunken and ly if he had been ask whether he like
or didnt like the peasant konstantin levin would have been
absolut at a loss what to repli he like and did not like the
peasant just as he like and did not like men in gener of cours
be a goodheart man he like men rather than he dislik them
and so too with the peasant but like or dislik the peopl as
someth apart he could not not onli becaus he live with the
peopl and all hi interest were bound up with their but also
becaus he regard himself as a part of the peopl did not see ani
special qualiti or fail distinguish himself and the peopl
and could not contrast himself with them moreov although he had
live so long in the closest relat with the peasant as farmer and
arbitr and what wa more as advis the peasant trust him
and for thirti mile round thei would come to ask hi advic he had
no definit view of the peopl and would have been as much at a
loss to answer the question whether he knew the peopl as the
question whether he like them for him to sai he knew the peasantri
would have been the same as to sai he knew men he wa continu
watch and get to know peopl of all sort and among them
peasant whom he regard as good and interest peopl and he wa
continu observ new point in them alter hi former view of
them and form new on with sergei ivanovitch it wa quit the
contrari just as he like and prais a countri life in comparison
with the life he did not like so too he like the peasantri in
contradistinct to the class of men he did not like and so too he
knew the peasantri as someth distinct from and oppos to men
gener in hi method brain there were distinctli formul
certain aspect of peasant life deduc partli from that life itself
but chiefli from contrast with other mode of life he never chang
hi opinion of the peasantri and hi sympathet attitud toward them
in the discuss that aros between the brother on their view of
the peasantri sergei ivanovitch alwai got the better of hi brother
precis becaus sergei ivanovitch had definit idea about the
peasanthi charact hi qualiti and hi tast konstantin levin
had no definit and unalter idea on the subject and so in their
argument konstantin wa readili convict of contradict himself
in sergei ivanovitch ey hi younger brother wa a capit fellow
with hi heart in the right place as he express it in french but
with a mind which though fairli quick wa too much influenc by the
impress of the moment and consequ fill with contradict
with all the condescens of an elder brother he sometim explain
to him the true import of thing but he deriv littl satisfact
from argu with him becaus he got the better of him too easili
konstantin levin regard hi brother as a man of immens intellect and
cultur as gener in the highest sens of the word and possess of
a special faculti for work for the public good but in the depth of
hi heart the older he becam and the more intim he knew hi
brother the more and more frequent the thought struck him that thi
faculti of work for the public good of which he felt himself
utterli devoid wa possibl not so much a qualiti as a lack of
somethingnot a lack of good honest nobl desir and tast but a
lack of vital forc of what is call heart of that impuls which
drive a man to choos someon out of the innumer path of life
and to care onli for that on the better he knew hi brother the more
he notic that sergei ivanovitch and mani other peopl who work for
the public welfar were not led by an impuls of the heart to care for
the public good but reason from intellectu consider that it
wa a right thing to take interest in public affair and consequ
took interest in them levin wa confirm in thi gener by
observ that hi brother did not take question affect the public
welfar or the question of the immort of the soul a bit more to
heart than he did chess problem or the ingeni construct of a
new machin
besid thi konstantin levin wa not at hi eas with hi brother
becaus in summer in the countri levin wa continu busi with work
on the land and the long summer dai wa not long enough for him to get
through all he had to do while sergei ivanovitch wa take a holidai
but though he wa take a holidai now that is to sai he wa do no
write he wa so us to intellectu activ that he like to put
into concis and eloqu shape the idea that occur to him and
like to have someon to listen to him hi most usual and natur
listen wa hi brother and so in spite of the friendli and
direct of their relat konstantin felt an awkward in
leav him alon sergei ivanovitch like to stretch himself on the
grass in the sun and to lie so bask and chat lazili
you wouldnt believ he would sai to hi brother what a pleasur
thi rural lazi is to me not an idea in on brain as empti as a
drum
but konstantin levin found it dull sit and listen to him
especi when he knew that while he wa awai thei would be cart
dung onto the field not plough readi for it and heap it all up
anyhow and would not screw the share in the plough but would let
them come off and then sai that the new plough were a silli invent
and there wa noth like the old andreevna plough and so on
come youv done enough trudg about in the heat sergei
ivanovitch would sai to him
no i must just run round to the countinghous for a minut levin
would answer and he would run off to the field
chapter 2
earli in june it happen that agafea mihalovna the old nurs and
housekeep in carri to the cellar a jar of mushroom she had just
pickl slip fell and sprain her wrist the district doctor a
talk young medic student who had just finish hi studi

by the young doctor and wa soon in that eager frame of mind hi
brother knew so well which alwai with him follow a brilliant and
eager convers after the departur of the doctor he want to go
with a fish rod to the river sergei ivanovitch wa fond of angl
and wa it seem proud of be abl to care for such a stupid
occup
konstantin levin whose presenc wa need in the plough land and
meadow had come to take hi brother in the trap
it wa that time of the year the turningpoint of summer when the
crop of the present year ar a certainti when on begin to think of
the sow for next year and the mow is at hand when the rye is
all in ear though it ear ar still light not yet full and it wave
in graygreen billow in the wind when the green oat with tuft of
yellow grass scatter here and there among it droop irregularli over
the latesown field when the earli buckwheat is alreadi out and
hide the ground when the fallow land trodden hard as stone by the
cattl ar half plough over with path left untouch by the
plough when from the dry dungheap cart onto the field there come
at sunset a smell of manur mix with meadowsweet and on the
lowli land the riversid meadow ar a thick sea of grass wait
for the mow with blacken heap of the stalk of sorrel among it
it wa the time when there come a brief paus in the toil of the
field befor the begin of the labor of harvesteveri year
recur everi year strain everi nerv of the peasant the crop
wa a splendid on and bright hot summer dai had set in with short
dewi night
the brother had to drive through the wood to reach the meadow
sergei ivanovitch wa all the while admir the beauti of the wood
which were a tangl mass of leav point out to hi brother now an
old lime tree on the point of flower dark on the shadi side and
brightli spot with yellow stipul now the young shoot of thi
year sapl brilliant with emerald konstantin levin did not like
talk and hear about the beauti of natur word for him took awai
the beauti of what he saw he assent to what hi brother said but he
could not help begin to think of other thing when thei came out
of the wood all hi attent wa engross by the view of the fallow
land on the upland in part yellow with grass in part trampl and
checker with furrow in part dot with ridg of dung and in
part even plough a string of cart wa move across it levin
count the cart and wa pleas that all that were want had been
brought and at the sight of the meadow hi thought pass to the
mow he alwai felt someth special move him to the quick at the
haymak on reach the meadow levin stop the hors
the morn dew wa still ly on the thick undergrowth of the grass
and that he might not get hi feet wet sergei ivanovitch ask hi
brother to drive him in the trap up to the willow tree from which the
carp wa caught sorri as konstantin levin wa to crush down hi mow
grass he drove him into the meadow the high grass softli turn about
the wheel and the hors leg leav it seed cling to the wet
axl and spoke of the wheel hi brother seat himself under a
bush arrang hi tackl while levin led the hors awai fasten
him up and walk into the vast graygreen sea of grass unstir by
the wind the silki grass with it ripe seed came almost to hi waist
in the dampest spot
cross the meadow konstantin levin came out onto the road and met
an old man with a swollen ey carri a skep on hi shoulder
what taken a strai swarm fomitch he ask
no inde konstantin dmitrich all we can do to keep our own thi
is the second swarm that ha flown awai luckili the lad caught
them thei were plough your field thei unyok the hors and
gallop after them
well what do you sai fomitchstart mow or wait a bit
eh well our wai to wait till st peter dai but you alwai mow
sooner well to be sure pleas god the hai good therel be
plenti for the beast
what do you think about the weather
that in god hand mayb it will be fine
levin went up to hi brother
sergei ivanovitch had caught noth but he wa not bore and seem
in the most cheer frame of mind levin saw that stimul by hi
convers with the doctor he want to talk levin on the other
hand would have like to get home as soon as possibl to give order
about get togeth the mower for next dai and to set at rest hi
doubt about the mow which greatli absorb him
well let be go he said
why be in such a hurri let stai a littl but how wet you ar even
though on catch noth it nice that the best thing about
everi part of sport that on ha to do with natur how exquisit thi
steeli water is said sergei ivanovitch these riversid bank alwai
remind me of the riddledo you know it the grass sai to the water
we quiver and we quiver
i dont know the riddl answer levin wearili
chapter 3
do you know iv been think about you said sergei ivanovitch
it beyond everyth what be done in the district accord to
what thi doctor tell me he a veri intellig fellow and as iv
told you befor i tell you again it not right for you not to go to
the meet and altogeth to keep out of the district busi if
decent peopl wont go into it of cours it bound to go all wrong
we pai the monei and it all goe in salari and there ar no
school nor district nurs nor midwiv nor drugstoresnoth
well i did try you know levin said slowli and unwillingli i
cant and so there no help for it
but why cant you i must own i cant make it out indiffer
incapacityi wont admit sure it not simpli lazi
none of those thing iv tri and i see i can do noth said
levin
he had hardli grasp what hi brother wa sai look toward the
plough land across the river he made out someth black but he could
not distinguish whether it wa a hors or the bailiff on horseback
why is it you can do noth you made an attempt and didnt succe
as you think and you give in how can you have so littl
selfrespect
selfrespect said levin stung to the quick by hi brother word
i dont understand if theyd told me at colleg that other peopl
understood the integr calculu and i didnt then pride would have
come in but in thi case on want first to be convinc that on ha
certain qualif for thi sort of busi and especi that
all thi busi is of great import
what do you mean to sai it not of import said sergei
ivanovitch stung to the quick too at hi brother consid
anyth of no import that interest him and still more at hi
obvious pai littl attent to what he wa sai
i dont think it import it doe not take hold of me i cant help
it answer levin make out that what he saw wa the bailiff and
that the bailiff seem to be let the peasant go off the plough
land thei were turn the plough over can thei have finish
plough he wonder
come realli though said the elder brother with a frown on hi
handsom clever face there a limit to everyth it veri well
to be origin and genuin and to dislik everyth conventionali
know all about that but realli what your sai either ha no
mean or it ha a veri wrong mean how can you think it a matter
of no import whether the peasant whom you love as you assert
i never did assert it thought konstantin levin
di without help the ignor peasantwomen starv the children
and the peopl stagnat in dark and ar helpless in the hand of
everi villag clerk while you have at your dispos a mean of help
them and dont help them becaus to your mind it of no import
and sergei ivanovitch put befor him the altern either you ar so
undevelop that you cant see all that you can do or you wont
sacrific your eas your vaniti or whatev it is to do it
konstantin levin felt that there wa no cours open to him but to
submit or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good and thi
mortifi him and hurt hi feel
it both he said resolut i dont see that it wa possibl
what wa it imposs if the monei were properli laid out to
provid medic aid
imposs as it seem to me for the three thousand squar mile
of our district what with our thaw and the storm and the work in
the field i dont see how it is possibl to provid medic aid all
over and besid i dont believ in medicin
oh well that unfair i can quot to you thousand of
instanc but the school anywai
why have school
what do you mean can there be two opinion of the advantag of
educ if it a good thing for you it a good thing for
everyon
konstantin levin felt himself moral pin against a wall and so he
got hot and unconsci blurt out the chief caus of hi
indiffer to public busi
perhap it mai all be veri good but why should i worri myself about
establish dispensari which i shall never make us of and school
to which i shall never send my children to which even the peasant
dont want to send their children and to which iv no veri firm faith
that thei ought to send them said he
sergei ivanovitch wa for a minut surpris at thi unexpect view of
the subject but he promptli made a new plan of attack he wa silent
for a littl drew out a hook threw it in again and turn to hi
brother smile
come now in the first place the dispensari is need we
ourselv sent for the district doctor for agafea mihalovna
oh well but i fanci her wrist will never be straight again
that remain to be prove next the peasant who can read and write
is as a workman of more us and valu to you
no you can ask anyon you like konstantin levin answer with
decis the man that can read and write is much inferior as a
workman and mend the highroad is an imposs and as soon as
thei put up bridg theyr stolen
still that not the point said sergei ivanovitch frown he
dislik contradict and still more argument that were continu
skip from on thing to anoth introduc new and disconnect
point so that there wa no know to which to repli do you admit
that educ is a benefit for the peopl
ye i admit it said levin without think and he wa consciou
immedi that he had said what he did not think he felt that if he
admit that it would be prove that he had been talk meaningless
rubbish how it would be prove he could not tell but he knew that
thi would inevit be logic prove to him and he await the
proof
the argument turn out to be far simpler than he had expect
if you admit that it is a benefit said sergei ivanovitch then as
an honest man you cannot help care about it and sympath with
the movement and so wish to work for it
but i still do not admit thi movement to be just said konstantin
levin redden a littl
what but you said just now
that to sai i dont admit it be either good or possibl
that you cant tell without make the trial
well suppos that so said levin though he did not suppos so
at all suppos that is so still i dont see all the same what
im to worri myself about it for
how so
no sinc we ar talk explain it to me from the philosoph
point of view said levin
i cant see where philosophi come in said sergei ivanovitch in a
tone levin fanci as though he did not admit hi brother right to
talk about philosophi and that irrit levin
ill tell you then he said with heat i imagin the mainspr of
all our action is after all selfinterest now in the local
institut i as a nobleman see noth that could conduc to my
prosper and the road ar not better and could not be better my
hors carri me well enough over bad on doctor and dispensari ar
no us to me an arbitr of disput is no us to me i never appeal
to him and never shall appeal to him the school ar no good to me
but posit harm as i told you for me the district institut
simpli mean the liabil to pai fourpenc halfpenni for everi three
acr to drive into the town sleep with bug and listen to all sort
of idioci and loathsom and selfinterest offer me no
induc
excus me sergei ivanovitch interpos with a smile selfinterest
did not induc us to work for the emancip of the serf but we did
work for it
no konstantin levin broke in with still greater heat the
emancip of the serf wa a differ matter there selfinterest
did come in on long to throw off that yoke that crush us all
decent peopl among us but to be a town councilor and discuss how mani
dustmen ar need and how chimnei shall be construct in the town
in which i dont liveto serv on a juri and try a peasant who stolen
a flitch of bacon and listen for six hour at a stretch to all sort
of jabber from the counsel for the defens and the prosecut and the
presid crossexamin my old halfwit alioshka do you admit
prison in the dock the fact of the remov of the bacon eh
konstantin levin had warm to hi subject and began mimick the
presid and the halfwit alioshka it seem to him that it wa
all to the point
but sergei ivanovitch shrug hi shoulder
well what do you mean to sai then
i simpli mean to sai that those right that touch me my interest
i shall alwai defend to the best of my abil that when thei made
raid on us student and the polic read our letter i wa readi to
defend those right to the utmost to defend my right to educ and
freedom i can understand compulsori militari servic which affect my
children my brother and myself i am readi to deliber on what
concern me but deliber on how to spend forti thousand roubl of
district council monei or judg the halfwit alioshkai dont
understand and i cant do it
konstantin levin spoke as though the floodgat of hi speech had burst
open sergei ivanovitch smile
but tomorrow itll be your turn to be tri would it have suit your
tast better to be tri in the old crimin tribun
im not go to be tri i shant murder anybodi and iv no need
of it well i tell you what he went on fly off again to a
subject quit besid the point our district selfgovern and all
the rest of itit just like the birch branch we stick in the ground
on triniti dai for instanc to look like a cops which ha grown up
of itself in europ and i cant gush over these birch branch and
believ in them
sergei ivanovitch mere shrug hi shoulder as though to express
hi wonder how the birch branch had come into their argument at that
point though he did realli understand at onc what hi brother meant
excus me but you know on realli cant argu in that wai he
observ
but konstantin levin want to justifi himself for the fail of
which he wa consciou of lack of zeal for the public welfar and he
went on
i imagin he said that no sort of activ is like to be last
if it is not found on selfinterest that a univers principl a
philosoph principl he said repeat the word philosoph
with determin as though wish to show that he had as much right
as anyon els to talk of philosophi
sergei ivanovitch smile he too ha a philosophi of hi own at the
servic of hi natur tendenc he thought
come youd better let philosophi alon he said the chief problem
of the philosophi of all ag consist just in find the
indispens connect which exist between individu and social
interest but that not to the point what is to the point is a
correct i must make in your comparison the birch ar not simpli
stuck in but some ar sown and some ar plant and on must deal
carefulli with them it onli those peopl that have an intuit
sens of what of import and signific in their institut
and know how to valu them that have a futur befor themit onli
those peopl that on can truli call histor
and sergei ivanovitch carri the subject into the region of
philosoph histori where konstantin levin could not follow him and
show him all the incorrect of hi view
as for your dislik of it excus my sai so that simpli our
russian sloth and old serfown wai and im convinc that in you
it a temporari error and will pass
konstantin wa silent he felt himself vanquish on all side but he
felt at the same time that what he want to sai wa unintellig to
hi brother onli he could not make up hi mind whether it wa
unintellig becaus he wa not capabl of express hi mean
clearli or becaus hi brother would not or could not understand him
but he did not pursu the specul and without repli he fell to
muse on a quit differ and person matter
sergei ivanovitch wound up the last line unti the hors and thei
drove off
chapter 4
the person matter that absorb levin dure hi convers with
hi brother wa thi onc in a previou year he had gone to look at
the mow and be made veri angri by the bailiff he had recours to
hi favorit mean for regain hi temperh took a scyth from a
peasant and began mow
he like the work so much that he had sever time tri hi hand at
mow sinc he had cut the whole of the meadow in front of hi hous
and thi year ever sinc the earli spring he had cherish a plan for
mow for whole dai togeth with the peasant ever sinc hi
brother arriv he had been in doubt whether to mow or not he wa
loath to leav hi brother alon all dai long and he wa afraid hi
brother would laugh at him about it but as he drove into the meadow
and recal the sensat of mow he came near decid that he
would go mow after the irrit discuss with hi brother he
ponder over thi intent again
i must have physic exercis or my temperl certainli be ruin
he thought and he determin he would go mow howev awkward he
might feel about it with hi brother or the peasant
toward even konstantin levin went to hi count hous gave
direct as to the work to be done and sent about the villag to
summon the mower for the morrow to cut the hai in kalinov meadow the
largest and best of hi grass land
and send my scyth pleas to tit for him to set it and bring it
round tomorrow i shall mayb do some mow myself too he said
try not to be embarrass
the bailiff smile and said ye sir
at tea the same even levin said to hi brother
i fanci the fine weather will last tomorrow i shall start mow
im so fond of that form of field labor said sergei ivanovitch
im awfulli fond of it i sometim mow myself with the peasant and
tomorrow i want to try mow the whole dai
sergei ivanovitch lift hi head and look with interest at hi
brother
how do you mean just like on of the peasant all dai long
ye it veri pleasant said levin
it splendid as exercis onli youll hardli be abl to stand it
said sergei ivanovitch without a shade of ironi
iv tri it it hard work at first but you get into it i dare
sai i shall manag to keep it up
realli what an idea but tell me how do the peasant look at it i
suppos thei laugh in their sleev at their master be such a
queer fish
no i dont think so but it so delight and at the same time
such hard work that on ha no time to think about it
but how will you do about dine with them to send you a bottl of
lafitt and roast turkei out there would be a littl awkward
no ill simpli come home at the time of their noondai rest
next morn konstantin levin got up earlier than usual but he wa
detain give direct on the farm and when he reach the mow
grass the mower were alreadi at their second row
from the upland he could get a view of the shade cut part of the
meadow below with it grayish ridg of cut grass and the black heap
of coat taken off by the mower at the place from which thei had
start cut
gradual as he rode toward the meadow the peasant came into sight
some in coat some in their shirt mow on behind anoth in a
long string swing their scyth differ he count fortytwo
of them
thei were mow slowli over the uneven lowli part of the meadow
where there had been an old dam levin recogn some of hi own men
here wa old yermil in a veri long white smock bend forward to
swing a scyth there wa a young fellow vaska who had been a
coachman of levin take everi row with a wide sweep here too wa
tit levin preceptor in the art of mow a thin littl peasant he
wa in front of all and cut hi wide row without bend as though
plai with the scyth
levin got off hi mare and fasten her up by the roadsid went to
meet tit who took a second scyth out of a bush and gave it to him
it readi sir it like a razor cut of itself said tit take
off hi cap with a smile and give him the scyth
levin took the scyth and began try it as thei finish their
row the mower hot and goodhumor came out into the road on
after anoth and laugh a littl greet the master thei all
stare at him but no on made ani remark till a tall old man with a
wrinkl beardless face wear a short sheepskin jacket came out
into the road and accost him
looke now master onc take hold of the rope there no let it
go he said and levin heard smother laughter among the mower
ill try not to let it go he said take hi stand behind tit and
wait for the time to begin
minde repeat the old man
tit made room and levin start behind him the grass wa short close
to the road and levin who had not done ani mow for a long while
and wa disconcert by the ey fasten upon him cut badli for the
first moment though he swung hi scyth vigor behind him he
heard voic
it not set right handl too high see how he ha to stoop to it
said on
press more on the heel said anoth
never mind hell get on all right the old man resum
he made a start you swing it too wide youll tire yourself
out the master sure doe hi best for himself but see the grass
miss out for such work us fellow would catch it
the grass becam softer and levin listen without answer
follow tit try to do the best he could thei move a hundr
pace tit kept move on without stop not show the slightest
weari but levin wa alreadi begin to be afraid he would not be
abl to keep it up he wa so tire
he felt as he swung hi scyth that he wa at the veri end of hi
strength and wa make up hi mind to ask tit to stop but at that
veri moment tit stop of hi own accord and stoop down pick up
some grass rub hi scyth and began whet it levin
straighten himself and draw a deep breath look round behind
him came a peasant and he too wa evid tire for he stop at
onc without wait to mow up to levin and began whet hi scyth
tit sharpen hi scyth and levin and thei went on the next time
it wa just the same tit move on with sweep after sweep of hi
scyth not stop nor show sign of weari levin follow
him try not to get left behind and he found it harder and harder
the moment came when he felt he had no strength left but at that veri
moment tit stop and whet the scyth
so thei mow the first row and thi long row seem particularli hard
work to levin but when the end wa reach and tit shoulder hi
scyth began with deliber stride return on the track left by
hi heel in the cut grass and levin walk back in the same wai over
the space he had cut in spite of the sweat that ran in stream over
hi face and fell in drop down hi nose and drench hi back as
though he had been soak in water he felt veri happi what delight
him particularli wa that now he knew he would be abl to hold out
hi pleasur wa onli disturb by hi row not be well cut i will
swing less with my arm and more with my whole bodi he thought
compar tit row which look as if it had been cut with a line
with hi own unevenli and irregularli ly grass
the first row as levin notic tit had mow special quickli
probabl wish to put hi master to the test and the row happen to
be a long on the next row were easier but still levin had to strain
everi nerv not to drop behind the peasant
he thought of noth wish for noth but not to be left behind
the peasant and to do hi work as well as possibl he heard noth
but the swish of scyth and saw befor him tit upright figur
mow awai the crescentshap curv of the cut grass the grass and
flower head slowli and rhythmic fall befor the blade of hi
scyth and ahead of him the end of the row where would come the rest
suddenli in the midst of hi toil without understand what it wa
or whenc it came he felt a pleasant sensat of chill on hi hot
moist shoulder he glanc at the sky in the interv for whet the
scyth a heavi lower storm cloud had blown up and big raindrop
were fall some of the peasant went to their coat and put them on
othersjust like levin himselfmer shrug their shoulder
enjoi the pleasant cool of it
anoth row and yet anoth row followedlong row and short row
with good grass and with poor grass levin lost all sens of time and
could not have told whether it wa late or earli now a chang began to
come over hi work which gave him immens satisfact in the midst
of hi toil there were moment dure which he forgot what he wa
do and it came all easi to him and at those same moment hi row
wa almost as smooth and well cut as tit but so soon as he
recollect what he wa do and began try to do better he wa at
onc consciou of all the difficulti of hi task and the row wa badli
mown
on finish yet anoth row he would have gone back to the top of the
meadow again to begin the next but tit stop and go up to the
old man said someth in a low voic to him thei both look at the
sun what ar thei talk about and why doesnt he go back thought
levin not guess that the peasant had been mow no less than four
hour without stop and it wa time for their lunch
lunch sir said the old man
is it realli time that right lunch then
levin gave hi scyth to tit and togeth with the peasant who were
cross the long stretch of mown grass slightli sprinkl with rain
to get their bread from the heap of coat he went toward hi hous
onli then he suddenli awok to the fact that he had been wrong about
the weather and the rain wa drench hi hai
the hai will be spoil he said
not a bit of it sir mow in the rain and youll rake in fine
weather said the old man
levin unti hi hors and rode home to hi coffe sergei ivanovitch
wa onli just get up when he had drunk hi coffe levin rode back
again to the mow befor sergei ivanovitch had had time to dress and
come down to the diningroom
chapter 5
after lunch levin wa not in the same place in the string of mower as
befor but stood between the old man who had accost him jocos
and now invit him to be hi neighbor and a young peasant who had
onli been marri in the autumn and who wa mow thi summer for the
first time
the old man hold himself erect move in front with hi feet
turn out take long regular stride and with a precis and
regular action which seem to cost him no more effort than swing
on arm in walk as though it were in plai he laid down the
high even row of grass it wa as though it were not he but the sharp
scyth of itself swish through the juici grass
behind levin came the lad mishka hi pretti boyish face with a twist
of fresh grass bound round hi hair wa all work with effort but
whenev anyon look at him he smile he would clearli have di
sooner than own it wa hard work for him
levin kept between them in the veri heat of the dai the mow did not
seem such hard work to him the perspir with which he wa drench
cool him while the sun that burn hi back hi head and hi
arm bare to the elbow gave a vigor and dog energi to hi labor
and more and more often now came those moment of unconsci when
it wa possibl not to think what on wa do the scyth cut of
itself these were happi moment still more delight were the
moment when thei reach the stream where the row end and the old
man rub hi scyth with the wet thick grass rins it blade in
the fresh water of the stream ladl out a littl in a tin dipper and
offer levin a drink
what do you sai to my homebrew eh good eh said he wink
and truli levin had never drunk ani liquor so good as thi warm water
with green bit float in it and a tast of rust from the tin
dipper and immedi after thi came the delici slow saunter
with hi hand on the scyth dure which he could wipe awai the
stream sweat take deep breath of air and look about at the long
string of mower and at what wa happen around in the forest and the
countri
the longer levin mow the often he felt the moment of
unconsci in which it seem not hi hand that swung the scyth
but the scyth mow of itself a bodi full of life and conscious
of it own and as though by magic without think of it the work
turn out regular and wellfinish of itself these were the most
bliss moment
it wa onli hard work when he had to break off the motion which had
becom unconsci and to think when he had to mow round a hillock or
a tuft of sorrel the old man did thi easili when a hillock came he
chang hi action and at on time with the heel and at anoth with
the tip of hi scyth clip the hillock round both side with short
stroke and while he did thi he kept look about and watch what
came into hi view at on moment he pick a wild berri and at it or
offer it to levin then he flung awai a twig with the blade of the
scyth then he look at a quail nest from which the bird flew just
under the scyth or caught a snake that cross hi path and lift
it on the scyth as though on a fork show it to levin and threw it
awai
for both levin and the young peasant behind him such chang of
posit were difficult both of them repeat over and over again
the same strain movement were in a perfect frenzi of toil and were
incap of shift their posit and at the same time watch what
wa befor them
levin did not notic how time wa pass if he had been ask how
long he had been work he would have said half an hourand it wa
get on for dinner time as thei were walk back over the cut
grass the old man call levin attent to the littl girl and
boi who were come from differ direct hardli visibl through
the long grass and along the road toward the mower carri sack
of bread drag at their littl hand and pitcher of the sour
ryebeer with cloth wrap round them
looke the littl emmet crawl he said point to them and
he shade hi ey with hi hand to look at the sun thei mow two
more row the old man stop
come master dinner time he said briskli and on reach the
stream the mower move off across the line of cut grass toward their
pile of coat where the children who had brought their dinner were
sit wait for them the peasant gather into groupsthos
further awai under a cart those nearer under a willow bush
levin sat down by them he felt disinclin to go awai
all constraint with the master had disappear long ago the peasant
got readi for dinner some wash the young lad bath in the stream
other made a place comfort for a rest unti their sack of
bread and uncov the pitcher of ryebeer the old man crumbl up
some bread in a cup stir it with the handl of a spoon pour
water on it from the dipper broke up some more bread and have
season it with salt he turn to the east to sai hi prayer
come master tast my sop said he kneel down befor the cup
the sop wa so good that levin gave up the idea of go home he dine
with the old man and talk to him about hi famili affair take
the keenest interest in them and told him about hi own affair and
all the circumst that could be of interest to the old man he felt
much nearer to him than to hi brother and could not help smile at
the affect he felt for thi man when the old man got up again said
hi prayer and lai down under a bush put some grass under hi
head for a pillow levin did the same and in spite of the cling
fli that were so persist in the sunshin and the midg that
tickl hi hot face and bodi he fell asleep at onc and onli wake
when the sun had pass to the other side of the bush and reach him
the old man had been awak a long while and wa sit up whet
the scyth of the younger lad
levin look about him and hardli recogn the place everyth wa
so chang the immens stretch of meadow had been mown and wa
sparkl with a peculiar fresh brillianc with it line of alreadi
sweetsmel grass in the slant rai of the even sun and the
bush about the river had been cut down and the river itself not
visibl befor now gleam like steel in it bend and the move
ascend peasant and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of
the meadow and the hawk hover over the strip meadowal wa
perfectli new rais himself levin began consid how much had
been cut and how much more could still be done that dai
the work done wa exception much for fortytwo men thei had cut
the whole of the big meadow which had in the year of serf labor
taken thirti scyth two dai to mow onli the corner remain to do
where the row were short but levin felt a long to get as much
mow done that dai as possibl and wa vex with the sun sink so
quickli in the sky he felt no weari all he want wa to get hi
work done more and more quickli and as much done as possibl
could you cut mashkin upland toowhat do you think he said to the
old man

featheri spot here and there among the tree with wild
heartseas

man who had put on hi short sheepskin jacket wa just as
goodhumor jocos and free in hi movement among the tree thei

big plait shoe with firm littl step he climb slowli up the
steep place and though hi breech hang out below hi smock and
hi whole frame trembl with effort he did not miss on blade of
grass or on mushroom on hi wai and kept make joke with the
peasant and levin levin walk after him and often thought he must

peac with six children darya alexandrovna could not be on would
fall ill anoth might easili becom so a third would be without
someth necessari a fourth would show symptom of a bad disposit
and so on rare inde were the brief period of peac but these care
and anxieti were for darya alexandrovna the sole happi possibl
had it not been for them she would have been left alon to brood over
her husband who did not love her and besid hard though it wa for
the mother to bear the dread of ill the ill themselv and
the grief of see sign of evil propens in her childrenth

everi possibl effort to persuad herself that she wa mistaken that
she as a mother wa partial to her children all the same she could
not help sai to herself that she had charm children all six of

littl about the dogma of the church but in her famili she wa strict
in carri out all that wa requir by the churchand not mere in

look but now she began to feel pleasur and interest in dress again
now she did not dress for her own sake not for the sake of her own
beauti but simpli that as the mother of those exquisit creatur she
might not spoil the gener effect and look at herself for the last
time in the lookingglass she wa satisfi with herself she look
nice not nice as she would have wish to look nice in old dai at a
ball but nice for the object which she now had in view
in the church there wa no on but the peasant the servant and their
womenfolk but darya alexandrovna saw or fanci she saw the

clap levin felt enviou of thi health and mirth he long
to take part in the express of thi joi of life but he could do
noth and had to lie and look on and listen when the peasant with
their sing had vanish out of sight and hear a weari feel
of despond at hi own isol hi physic inact hi
alien from thi world came over levin
some of the veri peasant who had been most activ in wrangl with
him over the hai some whom he had treat with contum and who had
tri to cheat him those veri peasant had greet him goodhumoredli
and evid had not were incap of have ani feel of rancor
against him ani regret ani recollect even of have tri to
deceiv him all that wa drown in a sea of merri common labor god
gave the dai god gave the strength and the dai and the strength were
consecr to labor and that labor wa it own reward for whom the
labor what would be it fruit these were idl considerationsbesid
the point
often levin had admir thi life often he had a sens of envi of the
men who led thi life but todai for the first time especi under
the influenc of what he had seen in the attitud of ivan parmenov to
hi young wife the idea present itself definit to hi mind that
it wa in hi power to exchang the dreari artifici idl and
individualist life he wa lead for thi labori pure and
social delight life
the old man who had been sit besid him had long ago gone home the
peopl had all separ those who live near had gone home while
those who came from far were gather into a group for supper and to
spend the night in the meadow levin unobserv by the peasant still
lai on the haycock and still look on and listen and muse the
peasant who remain for the night in the meadow scarc slept all
the short summer night at first there wa the sound of merri talk and
laugh all togeth over the supper then sing again and laughter
all the long dai of toil had left no trace in them but light of
heart befor the earli dawn all wa hush noth wa to be heard
but the night sound of the frog that never ceas in the marsh and
the hors snort in the mist that rose over the meadow befor the
morn rous himself levin got up from the haycock and look at
the star he saw that the night wa over
well what am i go to do how am i to set about it he said to
himself try to express to himself all the thought and feel he
had pass through in that brief night all the thought and feel
he had pass through fell into three separ train of thought on
wa the renunci of hi old life of hi utterli useless educ
thi renunci gave him satisfact and wa easi and simpl
anoth seri of thought and mental imag relat to the life he
long to live now the simplic the puriti the saniti of thi life
he felt clearli and he wa convinc he would find in it the content
the peac and the digniti of the lack of which he wa so miser
consciou but a third seri of idea turn upon the question how to
effect thi transit from the old life to the new and there noth
took clear shape for him have a wife have work and the necess of
work leav pokrovsko bui land becom a member of a peasant
commun marri a peasant girl how am i to set about it he ask
himself again and could not find an answer i havent slept all
night though and i cant think it out clearli he said to himself
ill work it out later on thing certain thi night ha decid my
fate all my old dream of home life were absurd not the real thing
he told himself it all ever so much simpler and better
how beauti he thought look at the strang as it were
motherofpearl shell of white fleeci cloudlet rest right over hi
head in the middl of the sky how exquisit it all is in thi
exquisit night and when wa there time for that cloudshel to form
just now i look at the sky and there wa noth in itonli two
white streak ye and so impercept too my view of life chang
he went out of the meadow and walk along the highroad toward the
villag a slight wind aros and the sky look grai and sullen the
gloomi moment had come that usual preced the dawn the full triumph
of light over dark
shrink from the cold levin walk rapidli look at the ground
what that someon come he thought catch the tinkl of
bell and lift hi head forti pace from him a carriag with four
hors har abreast wa drive toward him along the grassi road
on which he wa walk the shafthors were tilt against the
shaft by the rut but the dexter driver sit on the box held
the shaft over the rut so that the wheel ran on the smooth part of
the road
thi wa all levin notic and without wonder who it could be he
gaze absent at the coach
in the coach wa an old ladi doze in on corner and at the window
evid onli just awak sat a young girl hold in both hand the
ribbon of a white cap with a face full of light and thought full of
a subtl complex inner life that wa remot from levin she wa
gaze beyond him at the glow of the sunris
at the veri instant when thi apparit wa vanish the truth
ey glanc at him she recogn him and her face light up with
wonder delight
he could not be mistaken there were no other ey like those in the
world there wa onli on creatur in the world that could concentr
for him all the bright and mean of life it wa she it wa
kitti he understood that she wa drive to ergushovo from the railwai
station and everyth that had been stir levin dure that
sleepless night all the resolut he had made all vanish at onc
he recal with horror hi dream of marri a peasant girl there
onli in the carriag that had cross over to the other side of the
road and wa rapidli disappear there onli could he find the
solut of the riddl of hi life which had weigh so agonizingli
upon him of late
she did not look out again the sound of the carriagespr wa no
longer audibl the bell could scarc be heard the bark of dog
show the carriag had reach the villag and all that wa left wa
the empti field all round the villag in front and he himself
isol and apart from it all wander lone along the desert
highroad
he glanc at the sky expect to find there the cloud shell he had
been admir and take as the symbol of the idea and feel of
that night there wa noth in the sky in the least like a shell
there in the remot height abov a mysteri chang had been
accomplish there wa no trace of shell and there wa stretch over
fulli half the sky an even cover of tini and ever tinier cloudlet the
sky had grown blue and bright and with the same soft but with the
same remot it met hi question gaze
no he said to himself howev good that life of simplic and
toil mai be i cannot go back to it i love her
chapter 13
none but those who were most intim with alexei alexandrovitch knew
that while on the surfac the coldest and most reason of men he
had on weak quit oppos to the gener trend of hi charact
alexei alexandrovitch could not hear or see a child or woman cry
without be move the sight of tear threw him into a state of
nervou agit and he utterli lost all power of reflect the
chief secretari of hi depart and hi privat secretari were awar
of thi and us to warn women who came with petit on no account
to give wai to tear if thei did not want to ruin their chanc he
will get angri and will not listen to you thei us to sai and as a
fact in such case the emot disturb set up in alexei
alexandrovitch by the sight of tear found express in hasti anger
i can do noth kindli leav the room he would commonli cry in
such case
when return from the race anna had inform him of her relat
with vronski and immedi afterward had burst into tear hide
her face in her hand alexei alexandrovitch for all the furi arous
in him against her wa awar at the same time of a rush of that
emot disturb alwai produc in him by tear consciou of it
and consciou that ani express of hi feel at that minut would
be out of keep with the posit he tri to suppress everi
manifest of life in himself and so neither stir nor look at
her thi wa what had caus that strang express of deathlik
rigid in hi face which had so impress anna
when thei reach the hous he help her to get out of the carriag
and make an effort to master himself took leav of her with hi
usual urban and utter that phrase that bound him to noth he
said that tomorrow he would let her know hi decis
hi wife word confirm hi worst suspicion had sent a cruel
pang to the heart of alexei alexandrovitch that pang wa intensifi
by the strang feel of physic piti for her set up by her tear
but when he wa all alon in the carriag alexei alexandrovitch to hi
surpris and delight felt complet relief both from thi piti and from
the doubt and agoni of jealousi
he experienc the sensat of a man who ha had a tooth out after
suffer long from toothach after a fear agoni and a sens of
someth huge bigger than the head itself be torn out of hi jaw
the suffer hardli abl to believ in hi own good luck feel all at
onc that what ha so long poison hi exist and enchain hi
attent exist no longer and that he can live and think again and
take interest in other thing besid hi tooth thi feel alexei
alexandrovitch wa experienc the agoni had been strang and
terribl but now it wa over he felt that he could live again and
think of someth other than hi wife
no honor no heart no religion a corrupt woman i alwai knew it and
alwai saw it though i tri to deceiv myself to spare her he said
to himself and it actual seem to him that he alwai had seen it
he recal incid of their past life in which he had never seen
anyth wrong beforenow these incid prove clearli that she had
alwai been a corrupt woman i made a mistak in link my life to
her but there wa noth wrong in my mistak and so i cannot be
unhappi it not i that am to blame he told himself but she but i
have noth to do with her she doe not exist for me
everyth relat to her and her son toward whom hi sentiment
were as much chang as toward her ceas to interest him the onli
thing that interest him now wa the question of in what wai he could
best with most proprieti and comfort for himself and thu with most
justic extric himself from the mud with which she had spatter
him in her fall and then proce along hi path of activ honor
and us exist
i cannot be made unhappi by the fact that a contempt woman ha
commit a crime i have onli to find the best wai out of the
difficult posit in which she ha place me and i shall find it he
said to himself frown more and more im not the first nor the
last and to sai noth of histor instanc date from the fair
helen of menelau recent reviv in the memori of all a whole list
of contemporari exampl of husband with unfaith wive in the
highest societi rose befor alexei alexandrovitch imagin
daryalov poltavski princ karibanov count paskudin dram ye
even dram such an honest capabl fellow semyonov tchagin
sigonin alexei alexandrovitch rememb admit that a certain
quit irrat ridicul fall to the lot of these men yet i never
saw anyth but a misfortun in it and alwai felt sympathi for it
alexei alexandrovitch said to himself though inde thi wa not the
fact and he had never felt sympathi for misfortun of that kind but
the more frequent he had heard of instanc of unfaith wive
betrai their husband the more highli he had thought of himself
it is a misfortun which mai befal anyon and thi misfortun ha
befallen me the onli thing to be done is to make the best of the
posit
and he began pass in review the method of proceed of men who had
been in the same posit that he wa in
daryalov fought a duel
the duel had particularli fascin the thought of alexei
alexandrovitch in hi youth just becaus he wa physic a coward
and wa himself well awar of the fact alexei alexandrovitch could not
without horror contempl the idea of a pistol aim at himself and
had never made us of ani weapon in hi life thi horror had in hi
youth set him ponder on duel and pictur himself in a posit
in which he would have to expos hi life to danger have attain
success and an establish posit in the world he had long ago
forgotten thi feel but the habitu bent of feel reassert
itself and dread of hi own cowardic prove even now so strong that
alexei alexandrovitch spent a long while think over the question of
duel in all it aspect and hug the idea of a duel though he
wa fulli awar beforehand that he would never under ani circumst
fight on
there no doubt our societi is still so barbar it not the same
in england that veri manyand among these were those whose opinion
alexei alexandrovitch particularli valuedlook favor on the duel
but what result is attain by it suppos i call him out alexei
alexandrovitch went on to himself and vividli pictur the night he
would spend after the challeng and the pistol aim at him he
shudder and knew that he never would do itsuppos i call him out
suppos i am taught he went on muse to shoot i press the
trigger he said to himself close hi ey and it turn out i
have kill him alexei alexandrovitch said to himself and he shook
hi head as though to dispel such silli idea what sens is there in
murder a man in order to defin on relat to a guilti wife and
son i should still just as much have to decid what i ought to do with
her but what is more probabl and what would doubtless occuri should
be kill or wound i the innoc person should be the
victimkil or wound it even more senseless but apart from
that a challeng to fight would be an act hardli honest on my side
dont i know perfectli well that my friend would never allow me to
fight a duelwould never allow the life of a statesman need by
russia to be expos to danger know perfectli well beforehand that
the matter would never come to real danger it would amount to my
simpli try to gain a certain sham reput by such a challeng
that would be dishonest that would be fals that would be deceiv
myself and other a duel is quit irrat and no on expect it of
me my aim is simpli to safeguard my reput which is essenti for
the uninterrupt pursuit of my public duti offici duti which
had alwai been of great consequ in alexei alexandrovitch ey
seem of special import to hi mind at thi moment consid
and reject the duel alexei alexandrovitch turn to divorceanoth
solut select by sever of the husband he rememb pass in
mental review all the instanc he knew of divorc there were plenti
of them in the veri highest societi with which he wa veri familiar
alexei alexandrovitch could not find a singl exampl in which the
object of divorc wa that which he had in view in all these instanc
the husband had practic cede or sold hi unfaith wife and the
veri parti which be in fault had not the right to contract a fresh
marriag had form counterfeit pseudomatrimoni ti with a
selfstyl husband in hi own case alexei alexandrovitch saw that a
legal divorc that is to sai on in which onli the guilti wife would
be repudi wa imposs of attain he saw that the complex
condit of the life thei led made the coars proof of hi wife
guilt requir by the law out of the question he saw that a certain
refin in that life would not admit of such proof be brought
forward even if he had them and that to bring forward such proof
would damag him in the public estim more than it would her
an attempt at divorc could lead to noth but a public scandal which
would be a perfect godsend to hi enemi for calumni and attack on
hi high posit in societi hi chief object to defin the posit
with the least amount of disturb possibl would not be attain by
divorc either moreov in the event of divorc or even of an
attempt to obtain a divorc it wa obviou that the wife broke off all
relat with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover and in
spite of the complet as he suppos contempt and indiffer he now
felt for hi wife at the bottom of hi heart alexei alexandrovitch
still had on feel left in regard to hera disinclin to see her
free to throw in her lot with vronski so that her crime would be to
her advantag the mere notion of thi so exasper alexei
alexandrovitch that directli it rose to hi mind he groan with
inward agoni and got up and chang hi place in the carriag and for
a long while after he sat with scowl brow wrap hi numb and
boni leg in the fleeci rug
apart from formal divorc on might still do like karibanov
paskudin and that good fellow dramthat is separ from on wife
he went on think when he had regain hi composur but thi step
too present the same drawback of public scandal as a divorc and
what wa more a separ quit as much as a regular divorc flung
hi wife into the arm of vronski no it out of the question out
of the question he said again twist hi rug about him again i
cannot be unhappi but neither she nor he ought to be happi
the feel of jealousi which had tortur him dure the period of
uncertainti had pass awai at the instant when the tooth had been
with agoni extract by hi wife word but that feel had been
replac by anoth the desir not mere that she should not be
triumphant but that she should get due punish for her crime he
did not acknowledg thi feel but at the bottom of hi heart he
long for her to suffer for have destroi hi peac of mindhi
honor and go onc again over the condit insepar from a
duel a divorc a separ and onc again reject them alexei
alexandrovitch felt convinc that there wa onli on solutionto keep
her with him conceal what had happen from the world and us
everi measur in hi power to break off the intrigu and still
morethough thi he did not admit to himselfto punish her i must
inform her of my conclus that think over the terribl posit
in which she ha place her famili all other solut will be wors
for both side than an extern statu quo and that such i agre to
retain on the strict condit of obedi on her part to my wish
that is to sai cessat of all intercours with her lover when thi
decis had been final adopt anoth weighti consider
occur to alexei alexandrovitch in support of it by such a cours
onli shall i be act in accord with the dictat of religion he
told himself in adopt thi cours i am not cast off a guilti
wife but give her a chanc of amend and inde difficult as
the task will be to me i shall devot part of my energi to her
reform and salvat
though alexei alexandrovitch wa perfectli awar that he could not
exert ani moral influenc over hi wife that such an attempt at
reform could lead to noth but falsiti though in pass
through these difficult moment he had not onc thought of seek
guidanc in religion yet now when hi conclus correspond as it
seem to him with the requir of religion thi religi
sanction to hi decis gave him complet satisfact and to some
extent restor hi peac of mind he wa pleas to think that even
in such an import crisi in life no on would be abl to sai that
he had not act in accord with the principl of that religion
whose banner he had alwai held aloft amid the gener cool and
indiffer as he ponder over subsequ develop alexei
alexandrovitch did not see inde why hi relat with hi wife
should not remain practic the same as befor no doubt she could
never regain hi esteem but there wa not and there could not be ani
sort of reason that hi exist should be troubl and that he
should suffer becaus she wa a bad and faithless wife ye time will
pass time which arrang all thing and the old relat will be
reestablish alexei alexandrovitch told himself so far
reestablish that is that i shall not be sensibl of a break in the
continu of my life she is bound to be unhappi but i am not to
blame and so i cannot be unhappi

chapter 19
in spite of vronski appar frivol life in societi he wa a
man who hate irregular in earli youth in the corp of page he
had experienc the humili of a refus when he had tri be
in difficulti to borrow monei and sinc then he had never onc put
himself in the same posit again
in order to keep hi affair in some sort of order he us about five
time a year more or less frequent accord to circumst to
shut himself up alon and put all hi affair into definit shape thi
he us to call hi dai of reckon or fair la lessiv
on wake up the dai after the race vronski put on a white linen
coat and without shave or take hi bath he distribut about the
tabl monei bill and letter and set to work petritski who knew
he wa illtemp on such occas on wake up and see hi
comrad at the writingt quietli dress and went out without
get in hi wai
everi man who know to the minutest detail all the complex of the
condit surround him cannot help imagin that the complex
of these condit and the difficulti of make them clear is
someth except and person peculiar to himself and never
suppos that other ar surround by just as complic an arrai of
person affair as he is so inde it seem to vronski and not
without inward pride and not without reason he thought that ani other
man would long ago have been in difficulti would have been forc to
some dishonor cours if he had found himself in such a difficult
posit but vronski felt that now especi it wa essenti for him
to clear up and defin hi posit if he were to avoid get into
difficulti
what vronski attack first as be the easiest wa hi pecuniari
posit write out on note paper in hi minut hand all that he
ow he ad up the amount and found that hi debt amount to
seventeen thousand and some odd hundr which he left out for the
sake of clear reckon up hi monei and hi bank book he found
that he had left on thousand eight hundr roubl and noth come
in befor the new year reckon over again hi list of debt vronski
copi it divid it into three class in the first class he put
the debt which he would have to pai at onc or for which he must in
ani case have the monei readi so that on demand for payment there could
not be a moment delai in pai such debt amount to about four
thousand on thousand five hundr for a hors and two thousand five
hundr as sureti for a young comrad venovski who had lost that sum
to a cardsharp in vronski presenc vronski had want to pai the
monei at the time he had that amount then but venovski and yashvin
had insist that thei would pai and not vronski who had not plai
that wa so far well but vronski knew that in thi dirti busi
though hi onli share in it wa undertak by word of mouth to be
sureti for venovski it wa absolut necessari for him to have the
two thousand five hundr roubl so as to be abl to fling it at the
swindler and have no more word with him and so for thi first and
most import divis he must have four thousand roubl the second
classeight thousand roublesconsist of less import debt these
were princip account ow in connect with hi race hors to
the purveyor of oat and hai the english saddler and so on he would
have to pai some two thousand roubl on these debt too in order to
be quit free from anxieti the last class of debtsto shop to
hotel to hi tailorwer such as need not be consid so that he
need at least six thousand roubl for current expens and he onli
had on thousand eight hundr for a man with on hundr thousand
roubl of revenu which wa what everyon fix as vronski incom
such debt on would suppos could hardli be embarrass but the
fact wa that he wa far from have on hundr thousand hi father
immens properti which alon yield a yearli incom of two hundr
thousand wa left undivid between the brother at the time when the
elder brother with a mass of debt marri princess varya tchirkova
the daughter of a decembrist without ani fortun whatev alexei had
given up to hi elder brother almost the whole incom from hi father
estat reserv for himself onli twentyf thousand a year from it
alexei had said at the time to hi brother that that sum would be
suffici for him until he marri which he probabl never would do
and hi brother who wa in command of on of the most expens
regiment and wa onli just marri could not declin the gift hi
mother who had her own separ properti had allow alexei everi
year twenti thousand in addit to the twentyf thousand he had
reserv and alexei had spent it all of late hi mother incens
with him on account of hi love affair and hi leav moscow had
given up send him the monei and in consequ of thi vronski
who had been in the habit of live on the scale of fortyf thousand
a year have onli receiv twenti thousand that year found himself
now in difficulti to get out of these difficulti he could not
appli to hi mother for monei her last letter which he had receiv
the dai befor had particularli exasper him by the hint in it
that she wa quit readi to help him to succe in the world and in the
armi but not to lead a life which wa a scandal to all good societi
hi mother attempt to bui him stung him to the quick and made him
feel colder than ever to her but he could not draw back from the
gener word when it wa onc utter even though he felt now
vagu forese certain eventu in hi intrigu with madam
karenina that thi gener word had been spoken thoughtlessli and
that even though he were not marri he might need all the hundr
thousand of incom but it wa imposs to draw back he had onli to
recal hi brother wife to rememb how that sweet delight varya
sought at everi conveni opportun to remind him that she
rememb hi generos and appreci it to grasp the
imposs of take back hi gift it wa as imposs as beat
a woman steal or ly on thing onli could and ought to be done
and vronski determin upon it without an instant hesit to
borrow monei from a moneylend ten thousand roubl a proceed
which present no difficulti to cut down hi expens gener and
to sell hi race hors resolv on thi he promptli wrote a note to
rolandak who had more than onc sent to him with offer to bui hors
from him then he sent for the englishman and the moneylend and
divid what monei he had accord to the account he intend to pai
have finish thi busi he wrote a cold and cut answer to
hi mother then he took out of hi notebook three note of anna
read them again burn them and rememb their convers on the
previou dai he sank into medit
chapter 20
vronski life wa particularli happi in that he had a code of
principl which defin with unfail certitud what he ought and
what he ought not to do thi code of principl cover onli a veri
small circl of conting but then the principl were never
doubt and vronski as he never went outsid that circl had never
had a moment hesit about do what he ought to do these
principl laid down as invari rule that on must pai a
cardsharp but need not pai a tailor that on must never tell a lie
to a man but on mai to a woman that on must never cheat anyon but
on mai a husband that on must never pardon an insult but on mai
give on and so on these principl were possibl not reason and
not good but thei were of unfail certainti and so long as he
adher to them vronski felt that hi heart wa at peac and he could
hold hi head up onli quit late in regard to hi relat with
anna vronski had begun to feel that hi code of principl did not
fulli cover all possibl conting and to forese in the futur
difficulti and perplex for which he could find no guid clue
hi present relat to anna and to her husband wa to hi mind clear
and simpl it wa clearli and precis defin in the code of
principl by which he wa guid
she wa an honor woman who had bestow her love upon him and he
love her and therefor she wa in hi ey a woman who had a right to
the same or even more respect than a law wife he would have had
hi hand chop off befor he would have allow himself by a word by
a hint to humili her or even to fall short of the fullest respect
a woman could look for
hi attitud to societi too wa clear everyon might know might
suspect it but no on might dare to speak of it if ani did so he wa
readi to forc all who might speak to be silent and to respect the
nonexist honor of the woman he love
hi attitud to the husband wa the clearest of all from the moment
that anna love vronski he had regard hi own right over her as the
on thing unassail her husband wa simpli a superflu and
tiresom person no doubt he wa in a pitiabl posit but how could
that be help the on thing the husband had a right to wa to demand
satisfact with a weapon in hi hand and vronski wa prepar for
thi at ani minut
but of late new inner relat had arisen between him and her which
frighten vronski by their indefinit onli the dai befor she had
told him that she wa with child and he felt that thi fact and what
she expect of him call for someth not fulli defin in that code
of principl by which he had hitherto steer hi cours in life and
he had been inde caught unawar and at the first moment when she
spoke to him of her posit hi heart had prompt him to beg her to
leav her husband he had said that but now think thing over he
saw clearli that it would be better to manag to avoid that and at the
same time as he told himself so he wa afraid whether it wa not
wrong
if i told her to leav her husband that must mean unit her life
with mine am i prepar for that how can i take her awai now when i
have no monei suppos i could arrang but how can i take her
awai while im in the servic if i sai thati ought to be prepar to
do it that is i ought to have the monei and to retir from the armi
and he grew thought the question whether to retir from the servic
or not brought him to the other and perhap the chief though hidden
interest of hi life of which none knew but he
ambit wa the old dream of hi youth and childhood a dream which he
did not confess even to himself though it wa so strong that now thi
passion wa even do battl with hi love hi first step in the
world and in the servic had been success but two year befor he
had made a great mistak anxiou to show hi independ and to
advanc he had refus a post that had been offer him hope that
thi refus would heighten hi valu but it turn out that he had
been too bold and he wa pass over and have whether he like or
not taken up for himself the posit of an independ man he
carri it off with great tact and good sens behav as though he
bore no grudg against anyon did not regard himself as injur in ani
wai and care for noth but to be left alon sinc he wa enjoi
himself in realiti he had ceas to enjoi himself as long ago as the
year befor when he went awai to moscow he felt that thi independ
attitud of a man who might have done anyth but care to do
noth wa alreadi begin to pall that mani peopl were begin
to fanci that he wa not realli capabl of anyth but be a
straightforward goodnatur fellow hi connect with madam
karenina by creat so much sensat and attract gener
attent had given him a fresh distinct which sooth hi gnaw
worm of ambit for a while but a week befor that worm had been
rous up again with fresh forc the friend of hi childhood a man of
the same set of the same coteri hi comrad in the corp of page
serpuhovskoi who had left school with him and had been hi rival in
class in gymnast in their scrape and their dream of glori had
come back a few dai befor from central asia where he had gain two
step up in rank and an order rare bestow upon gener so young
as soon as he arriv in petersburg peopl began to talk about him as
a newli risen star of the first magnitud a schoolfellow of vronski
and of the same ag he wa a gener and wa expect a command
which might have influenc on the cours of polit event while
vronski independ and brilliant and belov by a charm woman
though he wa wa simpli a cavalri captain who wa readili allow to
be as independ as ever he like of cours i dont envi
serpuhovskoi and never could envi him but hi advanc show me
that on ha onli to watch on opportun and the career of a man
like me mai be veri rapidli made three year ago he wa in just the
same posit as i am if i retir i burn my ship if i remain in the
armi i lose noth she said herself she did not wish to chang her
posit and with her love i cannot feel enviou of serpuhovskoi and
slowli twirl hi mustach he got up from the tabl and walk
about the room hi ey shone particularli brightli and he felt in
that confid calm and happi frame of mind which alwai came after
he had thoroughli face hi posit everyth wa straight and
clear just as after former dai of reckon he shave took a cold
bath dress and went out

vronski check hi hint by a stern express of face i wa
greatli delight to hear of your success but not a bit surpris i

perhap you wouldnt confess to it if you hadnt been success
said vronski
i dont suppos so said serpuhovskoi smile again i wont sai
life wouldnt be worth live without it but it would be dull of
cours i mai be mistaken but i fanci i have a certain capac for the
line iv chosen and that power of ani sort in my hand if it is to
be will be better than in the hand of a good mani peopl i know
said serpuhovskoi with beam conscious of success and so the
nearer i get to it the better pleas i am
perhap that is true for you but not for everyon i us to think so
too but here i live and think life worth live not onli for that
there it out here it come said serpuhovskoi laugh ever
sinc i heard about you about your refus i began of cours i
approv of what you did but there ar wai of do everyth and i
think your action wa good in itself but you didnt do it quit in the
wai you ought to have done
what done cant be undon and you know i never go back on what iv

by whom
by whom by societi by russia russia need men she need a parti
or els everyth goe and will go to the dog
how do you mean bertenev parti against the russian communist
no said serpuhovskoi frown with vexat at be suspect of
such an absurd tout a est un blagu that alwai been and
alwai will be there ar no communist but intrigu peopl have to
invent a noxiou danger parti it an old trick no what want
is a power parti of independ men like you and me
but why so vronski mention a few men who were in power why
arent thei independ men
simpli becaus thei have not or have not had from birth an
independ fortun theyv not had a name theyv not been close to
the sun and center as we have thei can be bought either by monei or by
favor and thei have to find a support for themselv in invent a
polici and thei bring forward some notion some polici that thei dont
believ in that doe harm and the whole polici is realli onli a mean
to a govern hous and so much incom cela nest pa plu fin que
a when you get a peep at their card i mai be inferior to them
stupid perhap though i dont see why i should be inferior to them
but you and i have on import advantag over them for certain in
be more difficult to bui and such men ar more need than ever
vronski listen attent but he wa not so much interest by the
mean of the word as by the attitud of serpuhovskoi who wa alreadi
contempl a struggl with the exist power and alreadi had hi
like and dislik in that higher world while hi own interest in the
govern world did not go beyond the interest of hi regiment
vronski felt too how power serpuhovskoi might becom through hi
unmistak faculti for think thing out and for take thing in
through hi intellig and gift of word so rare met with in the
world in which he move and asham as he wa of the feel he felt
enviou
still i havent the on thing of most import for that he
answer i havent the desir for power i had it onc but it
gone
excus me that not true said serpuhovskoi smile
ye it is true it is true now vronski ad to be truth
ye it true now that anoth thing but that now wont last
forev
perhap answer vronski
you sai perhap serpuhovskoi went on as though guess hi
thought but i sai for certain and that what i want to see you
for your action wa just what it should have been i see that but you
ought not to keep it up i onli ask you to give me cart blanch im
not go to offer you my protect though inde why shouldnt
i protect youyouv protect me often enough i should hope our
friendship rise abov all that sort of thing ye he said smile
to him as tenderli as a woman give me cart blanch retir from
the regiment and ill draw you upward impercept
but you must understand that i want noth said vronski except
that all should be as it is
serpuhovskoi got up and stood face him
you sai that all should be as it is i understand what that mean but
listen were the same ag youv known a greater number of women
perhap than i have serpohovskoi smile and gestur told vronski
that he mustnt be afraid that he would be tender and care in
touch the sore place but im marri and believ me in get
to know thoroughli on wife if on love her as someon ha said
on get to know all women better than if on knew thousand of them
were come directli vronski shout to an offic who look into
the room and call them to the colonel
vronski wa long now to hear to the end and know what serpuhovskei
would sai to him
and here my opinion for you women ar the chief stumbl block in
a man career it hard to love a woman and do anyth there onli
on wai of have love conveni without it be a
hindrancethat marriag how how am i to tell you what i mean said
serpuhovskoi who like simil wait a minut wait a minut ye
just as you can onli carri a fardeau and do someth with your

the night spent by levin on the haycock did not pass without result for
him the wai in which he had been manag hi land revolt him and
had lost all attract for him in spite of the magnific harvest
never had there been or at least never it seem to him had there
been so mani hindranc and so mani quarrel between him and the
peasant as that year and the origin of these failur and thi
hostil wa now perfectli comprehens to him the delight he had
experienc in the work itself and the consequ greater intimaci
with the peasant the envi he felt of them of their life the desir
to adopt that life which had been to him that night not a dream but an
intent the execut of which he had thought out in detailal thi
had so transform hi view of the farm of the land as he had
manag it that he could not take hi former interest in it and could
not help see that unpleas relat between him and the workpeopl
which wa the foundat of it all the herd of improv cow such as
pava the whole land plough over and enrich the nine level field
surround with hedg the two hundr and forti acr heavili
manur the seed sown in drill and all the rest of itit wa all
splendid if onli the work had been done for themselv or for
themselv and comradespeopl in sympathi with them but he saw
clearli now hi work on a book of agricultur in which the chief
element in husbandri wa to have been the labor greatli assist him
in thi that the sort of farm he wa carri on wa noth but a
cruel and stubborn struggl between him and the labor in which
there wa on on sidehi sidea continu intens effort to chang
everyth to a pattern he consid better on the other side the
natur order of thing and in thi struggl he saw that with immens
expenditur of forc on hi side and with no effort or even intent
on the other side all that wa attain wa that the work did not go
to the like of either side and that splendid tool splendid cattl
and land were spoil with no good to anyon worst of all the energi
expend on thi work wa not simpli wast he could not help feel
now sinc the mean of thi system had becom clear to him that the
aim of hi energi wa a most unworthi on in realiti what wa the
struggl about he wa struggl for everi farth of hi share and
he could not help it for he had onli to relax hi effort and he
would not have had the monei to pai hi labor wage while thei
were onli struggl to be abl to do their work easili and agreeabl
that is to sai as thei were us to do it it wa for hi interest
that everi labor should work as hard as possibl and that while
do so he should keep hi wit about him so as to try not to break
the winnow machin the hors rake the thrash machin that
he should attend to what he wa do what the labor want wa to
work as pleasantli as possibl with rest and abov all carelessli
and heedlessli without think that summer levin saw thi at everi
step he sent the men to mow some clover for hai pick out the worst
patch where the clover wa overgrown with grass and weed and of no
us for seed again and again thei mow the best acr of clover
justifi themselv by the pretens that the bailiff had told them
to and try to pacifi him with the assur that it would be
splendid hai but he knew that it wa ow to those acr be so
much easier to mow he sent out a hai machin for pitch the hayit
wa broken at the first row becaus it wa dull work for a peasant to
sit on the seat in front with the great wing wave abov him and he
wa told dont troubl your honor sure the womenfolk will pitch
it quick enough the plough were practic useless becaus it
never occur to the labor to rais the share when he turn the
plough and forc it round he strain the hors and tore up the
ground and levin wa beg not to mind about it the hors were
allow to strai into the wheat becaus not a singl labor would
consent to be nightwatchman and in spite of order to the contrari
the labor insist on take turn for night duti and ivan after
work all dai long fell asleep and wa veri penit for hi fault
sai do what you will to me your honor
thei kill three of the best calv by let them into the clover
aftermath without care as to their drink and noth would make the
men believ that thei had been blown out by the clover but thei told
him by wai of consol that on of hi neighbor had lost a
hundr and twelv head of cattl in three dai all thi happen not
becaus anyon felt illwil to levin or hi farm on the contrari he
knew that thei like him thought him a simpl gentleman their highest
prais but it happen simpli becaus all thei want wa to work
merrili and carelessli and hi interest were not onli remot and
incomprehens to them but fatal oppos to their most just
claim long befor levin had felt dissatisfact with hi own
posit in regard to the land he saw where hi boat leak but he
did not look for the leak perhap purpos deceiv himself
noth would be left him if he lost faith in it but now he could
deceiv himself no longer the farm of the land as he wa manag
it had becom not mere unattract but revolt to him and he
could take no further interest in it
to thi now wa join the presenc onli twentyf mile off of
kitti shtcherbatskaya whom he long to see and could not see darya
alexandrovna oblonskaya had invit him when he wa over there to
come to come with the object of renew hi offer to her sister who
would so she gave him to understand accept him now levin himself had
felt on see kitti shtcherbatskaya that he had never ceas to love
her but he could not go over to the oblonski know she wa there
the fact that he had made her an offer and she had refus him had
place an insuper barrier between her and him i cant ask her to
be my wife mere becaus she cant be the wife of the man she want
to marri he said to himself the thought of thi made him cold and
hostil to her i should not be abl to speak to her without a feel
of reproach i could not look at her without resent and she will
onli hate me all the more as she bound to and besid how can i
now after what darya alexandrovna told me go to see them can i help

darya alexandrovna sent him a letter ask him for a sidesaddl for
kitti us im told you have a sidesaddl she wrote to him i
hope you will bring it over yourself
thi wa more than he could stand how could a woman of ani
intellig of ani delicaci put her sister in such a humili
posit he wrote ten note and tore them all up and sent the saddl
without ani repli to write that he would go wa imposs becaus he
could not go to write that he could not come becaus someth
prevent him or that he would be awai that wa still wors he sent
the saddl without an answer and with a sens of have done someth
shame he hand over all the now revolt busi of the estat

ye ye that how it is sir said the old man get up and
cross himself deliber he thank levin and went out
when levin went into the kitchen to call hi coachman he saw the whole
famili at dinner the women were stand up wait on them the
young sturdylook son wa tell someth funni with hi mouth
full of pud and thei were all laugh the woman in the clog
who wa pour cabbag soup into a bowl laugh most merrili of all
veri probabl the goodlook face of the young woman in the clog had
a good deal to do with the impress of wellb thi peasant
household made upon levin but the impress wa so strong that levin
could never get rid of it and all the wai from the old peasant to
sviazhski he kept recal thi peasant farm as though there were
someth in thi impress that demand hi special attent
chapter 26
sviazhski wa the marshal of hi district he wa five year older than
levin and had long been marri hi sisterinlaw a young girl levin
like veri much live in hi hous and levin knew that sviazhski and
hi wife would have greatli like to marri the girl to him he knew
thi with certainti as socal elig young men alwai know it
though he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyon
and he knew too that although he want to get marri and although
by everi token thi veri attract girl would make an excel wife
he could no more have marri her even if he had not been in love with
kitti shtcherbatskaya than he could have flown up to the sky and thi
knowledg poison the pleasur he had hope to find in the visit to
sviazhski
on get sviazhski letter with the invit for shoot levin
had immedi thought of thi but in spite of it he had made up hi
mind that sviazhski have such view for him wa simpli hi own
groundless supposit and so he would go all the same besid at
the bottom of hi heart he had a desir to try himself put himself to
the test in regard to thi girl the sviazhski homelif wa
exceedingli pleasant and sviazhski himself the best type of man
take part in local affair that levin knew wa veri interest to
him
sviazhski wa on of those peopl alwai a sourc of wonder to levin
whose convict veri logic though never origin go on wai by
themselv while their life exceedingli definit and firm in it
direct goe it wai quit apart and almost alwai in direct
contradict to their convict sviazhski wa an extrem advanc
man he despis the nobil and believ the mass of the nobil to
be secretli in favor of serfdom and onli conceal their view from
cowardic he regard russia as a ruin countri rather after the
style of turkei and the govern of russia as so bad that he never
permit himself to critic it do serious and yet he wa a
functionari of that govern and a model marshal of nobil and
when he drove about he alwai wore the cockad of offic and the cap
with the red band he consid human life onli toler abroad and
went abroad to stai at everi opportun and at the same time he
carri on a complex and improv system of agricultur in russia and
with extrem interest follow everyth and knew everyth that wa
be done in russia he consid the russian peasant as occupi a
stage of develop intermedi between the ap and the man and at
the same time in the local assembl no on wa readier to shake hand
with the peasant and listen to their opinion he believ neither in
god nor the devil but wa much concern about the question of the
improv of the clergi and the mainten of their revenu and
took special troubl to keep up the church in hi villag
on the woman question he wa on the side of the extrem advoc of
complet liberti for women and especi their right to labor but he
live with hi wife on such term that their affection childless
home life wa the admir of everyon and arrang hi wife life
so that she did noth and could do noth but share her husband
effort that her time should pass as happili and as agreeabl as
possibl
if it had not been a characterist of levin to put the most
favor interpret on peopl sviazhski charact would have
present no doubt or difficulti to him he would have said to himself
a fool or a knave and everyth would have seem clear but he
could not sai a fool becaus sviazhski wa unmistak clever and
moreov a highli cultiv man who wa exception modest over
hi cultur there wa not a subject he knew noth of but he did not
displai hi knowledg except when he wa compel to do so still less
could levin sai that he wa a knave as sviazhski wa unmistak an
honest goodheart sensibl man who work goodhumoredli keenli
and perseveringli at hi work he wa held in high honor by everyon
about him and certainli he had never conscious done and wa inde
incap of do anyth base
levin tri to understand him and could not understand him and look
at him and hi life as at a live enigma
levin and he were veri friendli and so levin us to ventur to sound
sviazhski to try to get at the veri foundat of hi view of life
but it wa alwai in vain everi time levin tri to penetr beyond
the outer chamber of sviazhski mind which were hospit open to
all he notic that sviazhski wa slightli disconcert faint sign
of alarm were visibl in hi ey as though he were afraid levin would
understand him and he would give him a kindli goodhumor repuls
just now sinc hi disenchant with farm levin wa particularli
glad to stai with sviazhski apart from the fact that the sight of thi
happi and affection coupl so pleas with themselv and everyon
els and their wellord home had alwai a cheer effect on
levin he felt a long now that he wa so dissatisfi with hi own
life to get at that secret in sviazhski that gave him such clear
definit and good courag in life moreov levin knew that at
sviazhski he should meet the landown of the neighborhood and it
wa particularli interest for him just now to hear and take part in
those rural convers concern crop labor wage and so on
which he wa awar ar convention regard as someth veri low
but which seem to him just now to constitut the on subject of
import it wa not perhap of import in the dai of serfdom
and it mai not be of import in england in both case the
condit of agricultur ar firmli establish but among us now
when everyth ha been turn upsid down and is onli just take
shape the question what form these condit will take is the on
question of import in russia thought levin
the shoot turn out to be wors than levin had expect the marsh
wa dry and there were no grous at all he walk about the whole dai
and onli brought back three bird but to make up for thath brought
back as he alwai did from shoot an excel appetit excel
spirit and that keen intellectu mood which with him alwai
accompani violent physic exert and while out shoot when he
seem to be think of noth at all suddenli the old man and hi
famili kept come back to hi mind and the impress of them seem
to claim not mere hi attent but the solut of some question
connect with them
in the even at tea two landown who had come about some busi
connect with a wardship were of the parti and the interest
convers levin had been look forward to sprang up
levin wa sit besid hi hostess at the tea tabl and wa oblig
to keep up a convers with her and her sister who wa sit
opposit him madam sviazhskaya wa a roundfac fairhair rather
short woman all smile and dimpl levin tri through her to get a
solut of the weighti enigma her husband present to hi mind but
he had not complet freedom of idea becaus he wa in an agoni of
embarrass thi agoni of embarrass wa due to the fact that the
sisterinlaw wa sit opposit to him in a dress special put
on as he fanci for hi benefit cut particularli open in the shape
of a trapez on her white bosom thi quadrangular open in spite
of the bosom be veri white or just becaus it wa veri white
depriv levin of the full us of hi faculti he imagin probabl
mistakenli that thi lowneck bodic had been made on hi account
and felt that he had no right to look at it and tri not to look at
it but he felt that he wa to blame for the veri fact of the
lowneck bodic have been made it seem to levin that he had
deceiv someon that he ought to explain someth but that to
explain it wa imposs and for that reason he wa continu
blush wa ill at eas and awkward hi awkward infect the
pretti sisterinlaw too but their hostess appear not to observ
thi and kept purpos draw her into the convers
you sai she said pursu the subject that had been start that
my husband cannot be interest in what russian it quit the
contrari he is alwai in cheer spirit abroad but not as he is
here here he feel in hi proper place he ha so much to do and he
ha the faculti of interest himself in everyth oh youv not
been to see our school have you
iv seen it the littl hous cover with ivi isnt it
ye that nastia work she said indic her sister
you teach in it yourself ask levin try to look abov the open
neck but feel that wherev he look in that direct he should
see it
ye i us to teach in it myself and do teach still but we have a
firstrat schoolmistress now and weve start gymnast exercis
no thank you i wont have ani more tea said levin and consciou
of do a rude thing but incap of continu the convers he
got up blush i hear a veri interest convers he ad
and walk to the other end of the tabl where sviazhski wa sit
with the two gentlemen of the neighborhood sviazhski wa sit
sidewai with on elbow on the tabl and a cup in on hand while
with the other hand he gather up hi beard held it to hi nose and
let it drop again as though he were smell it hi brilliant black
ey were look straight at the excit countri gentleman with grai
whisker and appar he deriv amus from hi remark the
gentleman wa complain of the peasant it wa evid to levin that
sviazhski knew an answer to thi gentleman complaint which would at
onc demolish hi whole content but that in hi posit he could
not give utter to thi answer and listen not without pleasur
to the landown comic speech
the gentleman with the grai whisker wa obvious an inveter
adher of serfdom and a devot agriculturist who had live all hi
life in the countri levin saw proof of thi in hi dress in the
oldfashion threadbar coat obvious not hi everydai attir in
hi shrewd deepset ey in hi idiomat fluent russian in the
imperi tone that had becom habitu from long us and in the
resolut gestur of hi larg red sunburnt hand with an old
betroth ring on the littl finger
chapter 27
if id onli the heart to throw up what been set go such a lot
of troubl wast id turn my back on the whole busi sell up
go off like nikolai ivanovitch to hear la bell hlne said the
landown a pleasant smile light up hi shrewd old face
but you see you dont throw it up said nikolai ivanovitch sviazhski
so there must be someth gain
the onli gain is that i live in my own hous neither bought nor
hire besid on keep hope the peopl will learn sens though
instead of that youd never believ itth drunken the
immor thei keep chop and chang their bit of land not a
sight of a hors or a cow the peasant dy of hunger but just go
and take him on as a labor hell do hi best to do you a mischief
and then bring you up befor the justic of the peac
but then you make complaint to the justic too said sviazhski
i lodg complaint not for anyth in the world such a talk and
such a todo that on would have caus to regret it at the work for
instanc thei pocket the advancemonei and made off what did the
justic do why acquit them noth keep them in order but their
own commun court and their villag elder hell flog them in the good
old style but for that there be noth for it but to give it all up
and run awai
obvious the landown wa chaf sviazhski who far from resent
it wa appar amus by it
but you see we manag our land without such extrem measur said
he smile levin and i and thi gentleman
he indic the other landown
ye the thing done at mihail petrovitch but ask him how it
done do you call that a ration system said the landown
obvious rather proud of the word ration
my system veri simpl said mihail petrovitch thank god all my
manag rest on get the monei readi for the autumn tax and
the peasant come to me father master help us well the peasant
ar all on neighbor on feel for them so on advanc them a
third but on sai rememb lad i have help you and you must
help me when i need itwheth it the sow of the oat or the
haycut or the harvest and well on agre so much for each
taxpayerthough there ar dishonest on among them too it true
levin who had long been familiar with these patriarch method
exchang glanc with sviazhski and interrupt mihail petrovitch
turn again to the gentleman with the grai whisker
then what do you think he ask what system is on to adopt
nowadai
why manag like mihail petrovitch or let the land for half the crop
or for rent to the peasant that on can doonli that just how the
gener prosper of the countri is be ruin where the land with
serflabor and good manag gave a yield of nine to on on the
halfcrop system it yield three to on russia ha been ruin by the
emancip
sviazhski look with smile ey at levin and even made a faint
gestur of ironi to him but levin did not think the landown word
absurd he understood them better than he did sviazhski a great deal
more of what the gentleman with the grai whisker said to show in what
wai russia wa ruin by the emancip struck him inde as veri
true new to him and quit incontest the landown unmistak
spoke hi own individu thoughta thing that veri rare happensand a
thought to which he had been brought not by a desir of find some
exercis for an idl brain but a thought which had grown up out of the
condit of hi life which he had brood over in the solitud of
hi villag and had consid in everi aspect
the point is dont you see that progress of everi sort is onli made
by the us of author he said evid wish to show he wa not
without cultur take the reform of peter of catherin of
alexand take european histori and progress in agricultur more than
anyth elseth potato for instanc that wa introduc among us by
forc the wooden plough too wasnt alwai us it wa introduc
mayb in the dai befor the empir but it wa probabl brought in by
forc now in our own dai we landown in the serf time us
variou improv in our husbandri dry machin and thrash
machin and cart manur and all the modern implementsal that we
brought into us by our author and the peasant oppos it at
first and end by imit us now by the abolit of serfdom we
have been depriv of our author and so our husbandri where it had
been rais to a high level is bound to sink to the most savag
primit condit that how i see it
but why so if it ration youll be abl to keep up the same
system with hire labor said sviazhski
weve no power over them with whom am i go to work the system
allow me to ask
there it isth labor forceth chief element in agricultur thought
levin
with labor
the labor wont work well and wont work with good implement our
labor can do noth but get drunk like a pig and when he drunk he
ruin everyth you give him he make the hors ill with too much
water cut good har barter the tire of the wheel for drink
drop bit of iron into the thrash machin so as to break it he
loath the sight of anyth that not after hi fashion and that
how it is the whole level of husbandri ha fallen land gone out of
cultiv overgrown with weed or divid among the peasant and
where million of bushel were rais you get a hundr thousand the
wealth of the countri ha decreas if the same thing had been done
but with care that
and he proceed to unfold hi own scheme of emancip by mean of
which these drawback might have been avoid
thi did not interest levin but when he had finish levin went back
to hi first posit and address sviazhski and try to draw
him into express hi seriou opinion
that the standard of cultur is fall and that with our present
relat to the peasant there is no possibl of farm on a
ration system to yield a profitthat perfectli true said he
i dont believ it sviazhski repli quit serious all i see is
that we dont know how to cultiv the land and that our system of
agricultur in the serf dai wa by no mean too high but too low we
have no machin no good stock no effici supervis we dont
even know how to keep account ask ani landown he wont be abl to
tell you what crop profit and what not
italian bookkeep said the gentleman of the grai whisker
iron you mai keep your book as you like but if thei spoil
everyth for you there wont be ani profit
why do thei spoil thing a poor thrash machin or your russian
presser thei will break but my steam press thei dont break a
wretch russian nag theyll ruin but keep good drayhorsesthei wont
ruin them and so it is all round we must rais our farm to a
higher level
oh if on onli had the mean to do it nikolai ivanovitch it all
veri well for you but for me with a son to keep at the univers
lad to be educ at the high schoolhow am i go to bui these
drayhors
well that what the land bank ar for
to get what left me sold by auction no thank you
i dont agre that it necessari or possibl to rais the level of
agricultur still higher said levin i devot myself to it and i
have mean but i can do noth as to the bank i dont know to whom
theyr ani good for my part anywai whatev iv spent monei on in
the wai of husbandri it ha been a loss stocka loss machinerya
loss
that true enough the gentleman with the grai whisker chime in
posit laugh with satisfact
and im not the onli on pursu levin i mix with all the
neighbor landown who ar cultiv their land on a ration
system thei all with rare except ar do so at a loss come
tell us how doe your land dodo it pai said levin and at onc in
sviazhski ey he detect that fleet express of alarm which he
had notic whenev he had tri to penetr beyond the outer
chamber of sviazhski mind
moreov thi question on levin part wa not quit in good faith
madam sviazhskaya had just told him at tea that thei had that summer
invit a german expert in bookkeep from moscow who for a
consider of five hundr roubl had investig the manag
of their properti and found that it wa cost them a loss of three
thousand odd roubl she did not rememb the precis sum but it
appear that the german had work it out to the fraction of a
farth
the graywhisk landown smile at the mention of the profit of
sviazhski farm obvious awar how much gain hi neighbor and
marshal wa like to be make
possibl it doe not pai answer sviazhski that mere prove
either that im a bad manag or that iv sunk my capit for the
increas of my rent
oh rent levin cri with horror rent there mai be in europ
where land ha been improv by the labor put into it but with us all
the land is deterior from the labor put into itin other word
theyr work it out so there no question of rent
how no rent it a law
then were outsid the law rent explain noth for us but simpli
muddl us no tell me how there can be a theori of rent
will you have some junket masha pass us some junket or raspberri
he turn to hi wife extraordinarili late the raspberri ar
last thi year
and in the happiest frame of mind sviazhski got up and walk off
appar suppos the convers to have end at the veri point
when to levin it seem that it wa onli just begin
have lost hi antagonist levin continu the convers with the
graywhisk landown try to prove to him that all the
difficulti aris from the fact that we dont find out the
peculiar and habit of our labor but the landown like all
men who think independ and in isol wa slow in take in ani
other person idea and particularli partial to hi own he stuck to
it that the russian peasant is a swine and like swinish and that
to get him out of hi swinish on must have author and there is
none on must have the stick and we have becom so liber that we
have all of a sudden replac the stick that serv us for a thousand
year by lawyer and model prison where the worthless stink
peasant is fed on good soup and ha a fix allow of cubic feet of
air
what make you think said levin try to get back to the question
that it imposs to find some relat to the labor in which the
labor would becom product
that never could be so with the russian peasantri weve no power over
them answer the landown
how can new condit be found said sviazhski have eaten some
junket and light a cigarett he came back to the discuss all
possibl relat to the labor forc have been defin and studi
he said the relic of barbar the primit commun with each
guarante for all will disappear of itself serfdom ha been
abolishedther remain noth but free labor and it form ar fix
and readi made and must be adopt perman hand daylabor
rammersy cant get out of those form
but europ is dissatisfi with these form
dissatisfi and seek new on and will find them in all
probabl
that just what i wa mean answer levin why shouldnt we
seek them for ourselv
becaus it would be just like invent afresh the mean for
construct railwai thei ar readi invent
but if thei dont do for us if theyr stupid said levin
and again he detect the express of alarm in the ey of sviazhski
oh ye well buri the world under our cap weve found the secret
europ wa seek for iv heard all that but excus me do you
know all that been done in europ on the question of the organ
of labor
no veri littl
that question is now absorb the best mind in europ the
schulzedelitsch movement and then all thi enorm literatur of
the labor question the most liber lassal movement the
mulhausen experi that a fact by now as your probabl awar
i have some idea of it but veri vagu
no you onli sai that no doubt you know all about it as well as i do
im not a professor of sociolog of cours but it interest me and
realli if it interest you you ought to studi it
but what conclus have thei come to
excus me
the two neighbor had risen and sviazhski onc more check levin in
hi inconveni habit of peep into what wa beyond the outer
chamber of hi mind went to see hi guest out
chapter 28
levin wa insuffer bore that even with the ladi he wa
stir as he had never been befor by the idea that the
dissatisfact he wa feel with hi system of manag hi land wa
not an except case but the gener condit of thing in russia
that the organ of some relat of the labor to the soil in
which thei would work as with the peasant he had met halfwai to the
sviazhski wa not a dream but a problem which must be solv and
it seem to him that the problem could be solv and that he ought to
try and solv it
after sai goodnight to the ladi and promis to stai the whole
of the next dai so as to make an expedit on horseback with them to
see an interest ruin in the crown forest levin went befor go
to bed into hi host studi to get the book on the labor question
that sviazhski had offer him sviazhski studi wa a huge room
surround by bookcas and with two tabl in iton a massiv
writingt stand in the middl of the room and the other a
round tabl cover with recent number of review and journal in
differ languag rang like the rai of a star round the lamp on
the writingt wa a stand of drawer mark with gold letter
and full of paper of variou sort
sviazhski took out the book and sat down in a rockingchair
what ar you look at there he said to levin who wa stand at
the round tabl look through the review
oh ye there a veri interest articl here said sviazhski of
the review levin wa hold in hi hand it appear he went on
with eager interest that friedrich wa not after all the person
chiefli respons for the partit of poland it is prove
and with hi characterist clear he sum up those new veri
import and interest revel although levin wa engross at
the moment by hi idea about the problem of the land he wonder as
he heard sviazhski what is there insid of him and why why is he
interest in the partit of poland when sviazhski had finish
levin could not help ask well and what then but there wa
noth to follow it wa simpli interest that it had been prove to
be so and so but sviazhski did not explain and saw no need to explain
why it wa interest to him
ye but i wa veri much interest by your irrit neighbor said
levin sigh he a clever fellow and said a lot that wa true
oh get along with you an inveter support of serfdom at heart
like all of them said sviazhski
whose marshal you ar
ye onli i marshal them in the other direct said sviazhski
laugh
ill tell you what interest me veri much said levin he right
that our system that to sai of ration farm doesnt answer
that the onli thing that answer is the moneylend system like that
meeklook gentleman or els the veri simplest whose fault is
it
our own of cours besid it not true that it doesnt answer it
answer with vassiltchikov
a factori
but i realli dont know what it is you ar surpris at the peopl
ar at such a low stage of ration and moral develop that it
obviou theyr bound to oppos everyth that strang to them in
europ a ration system answer becaus the peopl ar educ it
follow that we must educ the peoplethat all
but how ar we to educ the peopl
to educ the peopl three thing ar need school and school
and school
but you said yourself the peopl ar at such a low stage of materi
develop what help ar school for that
do you know you remind me of the stori of the advic given to the
sick manyou should try purg medicin taken wors try leech
tri them wors well then there noth left but to prai to god
tri it wors that just how it is with us i sai polit
economi you saywors i sai social wors educ wors
but how do school help matter
thei give the peasant fresh want
well that a thing iv never understood levin repli with heat
in what wai ar school go to help the peopl to improv their
materi posit you sai school educ will give them fresh
want so much the wors sinc thei wont be capabl of satisfi
them and in what wai a knowledg of addit and subtract and the
catech is go to improv their materi condit i never could
make out the dai befor yesterdai i met a peasant woman in the
even with a littl babi and ask her where she wa go she said
she wa go to the wise woman her boi had scream fit so she wa
take him to be doctor i ask why how doe the wise woman cure
scream fit she put the child on the henroost and repeat some
charm
well your sai it yourself what want to prevent her take
her child to the henroost to cure it of scream fit is just
sviazhski said smile goodhumoredli
oh no said levin with annoy that method of doctor i mere
meant as a simil for doctor the peopl with school the peopl ar
poor and ignorantthat we see as sure as the peasant woman see the
babi is ill becaus it scream but in what wai thi troubl of poverti
and ignor is to be cure by school is as incomprehens as how
the henroost affect the scream what ha to be cure is what make
him poor
well in that at least your in agreement with spencer whom you
dislik so much he sai too that educ mai be the consequ of
greater prosper and comfort of more frequent wash as he sai
but not of be abl to read and write
well then im veri glador the contrari veri sorri that im in
agreement with spencer onli iv known it a long while school can do
no good what will do good is an econom organ in which the
peopl will becom richer will have more leisureand then there will
be school
still all over europ now school ar obligatori
and how far do you agre with spencer yourself about it ask levin
but there wa a gleam of alarm in sviazhski ey and he said
smile
no that scream stori is posit capit did you realli hear it
yourself
levin saw that he wa not to discov the connect between thi man
life and hi thought obvious he did not care in the least what hi
reason led him to all he want wa the process of reason and
he did not like it when the process of reason brought him into a
blind allei that wa the onli thing he dislik and avoid by
chang the convers to someth agreeabl and amus
all the impress of the dai begin with the impress made by
the old peasant which serv as it were as the fundament basi of
all the concept and idea of the dai threw levin into violent
excit thi dear good sviazhski keep a stock of idea simpli
for social purpos and obvious have some other principl hidden
from levin while with the crowd whose name is legion he guid
public opinion by idea he did not share that irasc countri
gentleman perfectli correct in the conclus that he had been
worri into by life but wrong in hi exasper against a whole
class and that the best class in russia hi own dissatisfact with
the work he had been do and the vagu hope of find a remedi for
all thisal wa blend in a sens of inward turmoil and anticip
of some solut near at hand
left alon in the room assign him ly on a spring mattress that
yield unexpectedli at everi movement of hi arm or hi leg levin did
not fall asleep for a long while not on convers with sviazhski
though he had said a great deal that wa clever had interest levin
but the conclus of the irasc landown requir consider
levin could not help recal everi word he had said and in
imagin amend hi own repli
ye i ought to have said to him you sai that our husbandri doe not
answer becaus the peasant hate improv and that thei must be
forc on him by author if no system of husbandri answer at all
without these improv you would be quit right but the onli
system that doe answer is where labor is work in accord with
hi habit just as on the old peasant land halfwai here your and
our gener dissatisfact with the system show that either we ar to
blame or the labor we have gone our wayth european waya long
while without ask ourselv about the qualiti of our labor forc
let us try to look upon the labor forc not as an abstract forc but
as the russian peasant with hi instinct and we shall arrang our
system of cultur in accord with that imagin i ought to have
said to him that you have the same system as the old peasant ha that
you have found mean of make your labor take an interest in the
success of the work and have found the happi mean in the wai of
improv which thei will admit and you will without exhaust
the soil get twice or three time the yield you got befor divid it
in halv give half as the share of labor the surplu left you will
be greater and the share of labor will be greater too and to do thi
on must lower the standard of husbandri and interest the labor in
it success how to do thisthat a matter of detail but undoubtedli
it can be done
thi idea threw levin into a great excit he did not sleep half
the night think over in detail the put of hi idea into
practic he had not intend to go awai next dai but he now
determin to go home earli in the morn besid the sisterinlaw
with her lowneck bodic arous in him a feel akin to shame and
remors for some utterli base action most import of allh must get
back without delai he would have to make hast to put hi new project
to the peasant befor the sow of the winter wheat so that the
sow might be undertaken on a new basi he had made up hi mind to
revolution hi whole system
chapter 29
the carri out of levin plan present mani difficulti but he
struggl on do hi utmost and attain a result which though not
what he desir wa enough to enabl him without selfdecept to
believ that the attempt wa worth the troubl on of the chief
difficulti wa that the process of cultiv the land wa in full
swing that it wa imposs to stop everyth and begin it all again
from the begin and the machin had to be mend while in motion
when on the even that he arriv home he inform the bailiff of hi
plan the latter with visibl pleasur agre with what he said so
long as he wa point out that all that had been done up to that time
wa stupid and useless the bailiff said that he had said so a long
while ago but no heed had been paid him but as for the propos made
by levinto take a part as sharehold with hi labor in each
agricultur undertakingat thi the bailiff simpli express a
profound despond and offer no definit opinion but began
immedi talk of the urgent necess of carri the remain
sheav of rye the next dai and of send the men out for the second
plough so that levin felt that thi wa not the time for discuss
it
on begin to talk to the peasant about it and make a proposit
to cede them the land on new term he came into collis with the
same great difficulti that thei were so much absorb by the current
work of the dai that thei had not time to consid the advantag and
disadvantag of the propos scheme
the simpleheart ivan the cowherd seem complet to grasp
levin proposalthat he should with hi famili take a share of the
profit of the cattleyardand he wa in complet sympathi with the
plan but when levin hint at the futur advantag ivan face
express alarm and regret that he could not hear all he had to sai
and he made hast to find himself some task that would admit of no
delai he either snatch up the fork to pitch the hai out of the pen
or ran to get water or to clear out the dung
anoth difficulti lai in the invinc disbelief of the peasant that
a landown object could be anyth els than a desir to squeez
all he could out of them thei were firmli convinc that hi real aim
whatev he might sai to them would alwai be in what he did not sai
to them and thei themselv in give their opinion said a great
deal but never said what wa their real object moreov levin felt
that the irasc landown had been right the peasant made their
first and unalter condit of ani agreement whatev that thei
should not be forc to ani new method of tillag of ani kind nor to
us new implement thei agre that the modern plough plough better
that the scarifi did the work more quickli but thei found thousand
of reason that made it out of the question for them to us either of
them and though he had accept the convict that he would have to
lower the standard of cultiv he felt sorri to give up improv
method the advantag of which were so obviou but in spite of all
these difficulti he got hi wai and by autumn the system wa
work or at least so it seem to him
at first levin had thought of give up the whole farm of the land
just as it wa to the peasant the labor and the bailiff on new
condit of partnership but he wa veri soon convinc that thi wa
imposs and determin to divid it up the cattleyard the
garden hai field and arabl land divid into sever part had to
be made into separ lot the simpleheart cowherd ivan who
levin fanci understood the matter better than ani of them
collect togeth a gang of worker to help him princip of hi
own famili becam a partner in the cattleyard a distant part of the
estat a tract of wast land that had lain fallow for eight year wa
with the help of the clever carpent fyodor ryezunov taken by six
famili of peasant on new condit of partnership and the peasant
shuraev took the manag of all the veget garden on the same
term the remaind of the land wa still work on the old system
but these three associ partnership were the first step to a new
organ of the whole and thei complet took up levin time
it is true that in the cattleyard thing went no better than befor
and ivan strenuous oppos warm hous for the cow and butter made
of fresh cream affirm that cow requir less food if kept cold and
that butter is more profit made from sour cream and he ask for
wage just as under the old system and took not the slightest interest
in the fact that the monei he receiv wa not wage but an advanc out
of hi futur share in the profit
it is true that fyodor ryezunov compani did not plough over the
ground twice befor sow as had been agre justifi themselv
on the plea that the time wa too short it is true that the peasant
of the same compani though thei had agre to work the land on new
condit alwai spoke of the land not as held in partnership but
as rent for half the crop and more than onc the peasant and
ryezunov himself said to levin if you would take a rent for the land
it would save you troubl and we should be more free moreov the
same peasant kept put off on variou excus the build of a
cattleyard and barn on the land as agre upon and delai do it
till the winter
it is true that shuraev would have like to let out the kitchen garden
he had undertaken in small lot to the peasant he evid quit
misunderstood and appar intention misunderstood the
condit upon which the land had been given to him
often too talk to the peasant and explain to them all the
advantag of the plan levin felt that the peasant heard noth but
the sound of hi voic and were firmli resolv whatev he might
sai not to let themselv be taken in he felt thi especi when he
talk to the cleverest of the peasant ryezunov and detect the
gleam in ryezunov ey which show so plainli both iron
amus at levin and the firm convict that if anyon were to be
taken in it would not be he ryezunov but in spite of all thi levin
thought the system work and that by keep account strictli and
insist on hi own wai he would prove to them in the futur the
advantag of the arrang and then the system would go of itself
these matter togeth with the manag of the land still left on
hi hand and the indoor work over hi book so engross levin the
whole summer that he scarc ever went out shoot at the end of
august he heard that the oblonski had gone awai to moscow from their
servant who brought back the sidesaddl he felt that in not answer
darya alexandrovna letter he had by hi rude of which he could
not think without a flush of shame burn hi ship and that he would
never go and see them again he had been just as rude with the
sviazhski leav them without sai goodby but he would never go
to see them again either he did not care about that now the busi
of reorgan the farm of hi land absorb him as complet as
though there would never be anyth els in hi life he read the
book lent him by sviazhski and copi out what he had not got he
read both the econom and socialist book on the subject but as he
had anticip found noth bear on the scheme he had undertaken
in the book on polit economyin mill for instanc whom he
studi first with great ardor hope everi minut to find an answer
to the question that were engross himh found law deduc from
the condit of land cultur in europ but he did not see why these
law which did not appli in russia must be gener he saw just the
same thing in the socialist book either thei were the beauti but
impractic fantasi which had fascin him when he wa a student
or thei were attempt at improv rectifi the econom posit in
which europ wa place with which the system of land tenur in russia
had noth in common polit economi told him that the law by
which the wealth of europ had been develop and wa develop were
univers and unvari social told him that develop along
these line lead to ruin and neither of them gave an answer or even
a hint in repli to the question what he levin and all the russian
peasant and landown were to do with their million of hand and
million of acr to make them as product as possibl for the
common weal
have onc taken the subject up he read conscienti everyth
bear on it and intend in the autumn to go abroad to studi land
system on the spot in order that he might not on thi question be
confront with what so often met him on variou subject often just
as he wa begin to understand the idea in the mind of anyon he wa
talk to and wa begin to explain hi own he would suddenli be
told but kauffmann but jone but duboi but michelli you havent
read them theyv thrash that question out thoroughli
he saw now distinctli that kauffmann and michelli had noth to tell
him he knew what he want he saw that russia ha splendid land
splendid labor and that in certain case as at the peasant on
the wai to sviazhski the produc rais by the labor and the land
is greatin the major of case when capit is appli in the
european wai the produc is small and that thi simpli aris from the
fact that the labor want to work and work well onli in their own
peculiar wai and that thi antagon is not incident but
invari and ha it root in the nation spirit he thought that
the russian peopl whose task it wa to colon and cultiv vast
tract of unoccupi land conscious adher till all their land wa
occupi to the method suitabl to their purpos and that their
method were by no mean so bad as wa gener suppos and he
want to prove thi theoret in hi book and practic on hi
land
chapter 30
at the end of septemb the timber had been cart for build the
cattleyard on the land that had been allot to the associ of
peasant and the butter from the cow wa sold and the profit
divid in practic the system work capit or at least so it
seem to levin in order to work out the whole subject theoret
and to complet hi book which in levin daydream wa not mere
to effect a revolut in polit economi but to annihil that
scienc entir and to lai the foundat of a new scienc of the
relat of the peopl to the soil all that wa left to do wa to make
a tour abroad and to studi on the spot all that had been done in the
same direct and to collect conclus evid that all that had
been done there wa not what wa want levin wa onli wait for the
deliveri of hi wheat to receiv the monei for it and go abroad but
the rain began prevent the harvest of the corn and potato
left in the field and put a stop to all work even to the
deliveri of the wheat
the mud wa impass along the road two mill were carri awai
and the weather got wors and wors
on the 30th of septemb the sun came out in the morn and hope
for fine weather levin began make final prepar for hi
journei he gave order for the wheat to be deliv sent the bailiff
to the merchant to get the monei ow him and went out himself to
give some final direct on the estat befor set off
have finish all hi busi soak through with the stream of
water which kept run down the leather behind hi neck and hi
gaiter but in the keenest and most confid temper levin return
homeward in the even the weather had becom wors than ever
toward even the hail lash the drench mare so cruelli that she
went along sidewai shake her head and ear but levin wa all right
under hi hood and he look cheerfulli about him at the muddi stream
run under the wheel at the drop hang on everi bare twig at
the white of the patch of unmelt hailston on the plank of the
bridg at the thick layer of still juici fleshi leav that lai
heap up about the strip elmtre in spite of the gloomi of
natur around him he felt peculiarli eager the talk he had been
have with the peasant in the further villag had shown that thei
were begin to get us to their new posit the old servant to
whose hut he had gone to get dry evid approv of levin plan
and of hi own accord propos to enter the partnership by the purchas

end thought levin and it someth to work and take troubl for
thi is not a matter of myself individu the question of the public
welfar come into it the whole system of cultur the chief element
in the condit of the peopl must be complet transform instead
of poverti gener prosper and content instead of hostil
harmoni and uniti of interest in short a bloodless revolut but a
revolut of the greatest magnitud begin in the littl circl of
our district then the provinc then russia the whole world becaus
a just idea cannot but be fruit ye it an aim worth work for
and it be me kostya levin who went to a ball in a black tie and
wa refus by the shtcherbatskaya girl and who wa intrins such
a piti worthless creaturethat prove noth i feel sure franklin
felt just as worthless and he too had no faith in himself think of
himself as a whole that mean noth and he too most like had an
agafea mihalovna to whom he confid hi secret
muse on such thought levin reach home in the dark
the bailiff who had been to the merchant had come back and brought
part of the monei for the wheat an agreement had been made with the
old servant and on the road the bailiff had learn that everywher
the corn wa still stand in the field so that hi on hundr and
sixti shock that had not been carri were noth in comparison with
the loss of other
after dinner levin wa sit as he usual did in an easi chair
with a book and as he read he went on think of the journei befor
him in connect with hi book todai all the signific of hi book
rose befor him with special distinct and whole period rang
themselv in hi mind in illustr of hi theori i must write
that down he thought that ought to form a brief introduct which
i thought unnecessari befor he got up to go to hi writingt
and laska ly at hi feet got up too stretch and look at him
as though to inquir where to go but he had not time to write it down
for the head peasant had come round and levin went out into the hall
to them
after hi leve that is to sai give direct about the labor of
the next dai and see all the peasant who had busi with him
levin went back to hi studi and sat down to work
laska lai under the tabl agafea mihalovna settl herself in her
place with her stock

except vivid of kitti her refus and their last meet he
got up and began walk about the room

peasant why as ti theyr sai your master will be get
some honor from the tsar for it inde and it is a strang thing why
need you worri about the peasant

agafea mihalovna knew everi detail of levin plan for hi land levin
often put hi view befor her in all their complex and not
uncommonli he argu with her and did not agre with her comment but
on thi occas she entir misinterpret what he had said
of on soul salvat we all know and must think befor all els
she said with a sigh parfen denisitch now for all he wa no scholar
he di a death that god grant everyon of us the like she said

all
that not what i mean said he i mean that im act for my own
advantag it all the better for me if the peasant do their work

agafea mihalovna allus to the veri subject he had onli just been
think about hurt and stung him levin scowl and without
answer her he sat down again to hi work repeat to himself all
that he had been think of the real signific of that work onli
at interv he listen in the still to the click of agafea
mihalovna needl and recollect what he did not want to rememb
he frown again

carriag over the mud

chapter 31
run halfwai down the staircas levin caught a sound he knew a
familiar cough in the hall but he heard it indistinctli through the
sound of hi own footstep and hope he wa mistaken then he caught
sight of a long boni familiar figur and now it seem there wa no
possibl of mistak and yet he still went on hope that thi tall
man take off hi fur cloak and cough wa not hi brother nikolai
levin love hi brother but be with him wa alwai a tortur just
now when levin under the influenc of the thought that had come to
him and agafea mihalovna hint wa in a troubl and uncertain
humor the meet with hi brother that he had to face seem
particularli difficult instead of a live healthi visitor some
outsid who would he hope cheer him up in hi uncertain humor he
had to see hi brother who knew him through and through who would
call forth all the thought nearest hi heart would forc him to show
himself fulli and that he wa not dispos to do
angri with himself for so base a feel levin ran into the hall as
soon as he had seen hi brother close thi feel of selfish
disappoint vanish instantli and wa replac by piti terribl as
hi brother nikolai had been befor in hi emaci and sickli
now he look still more emaci still more wast he wa a
skeleton cover with skin
he stood in the hall jerk hi long thin neck and pull the scarf
off it and smile a strang and piti smile when he saw that smile
submiss and humbl levin felt someth clutch at hi throat
you see iv come to you said nikolai in a thick voic never for
on second take hi ey off hi brother face iv been mean
to a long while but iv been unwel all the time now im ever so
much better he said rub hi beard with hi big thin hand
ye ye answer levin and he felt still more frighten when
kiss him he felt with hi lip the dryness of hi brother skin
and saw close to him hi big ey full of a strang light
a few week befor konstantin levin had written to hi brother that
through the sale of the small part of the properti that had remain
undivid there wa a sum of about two thousand roubl to come to him
as hi share
nikolai said that he had come now to take thi monei and what wa more
import to stai a while in the old nest to get in touch with the
earth so as to renew hi strength like the hero of old for the work
that lai befor him in spite of hi exagger stoop and the
emaci that wa so strike from hi height hi movement were as
rapid and abrupt as ever levin led him into hi studi
hi brother dress with particular carea thing he never us to
docomb hi scanti lank hair and smile went upstair
he wa in the most affection and goodhumor mood just as levin
often rememb him in childhood he even refer to sergei
ivanovitch without rancor when he saw agafea mihalovna he made joke
with her and ask after the old servant the new of the death of
parfen denisitch made a pain impress on him a look of fear
cross hi face but he regain hi seren immedi
of cours he wa quit old he said and chang the subject well
ill spend a month or two with you and then im off to moscow do you
know myakov ha promis me a place there and im go into the
servic now im go to arrang my life quit differ he went
on you know i got rid of that woman
marya nikolaevna why what for
oh she wa a horrid woman she caus me all sort of worri but
he did not sai what the annoy were he could not sai that he had
cast off marya nikolaevna becaus the tea wa weak and abov all
becaus she would look after him as though he were an invalid
besid i want to turn over a new leaf complet now iv done
silli thing of cours like everyon els but monei the last
consider i dont regret it so long as there health and my
health thank god is quit restor
levin listen and rack hi brain but could think of noth to
sai nikolai probabl felt the same he began question hi brother
about hi affair and levin wa glad to talk about himself becaus
then he could speak without hypocrisi he told hi brother of hi plan
and hi do
hi brother listen but evid he wa not interest by it
these two men were so akin so near each other that the slightest
gestur the tone of voic told both more than could be said in word
both of them now had onli on thoughtth ill of nikolai and the
near of hi deathwhich stifl all els but neither of them dare
to speak of it and so whatev thei saidnot utter the on thought
that fill their mindswa all falsehood never had levin been so glad
when the even wa over and it wa time to go to bed never with ani
outsid person never on ani offici visit had he been so unnatur
and fals as he wa that even and the conscious of thi
unnatur and the remors he felt at it made him even more
unnatur he want to weep over hi dy dearli love brother and
he had to listen and keep on talk of how he meant to live
as the hous wa damp and onli on bedroom had been kept heat levin
put hi brother to sleep in hi own bedroom behind a screen
hi brother got into bed and whether he slept or did not sleep toss
about like a sick man cough and when he could not get hi throat
clear mumbl someth sometim when hi breath wa pain he
said oh my god sometim when he wa choke he mutter angrili
ah the devil levin could not sleep for a long while hear him
hi thought were of the most variou but the end of all hi thought
wa the samedeath death the inevit end of all for the first
time present itself to him with irresist forc and death which
wa here in thi love brother groan half asleep and from habit
call without distinct on god and the devil wa not so remot as
it had hitherto seem to him it wa in himself too he felt that if
not todai tomorrow if not tomorrow in thirti year wasnt it all
the same and what wa thi inevit deathh did not know had never
thought about it and what wa more had not the power had not the
courag to think about it
i work i want to do someth but i had forgotten it must all end i
had forgottendeath
he sat on hi bed in the dark crouch up hug hi knee and
hold hi breath from the strain of thought he ponder but the
more intens he thought the clearer it becam to him that it wa
indubit so that in realiti look upon life he had forgotten
on littl factthat death will come and all end that noth wa
even worth begin and that there wa no help it anywai ye it
wa aw but it wa so
but i am aliv still now what to be done what to be done he
said in despair he light a candl got up cautious and went to the
lookingglass and began look at hi face and hair ye there were
grai hair about hi templ he open hi mouth hi back teeth were
begin to decai he bare hi muscular arm ye there wa strength
in them but nikolai who lai there breath with what wa left of
lung had had a strong healthi bodi too and suddenli he recal how
thei us to go to bed togeth as children and how thei onli wait
till fyodor bogdanitch wa out of the room to fling pillow at each
other and laugh laugh irrepress so that even their aw of fyodor
bogdanitch could not check the effervesc overbrim sens of life
and happi and now that bent hollow chest and i not know
what will becom of me or wherefor
kha kha damnat why do you keep fidget why dont you go
to sleep hi brother voic call to him
oh i dont know im not sleepi
i have had a good sleep im not in a sweat now just see feel my
shirt it not wet is it
levin felt withdrew behind the screen and put out the candl but for
a long while he could not sleep the question how to live had hardli
begun to grow a littl clearer to him when a new insolubl question
present itselfdeath
why he dyingy hell die in the spring and how help him what
can i sai to him what do i know about it id even forgotten that it
wa at all
chapter 32
levin had long befor made the observ that when on is
uncomfort with peopl from their be excess amen and
meek on is apt veri soon after to find thing intoler from their
touchi and irrit he felt that thi wa how it would be with
hi brother and hi brother nikolai gentl did in fact not last
out for long the veri next morn he began to be irrit and
seem do hi best to find fault with hi brother attack him on
hi tenderest point
levin felt himself to blame and could not set thing right he felt
that if thei had both not kept up appear but had spoken as it is
call from the heartthat is to sai had said onli just what thei
were think and feelingthei would simpli have look into each
other face and konstantin could onli have said your dy
your dy and nikolai could onli have answer i know im dy
but im afraid im afraid im afraid and thei could have said
noth more if thei had said onli what wa in their heart but life
like that wa imposs and so konstantin tri to do what he had
been try to do all hi life and never could learn to do though as
far as he could observ mani peopl knew so well how to do it and
without it there wa no live at all he tri to sai what he wa not
think but he felt continu that it had a ring of falsehood that
hi brother detect him in it and wa exasper at it
the third dai nikolai induc hi brother to explain hi plan to him
again and began not mere attack it but intention confound
it with commun
youv simpli borrow an idea that not your own but youv
distort it and ar try to appli it where it not applic
but i tell you it noth to do with it thei deni the justic of
properti of capit of inherit while i do not deni thi chief
stimulu levin felt disgust himself at us such express but
ever sinc he had been engross by hi work he had unconsci come
more and more frequent to us word not russian all i want is to
regul labor
which mean youv borrow an idea strip it of all that gave it
it forc and want to make believ that it someth new said
nikolai angrili tug at hi neckti
but my idea ha noth in common
that anywai said nikolai levin with an iron smile hi ey
flash malignantli ha the charm ofwhat on to call
itgeometr symmetri of clear of definit it mai be a
utopia but if onc on allow the possibl of make of all the
past a tabula rasano properti no familythen labor would organ
itself but you gain noth
why do you mix thing up iv never been a communist
but i have and i consid it prematur but ration and it ha a
futur just like christian in it first ag
all that i maintain is that the labor forc ought to be investig
from the point of view of natur scienc that is to sai it ought to
be studi it qualiti ascertain
but that utter wast of time that forc find a certain form of
activ of itself accord to the stage of it develop there
have been slave first everywher then metay and we have the
halfcrop system rent and dai labor what ar you try to find
levin suddenli lost hi temper at these word becaus at the bottom of
hi heart he wa afraid that it wa truetru that he wa try to
hold the balanc even between commun and the familiar form and
that thi wa hardli possibl
i am try to find mean of work product for myself and for
the labor i want to organ he answer hotli
you dont want to organ anyth it simpli just as youv been
all your life that you want to be origin to pose as not exploit
the peasant simpli but with some idea in view
oh all right that what you thinkand let me alon answer
levin feel the muscl of hi left cheek twitch uncontrol
youv never had and never have convict all you want is to
pleas your vaniti
oh veri well then let me alon
and i will let you alon and it high time i did and go to the
devil with you and im veri sorri i ever came
in spite of all levin effort to sooth hi brother afterward
nikolai would listen to noth he said declar that it wa better
to part and konstantin saw that it simpli wa that life wa unbear
to him
nikolai wa just get readi to go when konstantin went in to him
again and beg him rather unnatur to forgiv him if he had hurt
hi feel in ani wai
ah generos said nikolai and he smile if you want to be
right i can give you that satisfact your in the right but im
go all the same
it wa onli just at part that nikolai kiss him and said look
with sudden strang and serious at hi brother
anywai dont rememb evil against me kostya and hi voic
quiver these were the onli word that had been spoken sincer
between them levin knew that those word meant you see and you
know that im in a bad wai and mayb we shall not see each other
again levin knew thi and the tear gush from hi ey he kiss
hi brother onc more but he could not speak and knew not what to
sai
three dai after hi brother departur levin too set off for hi
foreign tour happen to meet shtcherbatski kitti cousin in the
railwai train levin greatli astonish him by hi depress
what the matter with you shtcherbatski ask him
oh noth there not much happi in life
not much you come with me to pari instead of to mulhausen you shall
see how to be happi
no iv done with it all it time i wa dead
well that a good on said shtcherbatski laugh why im onli
just get readi to begin
ye i thought the same not long ago but now i know i shall soon be
dead
levin said what he had genuin been think of late he saw noth
but death or the advanc toward death in everyth but hi cherish
scheme onli engross him the more life had to be got through somehow
till death did come dark had fallen upon everyth for him but
just becaus of thi dark he felt that the on guid clue in the
dark wa hi work and he clutch it and clung to it with all hi
strength

such grand personagesthat wa how he came to be put in charg of the
princ but he felt hi duti veri irksom the princ wa anxiou to
miss noth of which he would be ask at home had he seen that in
russia and on hi own account he wa anxiou to enjoi to the utmost
all russian form of amus vronski wa oblig to be hi guid in
satisfi both these inclin the morn thei spent drive to
look at place of interest the even thei pass enjoi the
nation entertain the princ rejoic in health except even
among princ by gymnast and care attent to hi health he had
brought himself to such a point that in spite of hi excess in pleasur
he look as fresh as a big glossi green dutch cucumb the princ had
travel a great deal and consid on of the chief advantag of
modern facil of commun wa the access of the
pleasur of all nation
he had been in spain and there had indulg in serenad and had made
friend with a spanish girl who plai the mandolin in switzerland he
had kill chamoi in england he had gallop in a red coat over
hedg and kill two hundr pheasant for a bet in turkei he had got
into a harem in india he had hunt on an eleph and now in russia
he wish to tast all the special russian form of pleasur
vronski who wa as it were chief master of the ceremoni to him
wa at great pain to arrang all the russian amus suggest by
variou person to the princ thei had race hors and russian
pancak and bear hunt and threehors sledg and gypsi and
drink feast with the russian accompani of broken crockeri and
the princ with surpris eas fell in with the russian spirit
smash trai full of crockeri sat with a gypsi girl on hi knee and
seem to be askingwhat more and doe the whole russian spirit
consist in just thi
in realiti of all the russian entertain the princ like best
french actress and ballet dancer and whites champagn vronski
wa us to princ but either becaus he had himself chang of

danger madman afraid of the madman and at the same time from
be with him fear for hi own reason vronski wa continu
consciou of the necess of never for a second relax the tone of

the princ manner of treat the veri peopl who to vronski
surpris were readi to descend to ani depth to provid him with
russian amus wa contemptu hi critic of russian women
whom he wish to studi more than onc made vronski crimson with
indign the chief reason why the princ wa so particularli
disagre to vronski wa that he could not help see himself in

wa a veri stupid and veri selfsatisfi and veri healthi and veri
wellwash man and noth els he wa a gentlemanthat wa true
and vronski could not deni it he wa equabl and not cring with hi

saw him the veri instant he walk into the room she had been
expect him she wa delight and so confus at her own delight
that there wa a moment the moment when he went up to her sister and
glanc again at her when she and he and dolli who saw it all
thought she would break down and would begin to cry she crimson
turn white crimson again and grew faint wait with quiver
lip for him to come to her he went up to her bow and held out hi
hand without speak except for the slight quiver of her lip and the
moistur in her ey that made them brighter her smile wa almost calm

the direct of the diningroom
the men went into the diningroom and went up to a tabl laid with six
sort of spirit and as mani kind of chees some with littl silver
spade and some without caviar her preserv of variou kind
and plate with slice of french bread
the men stood round the strongsmel spirit and salt delicaci

karenin and pestsov di down in anticip of dinner
sergei ivanovitch wa unequ in hi skill in wind up the most
heat and seriou argument by some unexpect pinch of attic salt that
chang the disposit of hi oppon he did thi now
alexei alexandrovitch had been maintain that the russif of
poland could onli be accomplish as a result of larger measur which
ought to be introduc by the russian govern
pestsov insist that on countri can onli absorb anoth when it is
the more dens popul
koznishev admit both point but with limit as thei were

smile

the wineglass with a special sort of spirit the convers drop
at the jest

hous why have you been go in for gymnast again he ask
levin pinch hi muscl with hi left hand levin smile bent hi
arm and under stepan arkadyevitch finger the muscl swell up
like a sound chees hard as a knob of iron through the fine cloth of
the coat
what bicep a perfect samson
i imagin great strength is need for hunt bear observ alexei
alexandrovitch who had the mistiest notion about the chase he cut
off and spread with chees a wafer of bread fine as a spiderweb
levin smile

with a slight bow move asid for the ladi who were approach the
tabl

there that i met your beaufrr in the train or your beaufrr
brotherinlaw he said with a smile it wa an amus meet
and he began tell with droll goodhumor how after not sleep all
night he had wear an old furlin fullskirt coat got into
alexei alexandrovitch compart
the conductor forget the proverb would have chuck me out on
account of my attir but thereupon i began express my feel in
elev languag and you too he said address karenin and
forget hi name at first would have eject me on the ground of
the old coat but afterward you took my part for which i am extrem
grate
the right of passeng gener to choos their seat ar too
illdefin said alexei alexandrovitch rub the tip of hi
finger on hi handkerchief
i saw you were in uncertainti about me said levin smile
goodnaturedli but i made hast to plung into intellectu
convers to smooth over the defect of my attir sergei
ivanovitch while he kept up a convers with their hostess had on
ear for hi brother and he glanc askanc at him what is the matter
with him todai why such a conquer hero he thought he did not
know that levin wa feel as though he had grown wing levin knew
she wa listen to hi word and that she wa glad to listen to him
and thi wa the onli thing that interest him not in that room onli
but in the whole world there exist for him onli himself with
enorm increas import and digniti in hi own ey and she
he felt himself on a pinnacl that made him giddi and far awai down
below were all those nice excel karenin oblonski and all the
world
quit without attract notic without glanc at them as though
there were no other place left stepan arkadyevitch put levin and
kitti side by side
oh you mai as well sit there he said to levin
the dinner wa as choic as the china in which stepan arkadyevitch wa
a connoisseur the soup marielouis wa a splendid success the
tini pi eaten with it melt in the mouth and were irreproach
the two footmen and matvei in white cravat did their duti with the
dish and wine unobtrus quietli and swiftli on the materi
side the dinner wa a success it wa no less so on the immateri the
convers at time gener and at time between individu never
paus and toward the end the compani wa so live that the men rose
from the tabl without stop speak and even alexei
alexandrovitch thaw
chapter 10
pestsov like thrash an argument out to the end and wa not
satisfi with sergei ivanovitch word especi as he felt the
injustic of hi view
i did not mean he said over the soup address alexei
alexandrovitch mere densiti of popul alon but in conjunct
with fundament idea and not by mean of principl
it seem to me alexei alexandrovitch said languidli and with no
hast that that the same thing in my opinion influenc over
anoth peopl is onli possibl to the peopl which ha the higher
develop which
but that just the question pestsov broke in in hi bass he wa
alwai in a hurri to speak and seem alwai to put hi whole soul
into what he wa sai in what ar we to make higher develop
consist the english the french the german which is at the highest
stage of develop which of them will nation the other we see
the rhine provinc have been turn french but the german ar not at
a lower stage he shout there is anoth law at work there
i fanci that the greater influenc is alwai on the side of true
civil said alexei alexandrovitch slightli lift hi
eyebrow
but what ar we to lai down as the outward sign of true
civil said pestsov
i imagin such sign ar gener veri well known said alexei
alexandrovitch
but ar thei fulli known sergei ivanovitch put in with a subtl
smile it is the accept view now that real cultur must be pure
classic but we see most intens disput on each side of the
question and there is no deni that the opposit camp ha strong
point in it favor
you ar for classic sergei ivanovitch will you take red wine said
stepan arkadyevitch
i am not express my own opinion of either form of cultur sergei
ivanovitch said hold out hi glass with a smile of condescens
as to a child i onli sai that both side have strong argument to
support them he went on address alexei alexandrovitch my
sympathi ar classic from educ but in thi discuss i am
person unabl to arriv at a conclus i see no distinct ground
for classic studi be given a preemin over scientif
studi
the natur scienc have just as great an educ valu put in
pestsov take astronomi take botani or zoologi with it system of
gener principl
i cannot quit agre with that respond alexei alexandrovitch it
seem to me that on must admit that the veri process of studi the
form of languag ha a peculiarli favor influenc on intellectu
develop moreov it cannot be deni that the influenc of the
classic author is in the highest degre moral while unfortun
with the studi of the natur scienc ar associ the fals and
noxiou doctrin which ar the curs of our dai
sergei ivanovitch would have said someth but pestsov interrupt
him in hi rich bass he began warmli contest the justic of thi
view sergei ivanovitch wait seren to speak obvious with a
convinc repli readi
but said sergei ivanovitch smile subtli and address karenin
on must allow that to weigh all the advantag and disadvantag of
classic and scientif studi is a difficult task and the question
which form of educ wa to be prefer would not have been so
quickli and conclus decid if there had not been in favor of
classic educ as you express it just now it moraldison le
motantinihilist influenc
undoubtedli
if it had not been for the distinct properti of antinihilist
influenc on the side of classic studi we should have consid
the subject more have weigh the argument on both side said
sergei ivanovitch with a subtl smile we should have given elbowroom
to both tendenc but now we know that these littl pill of
classic learn possess the medicin properti of antinihil and
we boldli prescrib them to our patient but what if thei had no
such medicin properti he wound up humor
at sergei ivanovitch littl pill everyon laugh turovtsin in
especi roar loudli and jovial glad at last to have found
someth to laugh at all he ever look for in listen to
convers
stepan arkadyevitch had not made a mistak in invit pestsov with
pestsov intellectu convers never flag for an instant
directli sergei ivanovitch had conclud the convers with hi
jest pestsov promptli start a new on
i cant agre even said he that the govern had that aim the
govern obvious is guid by abstract consider and remain
indiffer to the influenc it measur mai exercis the educ
of women for instanc would natur be regard as like to be
harm but the govern open school and univers for women
and the convers at onc pass to the new subject of the educ
of women
alexei alexandrovitch express the idea that the educ of women is
apt to be confound with the emancip of women and that it is
onli so that it can be consid danger
i consid on the contrari that the two question ar insepar
connect togeth said pestsov it is a viciou circl woman is
depriv of right from lack of educ and the lack of educ
result from the absenc of right we must not forget that the
subject of women is so complet and date from such ag back that
we ar often unwil to recogn the gulf that separ them from
us said he
you said right said sergei ivanovitch wait till pestsov had
finish mean the right of sit on juri of vote of
presid at offici meet the right of enter the civil
servic of sit in parliament
undoubtedli
but if women as a rare except can occupi such posit it seem
to me you ar wrong in us the express right it would be more
correct to sai duti everi man will agre that in do the duti of a
juryman a wit a telegraph clerk we feel we ar perform
duti and therefor it would be correct to sai that women ar seek
duti and quit legitim and on can but sympath with thi
desir to assist in the gener labor of man
quit so alexei alexandrovitch assent the question i imagin
is simpli whether thei ar fit for such duti
thei will most like be perfectli fit said stepan arkadyevitch
when educ ha becom gener among them we see thi
how about the proverb said the princ who had a long while been
intent on the convers hi littl comic ey twinkl i can
sai it befor my daughter her hair is long becaus her wit is
just what thei thought of the negro befor their emancip said
pestsov angrili
what seem strang to me is that women should seek fresh duti said
sergei ivanovitch while we see unhappili that men usual try to
avoid them
duti ar bound up with rightspow monei honor those ar what
women ar seek said pestsov
just as though i should seek the right to be a wetnurs and feel
injur becaus women ar paid for the work while no on will take
me said the old princ
turovtsin explod in a loud roar of laughter and sergei ivanovitch
regret that he had not made thi comparison even alexei
alexandrovitch smile
ye but a man cant nurs a babi said pestsov while a woman
no there wa an englishman who did suckl hi babi on board ship
said the old princ feel thi freedom in convers permiss
befor hi own daughter
there ar as mani such englishmen as there would be women offici
said sergei ivanovitch
ye but what is a girl to do who ha no famili put in stepan
arkadyevitch think of masha tchibisova whom he had had in hi mind
all along in sympath with pestsov and support him
if the stori of such a girl were thoroughli sift you would find she
had abandon a familyh own or a sister where she might have
found a woman duti darya alexandrovna broke in unexpectedli in a
tone of exasper probabl suspect what sort of girl stepan
arkadyevitch wa think of
but we take our stand on principl as the ideal repli pestsov in
hi mellow bass woman desir to have right to be independ
educ she is oppress humili by the conscious of her
disabl
and im oppress and humili that thei wont engag me at the
foundl the old princ said again to the huge delight of
turovtsin who in hi mirth drop hi asparagu with the thick end in
the sauc
chapter 11
everyon took part in the convers except kitti and levin at
first when thei were talk of the influenc that on peopl ha on
anoth there rose to levin mind what he had to sai on the subject
but these idea onc of such import in hi ey seem to come
into hi brain as in a dream and had now not the slightest interest
for him it even struck him as strang that thei should be so eager to
talk of what wa of no us to anyon kitti too should on would
have suppos have been interest in what thei were sai of the
right and educ of women how often she had muse on the subject
think of her friend abroad varenka of her pain state of
depend how often she had wonder about herself what would becom
of her if she did not marri and how often she had argu with her
sister about it but it did not interest her at all she and levin had
a convers of their own yet not a convers but some sort of
mysteri commun which brought them everi moment nearer and
stir in both a sens of glad terror befor the unknown into which
thei were enter
at first levin in answer to kitti question how he could have seen
her last year in the carriag told her how he had been come home
from the mow along the highroad and had met her
it wa veri veri earli in the morn you were probabl onli just

shake chest

confid smile all dolli children had scarlet fever and he

he felt so sorri for her that he stai and began to help her look
after the children ye and for three week he stop with them and
look after the children like a nurs

him levin glanc onc more at turovtsin and wonder how it wa he
had not realiz all thi man good befor
im sorri im sorri and ill never think ill of peopl again he
said gaili genuin express what he felt at the moment
chapter 12
connect with the convers that had sprung up on the right of
women there were certain question as to the inequ of right in
marriag improp to discuss befor the ladi pestsov had sever
time dure dinner touch upon these question but sergei ivanovitch
and stepan arkadyevitch carefulli drew him off them
when thei rose from the tabl and the ladi had gone out pestsov did
not follow them but address alexei alexandrovitch began to expound
the chief ground of inequ the inequ in marriag in hi
opinion lai in the fact that the infidel of the wife and the
infidel of the husband ar punish unequ both by the law and
by public opinion stepan arkadyevitch went hurriedli up to alexei
alexandrovitch and offer him a cigar
no i dont smoke alexei alexandrovitch answer calmli and as
though purpos wish to show that he wa not afraid of the subject
he turn to pestsov with a chilli smile
i imagin that such a view ha a foundat in the veri natur of
thing he said and would have gone on to the drawingroom but at
thi point turovtsin broke suddenli and unexpectedli into the
convers address alexei alexandrovitch
you heard perhap about pryatchnikov said turovtsin warm up by
the champagn he had drunk and long wait for an opportun to
break the silenc that had weigh on him vasya pryatchnikov he
said with a goodnatur smile on hi damp red lip address
himself princip to the most import guest alexei alexandrovitch
thei told me todai he fought a duel with kvitski at tver and ha
kill him
just as it alwai seem that on bruis oneself on a sore place so
stepan arkadyevitch felt now that the convers would by ill luck
fall everi moment on alexei alexandrovitch sore spot he would again
have got hi brotherinlaw awai but alexei alexandrovitch himself
inquir with curios
what did pryatchnikov fight about
hi wife act like a man he did call him out and shot him
ah said alexei alexandrovitch indiffer and lift hi
eyebrow he went into the drawingroom
how glad i am you have come dolli said with a frighten smile
meet him in the outer drawingroom i must talk to you let sit
here
alexei alexandrovitch with the same express of indiffer given
him by hi lift eyebrow sat down besid darya alexandrovna and
smile affectedli

excus me and to be take leav i have to start tomorrow
darya alexandrovna wa firmli convinc of anna innoc and she
felt herself grow pale and her lip quiver with anger at thi
frigid unfeel man who wa so calmli intend to ruin her innoc
friend
alexei alexandrovitch she said with desper resolut look
him in the face i ask you about anna you made me no answer how is
she

alexandrovitch not look at her
alexei alexandrovitch forgiv me i have no right but i love anna
as a sister and esteem her i beg i beseech you to tell me what is

alexei alexandrovitch frown and almost close hi ey drop hi
head
i presum that your husband ha told you the ground on which i
consid it necessari to chang my attitud to anna arkadyevna he

shtcherbatski who wa walk across the drawingroom

dolli put her hand to her templ and close her ey
alexei alexandrovitch smile coldli with hi lip alon mean to
signifi to her and to himself the firm of hi convict but thi
warm defens though it could not shake him reopen hi wound he
began to speak with greater heat
it is extrem difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself inform
her husband of the factinform him that eight year of her life and a
son all that a mistak and that she want to begin life again he
said angrili with a snort
anna and sini cannot connect them i cannot believ it

of the humili posit in which on is place on cant live
troi
i understand i quit understand that said dolli and her head sank
she wa silent for a littl think of herself of her own grief in
her famili and all at onc with an impuls movement she rais her
head and clasp her hand with an implor gestur but wait a
littl you ar a christian think of her what will becom of her if

alexei alexandrovitch heard her but her word had no effect on him
now all the hatr of that dai when he had resolv on a divorc had
sprung up again in hi soul he shook himself and said in a shrill
loud voic
forgiv i cannot and do not wish to and i regard it as wrong i have

quietli took leav and went awai
chapter 13
when thei rose from tabl levin would have like to follow kitti into
the drawingroom but he wa afraid she might dislik thi as too
obvious pai her attent he remain in the littl ring of men
take part in the gener convers and without look at kitti
he wa awar of her movement her look and the place where she wa
in the drawingroom
he did at onc and without the smallest effort keep the promis he
had made heralwai to think well of all men and to like everyon
alwai the convers fell on the villag commun in which pestsov
saw a sort of special principl call by him the choral principl
levin did not agre with pestsov nor with hi brother who had a
special attitud of hi own both admit and not admit the
signific of the russian commun but he talk to them simpli
try to reconcil and soften their differ he wa not in the
least interest in what he said himself and even less so in what thei
said all he want wa that thei and everyon should be happi and
content he knew now the on thing of import and that on thing
wa at first there in the drawingroom and then began move across
and came to a standstil at the door without turn round he felt the
ey fix on him and the smile and he could not help turn round
she wa stand in the doorwai with shtcherbatski look at him
i thought you were go toward the piano said he go up to her
that someth i miss in the countrymus
no we onli came to fetch you and thank you she said reward him
with a smile that wa like a gift for come what do thei want to
argu for no on ever convinc anyon you know
ye that true said levin it gener happen that on argu
warmli simpli becaus on cant make out what on oppon want to
prove
levin had often notic in discuss between the most intellig
peopl that after enorm effort and an enorm expenditur of
logic subtleti and word the disput final arriv at be
awar that what thei had so long been struggl to prove to on
anoth had long ago from the begin of the argument been known to
both but that thei like differ thing and would not defin what
thei like for fear of it be attack he had often had the
experi of suddenli in a discuss grasp what it wa hi
oppon like and at onc like it too and immedi he found
himself agre and then all argument fell awai as useless
sometim too he had experienc the opposit express at last
what he like himself which he wa devis argument to defend and
chanc to express it well and genuin he had found hi oppon at
onc agre and ceas to disput hi posit he tri to sai
thi
she knit her brow try to understand but directli he began to
illustr hi mean she understood at onc
i know on must find out what he is argu for what is preciou to
him then on can
she had complet guess and express hi badli express idea
levin smile joyfulli he wa struck by thi transit from the
confus verbos discuss with pestsov and hi brother to thi
lacon clear almost wordless commun of the most complex
idea
shtcherbatski move awai from them and kitti go up to a
cardtabl sat down and take up the chalk began draw diverg
circl over the new green cloth
thei began again on the subject that had been start at dinnerth
liberti and occup of women levin wa of the opinion of darya
alexandrovna that a girl who did not marri should find a woman duti
in a famili he support thi view by the fact that no famili can get
on without women to help that in everi famili poor or rich there ar
and must be nurs either relat or hire
no said kitti blush but look at him all the more boldli with
her truth ey a girl mai be so circumstanc that she cannot live
in the famili without humili while she herself
at the hint he understood her
oh ye he said ye ye yesyour right your right
and he saw all that pestsov had been maintain at dinner of the
liberti of woman simpli from get a glimps of the terror of an old
maid exist and it humili in kitti heart and love her
he felt that terror and humili and at onc gave up hi argument
a silenc follow she wa still draw with the chalk on the tabl
her ey were shine with a soft light under the influenc of her
mood he felt in all hi be a continu grow tension of
happi
ah iv scribbl all over the tabl she said and lai down the
chalk she made a movement as though to get up
what shall i be left alonewithout her he thought with horror and
he took the chalk wait a minut he said sit down to the tabl
iv long want to ask you on thing
he look straight into her caress though frighten ey
pleas ask it

might be sincer and he might forgiv her and she might not diethi
mistak wa two month after hi return from moscow brought home to him
in all it signific but the mistak made by him had arisen not
simpli from hi have overlook that conting but also from the
fact that until that dai of hi interview with hi dy wife he had
not known hi own heart at hi sick wife bedsid he had for the
first time in hi life given wai to that feel of sympathet
suffer alwai rous in him by the suffer of other and

stepan arkadyevitch with the same somewhat solemn express with
which he us to take hi presidenti chair at hi board walk into
alexei alexandrovitch room alexei alexandrovitch wa walk about
hi room with hi hand behind hi back think of just what stepan
arkadyevitch had been discuss with hi wife

stepan arkadyevitch with surpris awar of an unaccustom timid
thi feel wa so unexpect and so strang that he did not believ
it wa the voic of conscienc tell him that what he wa mean to

stepan arkadyevitch made an effort and struggl with the timid that
had come over him
i hope you believ in my love for my sister and my sincer affect
and respect for you he said redden
alexei alexandrovitch stood still and said noth but hi face struck
stepan arkadyevitch by it express of an unresist sacrific
i intend i want to have a littl talk with you about my sister
and your mutual posit he said still struggl with an
unaccustom constraint
alexei alexandrovitch smile mournfulli look at hi brotherinlaw

letter and hand it to hi brotherinlaw
i think unceasingli of the same thing and here is what i had begun
write think i could sai it better by letter and that my presenc
irrit her he said as he gave him the letter
stepan arkadyevitch took the letter look with incredul surpris
at the lusterless ey fix so immov on him and began to read

stepan arkadyevitch hand back the letter and with the same surpris
continu look at hi brotherinlaw not know what to sai thi
silenc wa so awkward for both of them that stepan arkadyevitch lip
began twitch nervous while he still gaze without speak at
karenin face
that what i want to sai to her said alexei alexandrovitch
turn awai
ye ye said stepan arkadyevitch not abl to answer for the
tear that were choke him
ye ye i understand you he brought out at last
i want to know what she would like said alexei alexandrovitch
i am afraid she doe not understand her own posit she is not a
judg said stepan arkadyevitch recov himself she is crush
simpli crush by your generos if she were to read thi letter she
would be incap of sai anyth she would onli hang her head
lower than ever
ye but what to be done in that case how explain how find out her
wish
if you will allow me to give my opinion i think that it li with you
to point out directli the step you consid necessari to end the
posit
so you consid it must be end alexei alexandrovitch interrupt
him but how he ad with a gestur of hi hand befor hi ey
not usual with him i see no possibl wai out of it
there is some wai of get out of everi posit said stepan
arkadyevitch stand up and becom more cheer there wa a time
when you thought of break off if you ar convinc now that you
cannot make each other happi
happi mai be various understood but suppos that i agre to
everyth that i want noth what wai is there of get out of
our posit
if you care to know my opinion said stepan arkadyevitch with the
same smile of soften almondoil tender with which he had been
talk to anna hi kindli smile wa so win that alexei
alexandrovitch feel hi own weak and unconsci swai by
it wa readi to believ what stepan arkadyevitch wa sai
she will never speak out about it but on thing is possibl on
thing she might desir he went on that is the cessat of your
relat and all memori associ with them to my think in
your posit what essenti is the format of a new attitud to
on anoth and that can onli rest on a basi of freedom on both
side
divorc alexei alexandrovitch interrupt in a tone of avers
ye i imagin that divorcey divorc stepan arkadyevitch
repeat redden that is from everi point of view the most
ration cours for marri peopl who find themselv in the posit
you ar in what can be done if marri peopl find that life is
imposs for them togeth that mai alwai happen
alexei alexandrovitch sigh heavili and close hi ey
there onli on point to be consid is either of the parti
desir of form new ti if not it is veri simpl said stepan
arkadyevitch feel more and more free from constraint
alexei alexandrovitch scowl with emot mutter someth to
himself and made no answer all that seem so simpl to stepan
arkadyevitch alexei alexandrovitch had thought over thousand of
time and so far from be simpl it all seem to him utterli
imposs divorc the detail of which he knew by thi time seem
to him now out of the question becaus the sens of hi own digniti
and respect for religion forbad hi take upon himself a fictiti
charg of adulteri and still more suffer hi wife pardon and
belov by him to be caught in the fact and put to public shame
divorc appear to him imposs also on other still more weighti
ground
what would becom of hi son in case of a divorc to leav him with
hi mother wa out of the question the divorc mother would have her
own illegitim famili in which hi posit as a stepson and hi
educ would not be good keep him with him he knew that would be
an act of vengeanc on hi part and that he did not want but apart
from thi what more than all made divorc seem imposs to alexei
alexandrovitch wa that by consent to a divorc he would be
complet ruin anna the sai of darya alexandrovna at moscow
that in decid on a divorc he wa think of himself and not
consid that by thi he would be ruin her irrevoc had sunk
into hi heart and connect thi sai with hi forgiv of her
with hi devot to the children he understood it now in hi own wai
to consent to a divorc to give her her freedom meant in hi thought
to take from himself the last tie that bound him to lifeth children
whom he love and to take from her the last prop that stai her on
the path of right to thrust her down to her ruin if she were
divorc he knew she would join her life to vronski and their tie
would be an illegitim and crimin on sinc a wife by the
interpret of the ecclesiast law could not marri while her
husband wa live she will join him and in a year or two he will
throw her over or she will form a new tie thought alexei
alexandrovitch and i by agre to an unlaw divorc shall be to
blame for her ruin he had thought it all over hundr of time and
wa convinc that a divorc wa not at all simpl as stepan
arkadyevitch had said but wa utterli imposs he did not believ a
singl word stepan arkadyevitch said to him to everi word he had a
thousand object to make but he listen to him feel that hi
word were the express of that mighti brutal forc which control
hi life and to which he would have to submit
the onli question is on what term you agre to give her a divorc
she doe not want anyth doe not dare ask you for anyth she
leav it all to your generos
my god my god what for thought alexei alexandrovitch rememb
the detail of divorc proceed in which the husband took the blame
on himself and with just the same gestur with which vronski had done
the same he hid hi face for shame in hi hand
you ar distress i understand that but if you think it over
whosoev shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other
also and if ani man take awai thy coat let him have thy cloak also
thought alexei alexandrovitch
ye ye he cri in a shrill voic i will take the disgrac on
myself i will give up even my son but but wouldnt it be better
to let it alon still you mai do as you like
and turn awai so that hi brotherinlaw could not see him he sat
down on a chair at the window there wa bitter there wa shame in
hi heart but with bitter and shame he felt joi and emot at the
height of hi own meek
stepan arkadyevitch wa touch he wa silent for a space
alexei alexandrovitch believ me she appreci your generos
he said but it seem it wa the will of god he ad and as he
said it felt how foolish a remark it wa and with difficulti repress
a smile at hi own foolish
alexei alexandrovitch would have made some repli but tear stop
him
thi is an unhappi fatal and on must accept it as such i accept
the calam as an accomplish fact and am do my best to help both
her and you said stepan arkadyevitch
when he went out of hi brotherinlaw room he wa touch but that
did not prevent him from be glad he had successfulli brought the
matter to a conclus for he felt certain alexei alexandrovitch would
not go back on hi word to thi satisfact wa ad the fact that
an idea had just struck him for a riddl turn on hi success
achiev that when the affair wa over he would ask hi wife and
most intim friend he put thi riddl into two or three differ
wai but ill work it out better than that he said to himself with
a smile
chapter 23

pluck out of hi heart though he never ceas struggl with it wa
the regret amount to despair that he had lost her forev that
now have expiat hi sin against the husband he wa bound to
renounc her and never in futur to stand between her with her
repent and her husband he had firmli decid in hi heart but he
could not tear out of hi heart hi regret at the loss of her love he

break into a run he went into her room and without consid
without notic whether there wa anyon in the room or not he flung
hi arm round her and began to cover her face her hand her neck
with kiss
anna had been prepar herself for thi meet had thought what she

longer and therefor decid to divid the trousseau into two
partsa larger and smaller trousseauth princess consent to have the
wed befor lent she determin that she would get the smaller part
of the trousseau all readi now and the larger part should be made
later and she wa much vex with levin becaus he wa incap of

arrang or not the arrang wa the more suitabl as
immedi after the wed the young peopl were to go to the
countri where the more import part of the trousseau would not be
want
levin still continu in the same deliri condit in which it
seem to him that he and hi happi constitut the chief and sole
aim of all exist and that he need not now think or care about
anyth that everyth wa be done and would be done for him by

kitti of stepan arkadyevitch advic that thei should go abroad he
wa much surpris that she did not agre to thi and had some
definit requir of her own in regard to their futur she knew
levin had work he love in the countri she did not as he saw
understand thi work she did not even care to understand it but that
did not prevent her from regard it as a matter of great import
and then she knew their home would be in the countri and she want to
go not abroad where she wa not go to live but to the place where
their home would be thi definit express purpos astonish
levin but sinc he did not care either wai he immedi ask
stepan arkadyevitch as though it were hi duti to go down to the
countri and to arrang everyth there to the best of hi abil with
the tast of which he had so much
but i sai stepan arkadyevitch said to him on dai after he had come
back from the countri where he had got everyth readi for the young
peopl arriv have you a certif of have been at
confess

call me a nihilist but thi wont do you know you must take the
sacrament
when there ar four dai left now
stepan arkadyevitch arrang thi also and levin had to go to
confess to levin as to ani unbeliev who respect the belief of
other it wa exceedingli disagre to be present at and take part
in church ceremoni at thi moment in hi present soften state of
feel sensit to everyth thi inevit act of hypocrisi wa
not mere pain to levin it seem to him utterli imposs now
in the heydai of hi highest glori hi fullest flower he would have
to be a liar or a scoffer he felt incap of be either but
though he repeatedli pli stepan arkadyevitch with question as to the
possibl of obtain a certif without actual commun
stepan arkadyevitch maintain that it wa out of the question
besid what is it to youtwo dai and he an awfulli nice clever
old fellow hell pull the tooth out for you so gentli you wont
notic it
stand at the first litani levin attempt to reviv in himself hi
youth recollect of the intens religi emot he had pass
through between the ag of sixteen and seventeen
but he wa at onc convinc that it wa utterli imposs to him he
attempt to look at it all as an empti custom have no sort of
mean like the custom of pai call but he felt that he could not
do that either levin found himself like the major of hi
contemporari in the vaguest posit in regard to religion believ
he could not and at the same time he had no firm convict that it
wa all wrong and consequ not be abl to believ in the
signific of what he wa do nor to regard it with indiffer as
an empti formal dure the whole period of prepar for the
sacrament he wa consciou of a feel of discomfort and shame at
do what he did not himself understand and what as an inner voic
told him wa therefor fals and wrong
dure the servic he would first listen to the prayer try to
attach some mean to them not discord with hi own view then
feel that he could not understand and must condemn them he tri
not to listen to them but to attend to the thought observ and
memori which float through hi brain with extrem vivid dure
thi idl time of stand in church
he had stood through the litani the even servic and the midnight
servic and the next dai he got up earlier than usual and without
have tea went at eight oclock in the morn to the church for the
morn servic and the confess
there wa no on in the church but a beggar soldier two old women and
the church offici a young deacon whose long back show in two
distinct halv through hi thin undercassock met him and at onc
go to a littl tabl at the wall read the exhort dure the
read especi at the frequent and rapid repetit of the same
word lord have merci on us which resound with an echo levin
felt that thought wa shut and seal up and that it must not be
touch or stir now or confus would be the result and so
stand behind the deacon he went on think of hi own affair
neither listen nor examin what wa said it wonder what
express there is in her hand he thought rememb how thei had
been sit the dai befor at a corner tabl thei had noth to talk
about as wa almost alwai the case at thi time and lai her hand
on the tabl she kept open and shut it and laugh herself as
she watch her action he rememb how he had kiss it and then had
examin the line on the pink palm have merci on us again thought
levin cross himself bow and look at the suppl spring of
the deacon back bow befor him she took my hand then and
examin the line youv got a splendid hand she said and he
look at hi own hand and the short hand of the deacon ye now it
will soon be over he thought no it seem to be begin again
he thought listen to the prayer no it just end there he
is bow down to the ground that alwai at the end
the deacon hand in a plush cuff accept a threeroubl note
unobtrus and the deacon said he would put it down in the
regist and hi new boot creak jauntili over the flagston of
the empti church he went to the altar a moment later he peep out
thenc and beckon to levin thought till then lock up began to
stir in levin head but he made hast to drive it awai it will come
right somehow he thought and went toward the altarrail he went
up the step and turn to the right saw the priest the priest a
littl old man with a scanti grizzl beard and weari goodnatur
ey wa stand at the altarrail turn over the page of a
missal with a slight bow to levin he began immedi read prayer
in the offici voic when he had finish them he bow down to the
ground and turn face levin
christ is present here unseen receiv your confess he said
point to the crucifix do you believ in all the doctrin of the
holi apostol church the priest went on turn hi ey awai from
levin face and fold hi hand under hi stole
i have doubt i doubt everyth said levin in a voic that jar
on himself and he ceas speak
the priest wait a few second to see if he would not sai more and
close hi ey he said quickli with a broad vladimirski accent
doubt is natur to the weak of mankind but we must prai that god
in hi merci will strengthen us what ar your special sin he ad
without the slightest interv as though anxiou not to wast time
my chief sin is doubt i have doubt of everyth and for the most
part i am in doubt
doubt is natur to the weak of mankind the priest repeat the
same word what do you doubt about princip
i doubt of everyth i sometim even have doubt of the exist
of god levin could not help sai and he wa horrifi at the
improprieti of what he wa sai but levin word did not it
seem make much impress on the priest
what sort of doubt can there be of the exist of god he said
hurriedli with a just percept smile
levin did not speak
what doubt can you have of the creator when you behold hi creation
the priest went on in the rapid customari jargon who ha deck the
heavenli firmament with it light who ha cloth the earth in it
beauti how explain it without the creator he said look
inquiringli at levin
levin felt that it would be improp to enter upon a metaphys
discuss with the priest and so he said in repli mere what wa a
direct answer to the question
i dont know he said
you dont know then how can you doubt that god creat all the
priest said with goodhumor perplex
i dont understand it at all said levin blush and feel that
hi word were stupid and that thei could not be anyth but stupid
in such a posit
prai to god and beseech him even the holi father had doubt and
prai to god to strengthen their faith the devil ha great power and
we must resist him prai to god beseech him prai to god he repeat
hurriedli
the priest paus for some time as though medit
your about i hear to marri the daughter of my parishion and son
in the spirit princ shtcherbatski he resum with a smile an
excel young ladi
ye answer levin blush for the priest what doe he want to
ask me about thi at confess for he thought
and as though answer hi thought the priest said to him
you ar about to enter into holi matrimoni and god mai bless you with
offspr well what sort of bringingup can you give your babe if
you do not overcom the temptat of the devil entic you to
infidel he said with gentl reproach if you love your
child as a good father you will not desir onli wealth luxuri honor
for your infant you will be anxiou for hi salvat hi spiritu
enlighten with the light of truth eh what answer will you make
him when the innoc babe ask you papa who made all that enchant
me in thi worldth earth the water the sun the flower the

you sai to him when you know noth how will you answer him will you
leav him to the allur of the world and the devil that not
right he said and he stop put hi head on on side and
look at levin with hi kindli gentl ey
levin made no answer thi time not becaus he did not want to enter
upon a discuss with the priest but becaus so far no on had ever
ask him such question and when hi babe did ask him those

at that meet vronski perceiv that golenishtchev had taken up a
sort of lofti intellectu liber line and wa consequ
dispos to look down upon vronski interest and call in life
henc vronski had met him with the chill and haughti manner he so
well knew how to assum the mean of which wa you mai like or
dislik my wai of life that a matter of the most perfect
indiffer to me you will have to treat me with respect if you want
to know me golenishtchev had been contemptu indiffer to the
tone taken by vronski thi second meet might have been expect
on would have suppos to estrang them still more but now thei

behav in regard to all the complex and insolubl problem with which
life is encompass on all side thei behav with proprieti avoid
allus and unpleas question thei assum an air of fulli
comprehend the import and forc of the situat of accept and
even approv of it but of consid it superflu and uncal
for to put all thi into word
vronski at onc divin that golenishtchev wa of thi class and
therefor wa doubli pleas to see him and in fact golenishtchev
manner to madam karenina when he wa taken to call on her wa all
that vronski could have desir obvious without the slightest effort
he steer clear of all subject which might lead to embarrass
he had never met anna befor and wa struck by her beauti and still
more by the frank with which she accept her posit she blush
when vronski brought in golenishtchev and he wa extrem charm by
thi childish blush overspread her candid and handsom face but
what he like particularli wa the wai in which at onc as though on

at vronski and again a vivid flush overspread her face
vronski saw from her ey that she did not know on what term he care
to be with golenishtchev and so wa afraid of not behav as he would
wish
he look a long tender look at her

and it seem to her that she understood everyth most of all that
he wa pleas with her and smile to him she walk with her rapid
step out at the door
the friend glanc at on anoth and a look of hesit came into
both face as though golenishtchev unmistak admir her would
have like to sai someth about her and could not find the right
thing to sai while vronski desir and dread hi do so
well then vronski began to start a convers of some sort so
your settl here your still at the same work then he went on
recal that he had been told golenishtchev wa write someth
ye im write the second part of the two element said
golenishtchev color with pleasur at the questionthat is to be
exact i am not write it yet i am prepar collect materi
it will be of far wider scope and will touch on almost all question
we in russia refus to see that we ar the heir of byzantium and he
launch into a long and heat explan of hi view
vronski at the first moment felt embarrass at not even know of the
first part of the two element of which the author spoke as
someth well known but as golenishtchev began to lai down hi
opinion and vronski wa abl to follow them even without know the
two element he listen to him with some interest for
golenishtchev spoke well but vronski wa startl and annoi by the
nervou irasc with which golenishtchev talk of the subject
that engross him as he went on talk hi ey glitter more and
more angrili he wa more and more hurri in hi repli to imaginari
oppon and hi face grew more and more excit and worri
rememb golenishtchev a thin live goodnatur and wellbr
boi alwai at the head of the class vronski could not make out the
reason of hi irrit and he did not like it what he
particularli dislik wa that golenishtchev a man belong to a good
set should put himself on a level with some scribbl fellow with
whom he wa irrit and angri wa it worth it vronski dislik it
yet he felt that golenishtchev wa unhappi and wa sorri for him
unhappi almost mental derang wa visibl on hi mobil
rather handsom face while without even notic anna come in he
went on hurriedli and hotli express hi view
when anna came in in her hat and cape and her love hand rapidli

the thought of the harm caus to her husband arous in her a feel
like repuls and akin to what a drown man might feel who ha
shaken off anoth man cling to him that man did drown it wa an
evil action of cours but it wa the sole mean of escap and better
not to brood over these fear fact

everythingi am lose my good name and my son i have done wrong and
so i dont want happi i dont want a divorc and shall suffer
from my shame and the separ from my child but howev sincer
anna had meant to suffer she wa not suffer shame there wa not
with the tact of which both had such a larg share thei had succeed
in avoid russian ladi abroad and so had never place themselv
in a fals posit and everywher thei had met peopl who pretend
that thei perfectli understood their posit far better inde than
thei did themselv separ from the son she lovedeven that did
not caus her anguish in these earli dai the babi girlhi
childwa so sweet and had so won anna heart sinc she wa all that

though she were some young girl in love in everyth he said
thought and did she saw someth particularli nobl and elev
her ador of him alarm her inde she sought and could not find
in him anyth not fine she dare not show him her sens of her own
insignific besid him it seem to her that know thi he

no will of hi own and wa anxiou it seem for noth but to
anticip her wish and she could not but appreci thi even
though the veri intens of hi solicitud for her the atmospher of
care with which he surround her sometim weigh upon her
vronski meanwhil in spite of the complet realiz of what he had
so long desir wa not perfectli happi he soon felt that the
realiz of hi desir gave him no more than a grain of sand out of
the mountain of happi he had expect it show him the mistak
men make in pictur to themselv happi as the realiz of
their desir for a time after join hi life to her and put
on civilian dress he had felt all the delight of freedom in gener of
which he had known noth befor and of freedom in hi loveand he
wa content but not for long he wa soon awar that there wa
spring up in hi heart a desir for desiresennui without
consciou intent he began to clutch at everi pass capric take
it for a desir and an object sixteen hour of the dai must be
occupi in some wai sinc thei were live abroad in complet
freedom outsid the condit of social life which fill up time in
petersburg as for the amus of bachelor exist which had
provid vronski with entertain on previou tour abroad thei
could not be thought of sinc the sole attempt of the sort had led to
a sudden attack of depress in anna quit out of proport with the
causea late supper with bachelor friend relat with the societi
of the placeforeign and russianwer equal out of the question ow
to the irregular of their posit the inspect of object of
interest apart from the fact that everyth had been seen alreadi
had not for vronski a russian and a sensibl man the immens
signific englishmen ar abl to attach to that pursuit
and just as the hungri stomach eagerli accept everi object it can get
hope to find nourish in it vronski quit unconsci clutch
first at polit then at new book and then at pictur
as he had from a child a tast for paint and as not know what
to spend hi monei on he had begun collect engrav he came to a
stop at paint began to take interest in it and concentr upon
it the unoccupi mass of desir which demand satisfact
he had a readi appreci of art and probabl with a tast for
imit art he suppos himself to have the real thing essenti for
an artist and after hesit for some time which style of paint
to selectreligi histor realist or genr paintingh set to
work to paint he appreci all kind and could have felt inspir
by anyon of them but he had no concept of the possibl of
know noth at all of ani school of paint and of be inspir
directli by what is within the soul without care whether what is
paint will belong to ani recogn school sinc he knew noth of
thi and drew hi inspir not directli from life but indirectli
from life embodi in art hi inspir came veri quickli and
easili and as quickli and easili came hi success in paint
someth veri similar to the sort of paint he wa try to
imit
more than ani other style he like the frenchgrac and
effectiveand in that style he began to paint anna portrait in
italian costum and the portrait seem to him and to everyon who
saw it extrem success
chapter 9
the old neglect palazzo with it lofti carv ceil and fresco
on the wall with it floor of mosaic with it heavi yellow stuff
curtain on the window with it vase on pedest and it open
fireplac it carv door and gloomi recept room hung with
picturesthi palazzo did much by it veri appear after thei had
move into it to confirm in vronski the agreeabl illus that he wa
not so much a russian countri gentleman a retir armi offic as an
enlighten amateur and patron of the art himself a modest artist who
had renounc the world hi connect and hi ambit for the sake
of the woman he love
the pose chosen by vronski with their remov into the palazzo wa
complet success and have through golenishtchev made
acquaint with a few interest peopl for a time he wa
satisfi he paint studi from natur under the guidanc of an
italian professor of paint and studi mediv italian life
mediv italian life so fascin vronski that he even wore a hat and
flung a cloak over hi shoulder in the mediv style which inde
wa extrem becom to him
here we live and know noth of what go on vronski said to
golenishtchev as he came to see him on morn have you seen
mihailov pictur he said hand him a russian gazett he had
receiv that morn and point to an articl on a russian artist
live in the veri same town and just finish a pictur which had
long been talk about and had been bought beforehand the articl
reproach the govern and the academi for let so remark an
artist be left without encourag and support
iv seen it answer golenishtchev of cours he not without
talent but it all in a wrong direct it all the
ivanovstraussrenan attitud to christ and to religi paint
what is the subject of the pictur ask anna
christ befor pilat christ is repres as a jew with all the
realism of the new school
and the question of the subject of the pictur have brought him to
on of hi favorit theori golenishtchev launch forth into a
disquisit on it
i cant understand how thei can fall into such a gross mistak christ
alwai ha hi definit embodi in the art of the great master and
therefor if thei want to depict not god but a revolutionist or a
sage let them take from histori a socrat a franklin a charlott
cordai but not christ thei take the veri figur which cannot be taken
for their art and then
and is it true that thi mihailov is in such poverti ask vronski
think that as a russian mcena it wa hi duti to assist the
artist regardless of whether the pictur were good or bad
i should sai not he a remark portraitpaint have you ever
seen hi portrait of madam vassiltchikova but i believ he doesnt
care about paint ani more portrait and so veri like he is in
want i maintain that
couldnt we ask him to paint a portrait of anna arkadyevna said
vronski
why mine said anna after your i dont want anoth portrait
better have on of anni so she call her babi girl here she is
she ad look out of the window at the handsom italian nurs who
wa carri the child out into the garden and immedi glanc
unnot at vronski the handsom nurs from whom vronski wa
paint a head for hi pictur wa the on hidden grief in anna
life he paint with her as hi model admir her beauti and
mediv and anna dare not confess to herself that she wa afraid
of becom jealou of thi nurs and wa for that reason particularli
graciou and condescend both to her and her littl son vronski
too glanc out of the window and into anna ey and turn at
onc to golenishtchev he said
do you know thi mihailov
i have met him but he a queer fish and quit without breed you
know on of those uncouth new peopl on so often come across
nowadai on of those freethink you know who ar rear
dembl in theori of atheism sceptic and materi in
former dai said golenishtchev not observ or not will to
observ that both anna and vronski want to speak in former dai
the freethink wa a man who had been brought up in idea of
religion law and moral and onli through conflict and struggl
came to freethought but now there ha sprung up a new type of born
freethink who grow up without even have heard of principl of
moral or of religion of the exist of author who grow up
directli in idea of negat in everyth that is to sai savag
well he of that class he the son it appear of some moscow
butler and ha never had ani sort of bringingup when he got into the
academi and made hi reput he tri as he no fool to educ
himself and he turn to what seem to him the veri sourc of
cultureth magazin in old time you see a man who want to
educ himselfa frenchman for instancewould have set to work to
studi all the classic and theologian and tragedian and historian
and philosoph and you know all the intellectu work that came in
hi wai but in our dai he goe straight for the literatur of
negat veri quickli assimil all the extract of the scienc of
negat and he readi and that not alltwenti year ago he would
have found in that literatur trace of conflict with author with
the creed of the ag he would have perceiv from thi conflict that
there wa someth els but now he come at onc upon a literatur in
which the old creed do not even furnish matter for discuss but it
is state baldli that there is noth elseevolut natur
select struggl for existenceand that all in my articl

profound comprehens than he had himself and alwai expect from
them someth he did not himself see in the pictur and often in
their critic he fanci that he had found thi

excit he wa struck by the soft light on anna figur as she
stood in the shade of the entranc listen to golenishtchev who wa

movement with hi brown hat olivegreen coat and narrow
trousersthough wide trouser had been a long while in fashionmost of
all with the ordinari of hi broad face and the combin

chapter 11
on enter the studio mihailov onc more scan hi visitor and
note down in hi imagin vronski express too and especi
hi jaw although hi artist sens wa unceasingli at work
collect materi although he felt a continu increas
excit as the moment of critic hi work drew nearer he
rapidli and subtli form from impercept sign a mental imag of
these three person
that fellow golenishtchev wa a russian live here mihailov did not
rememb hi surnam nor where he had met him nor what he had said to
him he onli rememb hi face as he rememb all the face he had
ever seen but he rememb too that it wa on of the face laid by
in hi memori in the immens class of the fals consequenti and
poor in express the abund hair and veri open forehead gave an
appear of consequ to the face which had onli on expressiona
petti childish peevish express concentr just abov the bridg
of the narrow nose vronski and madam karenina must be mihailov
suppos distinguish and wealthi russian know noth about
art like all those wealthi russian but pose as amateur and
connoisseur most like theyv alreadi look at all the antiqu
and now theyr make the round of the studio of the new peopl the
german humbug and the crack preraphaelit english fellow and have
onli come to me to make the point of view complet he thought he wa
well acquaint with the wai dilettanti have the clever thei were
the wors he found them of look at the work of contemporari
artist with the sole object of be in a posit to sai that art is
a thing of the past and that the more on see of the new men the more
on see how inimit the work of the great old master have
remain he expect all thi he saw it all in their face he saw it
in the careless indiffer with which thei talk among themselv
stare at the lai figur and bust and walk about in leisur
fashion wait for him to uncov hi pictur but in spite of thi
while he wa turn over hi studi pull up the blind and take
off the sheet he wa in intens excit especi as in spite of
hi convict that all distinguish and wealthi russian were certain
to be beast and fool he like vronski and still more anna
here if you pleas he said move on on side with hi nimbl gait
and point to hi pictur it the exhort to pilat matthew
chapter xxvii he said feel hi lip were begin to trembl
with emot he move awai and stood behind them
for the few second dure which the visitor were gaze at the
pictur in silenc mihailov too gaze at it with the indiffer ey of
an outsid for those few second he wa sure in anticip that a
higher juster critic would be utter by them by those veri
visitor whom he had been so despis a moment befor he forgot all
he had thought about hi pictur befor dure the three year he had
been paint it he forgot all it qualiti which had been absolut
certain to himh saw the pictur with their indiffer new outsid
ey and saw noth good in it he saw in the foreground pilat
irrit face and the seren face of christ and in the background the
figur of pilat retinu and the face of john watch what wa
happen everi face that with such agoni such blunder and
correct had grown up within him with it special charact everi
face that had given him such torment and such raptur and all these
face so mani time transpos for the sake of the harmoni of the
whole all the shade of color and tone that he had attain with such
laboral of thi togeth seem to him now look at it with their
ey the merest vulgar someth that had been done a thousand
time over the face dearest to him the face of christ the center of
the pictur which had given him such ecstasi as it unfold itself to
him wa utterli lost to him when he glanc at the pictur with their
ey he saw a wellpaint no not even thath distinctli saw now a
mass of defect repetit of those endless christ of titian
raphael ruben and the same soldier and pilat it wa all common
poor and stale and posit badli paintedweak and unequ thei
would be justifi in repeat hypocrit civil speech in the
presenc of the painter and piti him and laugh at him when thei
were alon again
the silenc though it last no more than a minut becam too
intoler to him to break it and to show he wa not agit he
made an effort and address golenishtchev
i think iv had the pleasur of meet you he said look
uneasili first at anna then at vronski in fear of lose ani shade of
their express
to be sure we met at rossi do you rememb at that soir when
that italian ladi recitedth new rachel golenishtchev answer
easili remov hi ey without the slightest regret from the pictur
and turn to the artist
notic howev that mihailov wa expect a critic of the
pictur he said
your pictur ha got on a great deal sinc i saw it last time and
what strike me particularli now as it did then is the figur of
pilat on so know the man a goodnatur capit fellow but an
offici through and through who doe not know what it is he do
but i fanci
all mihailov mobil face beam at onc hi ey sparkl he tri
to sai someth but he could not speak for excit and pretend
to be cough low as wa hi opinion of golenishtchev capac for
understand art trifl as wa the true remark upon the fidel of
the express of pilat as an offici and offens as might have
seem the utter of so unimport an observ while noth wa
said of more seriou point mihailov wa in an ecstasi of delight at
thi observ he had himself thought about pilat figur just
what golenishtchev said the fact that thi reflect wa but on of
million of reflect which as mihailov knew for certain would be
true did not diminish for him the signific of golenishtchev
remark hi heart warm to golenishtchev for thi remark and from a
state of depress he suddenli pass to ecstasi at onc the whole of
hi pictur live befor him in all the indescrib complex of
everyth live mihailov again tri to sai that that wa how he
understood pilat but hi lip quiver intract and he could not
pronounc the word vronski and anna too said someth in that
subdu voic in which partli to avoid hurt the artist feel
and partli to avoid sai out loud someth sillyso easili said when
talk of artpeopl usual speak at exhibit of pictur
mihailov fanci that the pictur had made an impress on them too
he went up to them
how marvel christ express is said anna of all she saw she
like that express most of all and she felt that it wa the center
of the pictur and so prais of it would be pleasant to the artist
on can see that he is piti pilat
thi again wa on of the million true reflect that could be found
in hi pictur and in the figur of christ she said that he wa
piti pilat in christ express there ought to be inde an
express of piti sinc there is an express of love of heavenli
peac of readi for death and a sens of the vaniti of word of
cours there is the express of an offici in pilat and of piti in
christ see that on is the incarn of the fleshli and the other
of the spiritu life all thi and much more flash into mihailov
thought
ye and how that figur is donewhat atmospher on can walk round
it said golenishtchev unmistak betrai by thi remark that he
did not approv of the mean and idea of the figur
ye there a wonder masteri said vronski how those figur in
the background stand out there you have techniqu he said
address golenishtchev allud to a convers between them about
vronski despair of attain thi techniqu
ye ye marvel golenishtchev and anna assent in spite of the
excit condit in which he wa the sentenc about techniqu had
sent a pang to mihailov heart and look angrili at vronski he
suddenli scowl he had often heard thi word techniqu and wa
utterli unabl to understand what wa understood by it he knew that by
thi term wa understood a mechan facil for paint or draw
entir apart from it subject he had notic often that even in
actual prais techniqu wa oppos to essenti qualiti as though on
could paint well someth that wa bad he knew that a great deal of
attent and care wa necessari in take off the cover to avoid
injur the creation itself and to take off all the cover but
there wa no art of paintingno techniqu of ani sortabout it if to a
littl child or to hi cook were reveal what he saw it or she would
have been abl to peel the wrap off what wa seen and the most
experienc and adroit painter could not by mere mechan facil
paint anyth if the line of the subject were not reveal to him
first besid he saw that if it came to talk about techniqu it
wa imposs to prais him for it in all he had paint and
repaint he saw fault that hurt hi ey come from want of care in
take off the wrappingsfault he could not correct now without
spoil the whole and in almost all the figur and face he saw
too remnant of the wrap not perfectli remov that spoil the
pictur
on thing might be said if you will allow me to make the remark
observ golenishtchev
oh i shall be delight i beg you said mihailov with a forc
smile
that is that you make him the mangod and not the godman but i
know that wa what you meant to do
i cannot paint a christ that is not in my heart said mihailov
gloomili
ye but in that case if you will allow me to sai what i think
your pictur is so fine that my observ cannot detract from it
and besid it is onli my person opinion with you it is differ
your veri motiv is differ but let us take ivanov i imagin that
if christ is brought down to the level of an histor charact it
would have been better for ivanov to select some other histor
subject fresh untouch
but if thi is the greatest subject present to art
if on look on would find other but the point is that art cannot
suffer doubt and discuss and befor the pictur of ivanov the
question aris for the believ and the unbeliev alik is it god
or is it not god and the uniti of the impress is destroi
why so i think that for educ peopl said mihailov the
question cannot exist
golenishtchev did not agre with thi and confound mihailov by hi
support of hi first idea of the uniti of the impress be
essenti to art
mihailov wa greatli perturb but he could sai noth in defens of
hi own idea
chapter 12
anna and vronski had long been exchang glanc regret their
friend flow of clever at last vronski without wait for the
artist walk awai to anoth small pictur
oh how exquisit what a love thing a gem how exquisit thei
cri with on voic
what is it theyr so pleas with thought mihailov he had
posit forgotten that pictur he had paint three year ago he
had forgotten all the agoni and the ecstasi he had live through
with that pictur when for sever month it had been the on thought
haunt him dai and night he had forgotten as he alwai forgot the
pictur he had finish he did not even like to look at it and had
onli brought it out becaus he wa expect an englishman who want
to bui it
oh that onli an old studi he said
how fine said golenishtchev he too with unmistak sincer
fall under the spell of the pictur
two boi were angl in the shade of a willowtre the elder had just
drop in the hook and wa carefulli pull the float from behind a
bush entir absorb in what he wa do the other a littl
younger wa ly in the grass lean on hi elbow with hi
tangl flaxen head in hi hand stare at the water with hi dreami
blue ey what wa he think of
the enthusiasm over thi pictur stir some of the old feel for it
in mihailov but he fear and dislik thi wast of feel for
thing past and so even though thi prais wa grate to him he
tri to draw hi visitor awai to a third pictur
but vronski ask whether the pictur wa for sale to mihailov at that
moment excit by visitor it wa extrem distast to speak of
monei matter
it is put up there to be sold he answer scowl gloomili
when the visitor had gone mihailov sat down opposit the pictur of
pilat and christ and in hi mind went over what had been said and
what though not said had been impli by those visitor and strang
to sai what had had such weight with him while thei were there and
while he mental put himself at their point of view suddenli lost all
import for him he began to look at hi pictur with all hi own
full artist vision and wa soon in that mood of convict of the
perfect and so of the signific of hi picturea convict
essenti to the most intens fervor exclud all other interestsin
which alon he could work
christ foreshorten leg wa not right though he took hi palett
and began to work as he correct the leg he look continu at the
figur of john in the background which hi visitor had not even
notic but which he knew wa beyond perfect when he had finish
the leg he want to touch that figur but he felt too much excit
for it he wa equal unabl to work when he wa cold and when he wa
too much affect and saw everyth too much there wa onli on stage
in the transit from cold to inspir at which work wa
possibl todai he wa too much agit he would have cover the
pictur but he stop hold the cloth in hi hand and smile
blissfulli gaze a long while at the figur of john at last as it
were regretfulli tear himself awai he drop the cloth and
exhaust but happi went home
vronski anna and golenishtchev on their wai home were particularli
live and cheer thei talk of mihailov and hi pictur the word
talent by which thei meant an inborn almost physic aptitud
apart from brain and heart and in which thei tri to find an
express for all the artist had gain from life recur
particularli often in their talk as though it were necessari for them
to sum up what thei had no concept of though thei want to talk of
it thei said that there wa no deni hi talent but that hi talent
could not develop for want of educationth common defect of our
russian artist but the pictur of the boi had imprint itself on
their memori and thei were continu come back to it what an
exquisit thing how he ha succeed in it and how simpli he doesnt
even comprehend how good it is ye i mustnt let it slip i must bui
it said vronski
chapter 13
mihailov sold vronski hi pictur and agre to paint a portrait of
anna on the dai fix he came and began the work
from the fifth sit the portrait impress everyon especi
vronski not onli by it resembl but by it characterist beauti
it wa strang how mihailov could have discov just her
characterist beauti on need to know and love her as i have love
her to discov the veri sweetest express of her soul vronski
thought though it wa onli from thi portrait that he had himself
learn thi sweetest express of her soul but the express wa so
true that he and other too fanci thei had long known it
i have been struggl on for ever so long without do anyth he
said of hi own portrait of her and he just look and paint it
that where techniqu come in
that will come wa the consol reassur given him by
golenishtchev in whose view vronski had both talent and what wa most
import cultur give him a wider outlook on art golenishtchev
faith in vronski talent wa prop up by hi own need of vronski
sympathi and approv for hi own articl and idea and he felt that
the prais and support must be mutual
in anoth man hous and especi in vronski palazzo mihailov
wa quit a differ man from what he wa in hi studio he behav
with hostil courtesi as though he were afraid of come closer to
peopl he did not respect he call vronski your excel and
notwithstand anna and vronski invit he would never stai
to dinner nor come except for the sit anna wa even more
friendli to him than to other peopl and wa veri grate for her
portrait vronski wa more than cordial with him and wa obvious
interest to know the artist opinion of hi pictur golenishtchev
never let slip an opportun of instil sound idea about art into
mihailov but mihailov remain equal chilli to all of them anna wa
awar from hi ey that he like look at her but he avoid
convers with her vronski talk about hi paint he met with
stubborn silenc and he wa as stubbornli silent when he wa shown
vronski pictur he wa unmistak bore by golenishtchev
convers and he did not attempt to oppos him
altogeth mihailov with hi reserv and disagre as it were
hostil attitud wa quit dislik by them as thei got to know him
better and thei were glad when the sit were over and thei were
left with a magnific portrait in their possess and he gave up
come golenishtchev wa the first to give express to an idea that
had occur to all of them which wa that mihailov wa simpli jealou
of vronski
not enviou let us sai sinc he ha talent but it annoi him that
a wealthi man of the highest societi and a count too you know thei
all detest a titl can without ani particular troubl do as well
if not better than he who ha devot all hi life to it and more
than all it a question of cultur which he is without
vronski defend mihailov but at the bottom of hi heart he believ
it becaus in hi view a man of a differ lower world would be sure
to be enviou
anna portraitth same subject paint from natur both by him and by
mihailovought to have shown vronski the differ between him and
mihailov but he did not see it onli after mihailov portrait wa
paint he left off paint hi portrait of anna decid that it wa
now not need hi pictur of mediv life he went on with and he
himself and golenishtchev and still more anna thought it veri good
becaus it wa far more like the celebr pictur thei knew than
mihailov pictur
mihailov meanwhil although anna portrait greatli fascin him
wa even more glad than thei were when the sit were over and he
had no longer to listen to golenishtchev disquisit upon art and
could forget about vronski paint he knew that vronski could not
be prevent from amus himself with paint he knew that he and
all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what thei like but it wa
distast to him a man could not be prevent from make himself a
big wax doll and kiss it but if the man were to come with the doll
and sit befor a man in love and begin caress hi doll as the lover
caress the woman he love it would be distast to the lover just
such a distast sensat wa what mihailov felt at the sight of
vronski paint he felt it both ludicr and irrit both
pitiabl and offens
vronski interest in paint and the middl ag did not last long
he had enough tast for paint to be unabl to finish hi pictur
the pictur came to a standstil he wa vagu awar that it
defect inconspicu at first would be glare if he were to go on
with it the same experi befel him as golenishtchev who felt that
he had noth to sai and continu deceiv himself with the theori
that hi idea wa not yet matur that he wa work it out and
collect materi thi exasper and tortur golenishtchev but
vronski wa incap of deceiv and tortur himself and even more
incap of exasper with hi characterist decis without
explan or apolog he simpli ceas work at paint
but without thi occup the life of vronski and of anna who
wonder at hi loss of interest in it struck them as intoler
tediou in an italian town the palazzo suddenli seem so obtrus
old and dirti the spot on the curtain the crack in the floor the
broken plaster on the cornic becam so disagre obviou and the
everlast same of golenishtchev and the italian professor and
the german travel becam so wearisom that thei had to make some
chang thei resolv to go to russia to the countri in petersburg
vronski intend to arrang a partit of the land with hi brother
while anna meant to see her son the summer thei intend to spend on
vronski great famili estat
chapter 14
levin had been marri three month he wa happi but not at all in
the wai he had expect to be at everi step he found hi former dream
disappoint and new unexpect surpris of happi he wa happi
but on enter upon famili life he saw at everi step that it wa
utterli differ from what he had imagin at everi step he
experienc what a man would experi who after admir the smooth
happi cours of a littl boat on a lake should get himself into that
littl boat he saw that it wa not all sit still float
smoothli that on had to think too not for an instant to forget where
on wa float and that there wa water under on and that on must
row and that hi unaccustom hand would be sore and that it wa
onli to look at it that wa easi but that do it though veri
delight wa veri difficult
as a bachelor when he had watch other peopl marri life seen
the petti care the squabbl the jealousi he had onli smile
contemptu in hi heart in hi futur marri life there could be
he wa convinc noth of that sort even the extern form
inde he fanci must be utterli unlik the life of other in
everyth and all of a sudden instead of hi life with hi wife
be made on an individu pattern it wa on the contrari entir
made up of the pettiest detail which he had so despis befor but
which now by no will of hi own had gain an extraordinari
import that it wa useless to contend against and levin saw that
the organ of all these detail wa by no mean so easi as he had
fanci befor although levin believ himself to have the most exact
concept of domest life unconsci like all men he pictur
domest life as the happiest enjoy of love with noth to hinder
and no petti care to distract he ought as he conceiv the posit
to do hi work and to find repos from it in the happi of love
she ought to be belov and noth more but like all men he forgot
that she too would want work and he wa surpris that she hi
poetic exquisit kitti could not mere in the first week but even
in the first dai of their marri life think rememb and busi
herself about tablecloth and furnitur about mattress for
visitor about a trai about the cook and the dinner and so on
while thei were still engag he had been struck by the definit
with which she had declin the tour abroad and decid to go into the
countri as though she knew of someth she want and could still
think of someth outsid her love thi had jar upon him then and
now her trivial care and anxieti jar upon him sever time but
he saw that thi wa essenti for her and love her as he did
though he did not understand the reason of them and jeer at these
domest pursuit he could not help admir them he jeer at the
wai in which she arrang the furnitur thei had brought from moscow
rearrang their room hung up curtain prepar room for visitor a
room for dolli saw after an abod for her new maid order dinner of
the old cook came into collis with agafea mihalovna take from
her the charg of the store he saw how the old cook smile admir
her and listen to her inexperienc imposs order how
mournfulli and tenderli agafea mihalovna shook her head over the young
mistresss new arrang he saw that kitti wa extraordinarili
sweet when laugh and cry she came to tell him that her maid
masha wa us to look upon her as her young ladi and so no on
obei her it seem to him sweet but strang and he thought it
would have been better without thi
he did not know how great a sens of chang she wa experienc she
who at home had sometim want some favorit dish or sweet without
the possibl of get either now could order what she like bui
pound of sweet spend as much monei as she like and order ani
pud she pleas
she wa dream with delight now of dolli come to them with her
children especi becaus she would order for the children their
favorit pud and dolli would appreci all her new housekeep
she did not know herself why and wherefor but the arrang of her
hous had an irresist attract for her instinct feel the
approach of spring and know that there would be dai of rough
weather too she built her nest as best she could and wa in hast at
the same time to build it and to learn how to do it
thi care for domest detail in kitti so oppos to levin ideal of
exalt happi wa at first on of the disappoint and thi
sweet care of her household the aim of which he did not understand
but could not help love wa on of the new happi surpris
anoth disappoint and happi surpris came in their quarrel levin
could never have conceiv that between him and hi wife ani relat
could aris other than tender respect and love and all at onc
in the veri earli dai thei quarrel so that she said he did not care
for her that he care for no on but himself burst into tear and
wrung her arm
thi first quarrel aros from levin have gone out to a new
farmhous and have been awai half an hour too long becaus he had
tri to get home by a short cut and had lost hi wai he drove home
think of noth but her of her love of hi own happi and the
nearer he drew to home the warmer wa hi tender for her he ran
into the room with the same feel with an even stronger feel than
he had had when he reach the shtcherbatski hous to make hi offer
and suddenli he wa met by a lower express he had never seen in
her he would have kiss her she push him awai
what is it
youv been enjoi yourself she began try to be calm and
spite but as soon as she open her mouth a stream of reproach of
senseless jealousi of all that had been tortur her dure that half
hour which she had spent sit motionless at the window burst from
her it wa onli then for the first time that he clearli understood
what he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the
wed he felt now that he wa not simpli close to her but that he
did not know where he end and she began he felt thi from the
agon sensat of divis that he experienc at that instant he
wa offend for the first instant but the veri same second he felt
that he could not be offend by her that she wa himself he felt for
the first moment as a man feel when have suddenli receiv a
violent blow from behind he turn round angri and eager to aveng
himself to look for hi antagonist and find that it is he himself
who ha accident struck himself that there is no on to be angri
with and that he must put up with and try to sooth the pain
never afterward did he feel it with such intens but thi first
time he could not for a long while get over it hi natur feel
urg him to defend himself to prove to her she wa wrong but to
prove her wrong would mean irrit her still more and make the
ruptur greater that wa the caus of all hi suffer on habitu
feel impel him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her
anoth feel even stronger impel him as quickli as possibl to
smooth over the ruptur without let it grow greater to remain
under such undeserv reproach wa wretch but to make her suffer by
justifi himself wa wors still like a man halfawak in an agoni
of pain he want to tear out to fling awai the ach place and
come to hi sens he felt that the ach place wa himself he
could do noth but try to help the ach place to bear it and thi
he tri to do
thei made peac she recogn that she wa wrong though she did
not sai so becam tender to him and thei experienc new redoubl
happi in their love but that did not prevent such quarrel from
happen again and exceedingli often too on the most unexpect and
trivial ground these quarrel frequent aros from the fact that
thei did not yet know what wa of import to each other and that all
thi earli period thei were both often in a bad temper when on wa in
a good temper and the other in a bad temper the peac wa not broken
but when both happen to be in an illhumor quarrel sprang up from
such incomprehens trifl caus that thei could never rememb
afterward what thei had quarrel about it is true that when thei
were both in a good temper their enjoy of life wa redoubl but
still thi first period of their marri life wa a difficult time for
them
dure all thi earli time thei had a peculiarli vivid sens of
tension as it were a tug in opposit direct of the chain by
which thei were bound altogeth their honeymoonthat is to sai the
month after their weddingfrom which from tradit levin expect so
much wa not mere not a time of sweet but remain in the
memori of both as the bitterest and most humili period in their
live thei both alik tri in later life to blot out from their
memori all the monstrou shame incid of that morbid period
when both were rare in a normal frame of mind both were rare quit
themselv
it wa onli in the third month of their marri life after their
return from moscow where thei had been stai for a month that their
life began to go more smoothli
chapter 15
thei had just come back from moscow and were glad to be alon he wa
sit at the writingt in hi studi write she wear the
dark lilac dress she had worn dure the first dai of their marri
life and put on again todai a dress particularli rememb and love
by him wa sit on the sofa the same oldfashion leather sofa
which had alwai stood in the studi in levin father and
grandfath dai she wa sew at broderi anglais he thought
and wrote never lose the happi conscious of her presenc hi
work both on the land and on the book in which the principl of the
new land system were to be laid down had not been abandon but just
as formerli these pursuit and idea had seem to him petti and
trivial in comparison with the dark that overspread all life now
thei seem as unimport and petti in comparison with the life that
lai befor him suffus with the brilliant light of happi he went
on with hi work but he felt now that the center of graviti of hi
attent had pass to someth els and that consequ he look
at hi work quit differ and more clearli formerli thi work had
been for him an escap from life formerli he had felt that without
thi work hi life would be too gloomi now these pursuit were
necessari for him that life might not be too uniformli bright take
up hi manuscript read through what he had written he found with
pleasur that the work wa worth hi work at mani of hi old idea
seem to him superflu and extrem but mani blank becam distinct
to him when he review the whole thing in hi memori he wa write
now a new chapter on the caus of the present disastr condit of
agricultur in russia he maintain that the poverti of russia aris
not mere from the anomal distribut of land properti and
misdirect reform but that what had contribut of late year to
thi result wa the civil from without abnorm graft upon
russia especi facil of commun as railwai lead to
central in town the develop of luxuri and the consequ
develop of manufactur credit and it accompani of

chapter 19
thou hast hid these thing from the wise and prudent and hast
reveal them unto babe so levin thought about hi wife as he talk
to her that even
levin thought of the text not becaus he consid himself wise and
prudent he did not so consid himself but he could not help know
that he had more intellect than hi wife and agafea mihalovna and he
could not help know that when he thought of death he thought with
all the forc of hi intellect he knew too that the brain of mani
great men whose thought he had read had brood over death and yet
knew not a hundredth part of what hi wife and agafea mihalovna knew
about it differ as those two women were agafea mihalovna and
katya as hi brother nikolai had call her and as levin particularli
like to call her now thei were quit alik in thi both knew
without a shade of doubt what sort of thing life wa and what wa
death and though neither of them could have answer and would even
not have understood the question that present themselv to levin
both had no doubt of the signific of thi event and were precis
alik in their wai of look at it which thei share with million of
peopl the proof that thei knew for a certainti the natur of death
lai in the fact that thei knew without a second of hesit how to
deal with the dy and were not frighten of them levin and other
men like him though thei could have said a great deal about death
obvious did not know thi sinc thei were afraid of death and were
absolut at a loss what to do when peopl were dy if levin had
been alon now with hi brother nikolai he would have look at him
with terror and with still greater terror wait and would not have
known what els to do
more than that he did not know what to sai how to look how to move
to talk of outsid thing seem to him shock imposs to talk
of death and depress subjectsalso imposs to be silent also
imposs if i look at him he will think i am studi him i am
afraid if i dont look at him hell think im think of other
thing if i walk on tipto he will be vex to tread firmli im
asham kitti evid did not think of herself and had no time to
think about herself she wa think about him becaus she knew
someth and all went well she told him about herself even and about
her wed and smile and sympath with him and pet him and
talk of case of recoveri and all went well so then she must know
the proof that her behavior and agafea mihalovna wa not instinct
anim irrat wa that apart from the physic treatment the
relief of suffer both agafea mihalovna and kitti requir for the
dy man someth els more import than the physic treatment
and someth which had noth in common with physic condit

expect of him wa to leav hi wife in peac without burden her
with hi presenc and that hi wife herself desir thi he felt so
distraught that he could come to no decis of himself he did not
know himself what he want now and put himself in the hand of
those who were so pleas to interest themselv in hi affair he met
everyth with unqualifi assent it wa onli when anna had left hi
hous and the english gover sent to ask him whether she should
dine with him or separ that for the first time he clearli
comprehend hi posit and wa appal by it most difficult of
all in thi posit wa the fact that he could not in ani wai connect
and reconcil hi past with what wa now it wa not the past when he
had live happili with hi wife that troubl him the transit from
that past to a knowledg of hi wife unfaith he had live
through miser alreadi that state wa pain but he could
understand it if hi wife had then on declar to him her
unfaith left him he would have been wound unhappi but he
would not have been in the hopeless positionincomprehens to
himselfin which he felt himself now he could not now reconcil hi
immedi past hi tender hi love for hi sick wife and for the
other man child with what wa now the case that is with the fact
that as it were in return for all thi he now found himself alon
put to shame a laughingstock need by no on and despis by
everyon
for the first two dai after hi wife departur alexei alexandrovitch
receiv applic for assist and hi chief secretari drove to
the committe and went down to dinner in the diningroom as usual
without give himself a reason for what he wa do he strain
everi nerv of hi be for those two dai simpli to preserv an

with her address
alexei alexandrovitch ponder as it seem to the clerk and all at

into hi hand he sat for a long while in that posit sever time
attempt to speak and stop short kornei perceiv hi master
emot ask the clerk to call anoth time left alon alexei
alexandrovitch recogn that he had not the strength to keep up the
line of firm and composur ani longer he gave order for the
carriag that wa await him to be taken back and for no on to be

he felt that he could not endur the weight of univers contempt and
exasper which he had distinctli seen in the face of the clerk and
of kornei and of everyon without except whom he had met dure

hatr of men becaus that hatr did not come from hi be bad in

consol salvat and love she said and turn her ey
heavenward she began prai as alexei alexandrovitch gather from
her silenc
alexei alexandrovitch listen to her now and those express which
had seem to him if not distast at least exagger now seem
to him natur and consolatori alexei alexandrovitch had dislik thi
new enthusiast fervor he wa a believ who wa interest in
religion primarili in it polit aspect and the new doctrin which
ventur upon sever new interpret just becaus it pave the
wai to discuss and analysi wa in principl disagre to him
he had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonist attitud to thi
new doctrin and with countess lidia ivanovna who had been carri
awai by it he had never argu but by silenc had assidu parri
her attempt to provok him into argument now for the first time he
heard her word with pleasur and did not inwardli oppos them
i am veri veri grate to you both for your deed and for your

countess lidia ivanovna went into seryozha part of the hous and
drop tear on the scare child cheek she told him that hi
father wa a saint and hi mother wa dead
countess lidia ivanovna kept her promis she did actual take upon
herself the care of the organ and manag of alexei
alexandrovitch household but she had not overst the case when
sai that practic affair were not her strong point all her
arrang had to be modifi becaus thei could not be carri out
and thei were modifi by kornei alexei alexandrovitch valet who
though no on wa awar of the fact now manag karenin household
and quietli and discreetli report to hi master while he wa dress
all it wa necessari for him to know but lidia ivanovna help wa
none the less real she gave alexei alexandrovitch moral support in the
conscious of her love and respect for him and still more as it
wa sooth to her to believ in that she almost turn him to
christianitythat is from an indiffer and apathet believ she
turn him into an ardent and steadfast adher of the new
interpret of christian doctrin which had been gain ground of
late in petersburg it wa easi for alexei alexandrovitch to believ in
thi teach alexei alexandrovitch like lidia ivanovna inde and
other who share their view wa complet devoid of vivid of
imagin that spiritu faculti in virtu of which the concept
evok by the imagin becom so vivid that thei must need be in
harmoni with other concept and with actual fact he saw noth
imposs and inconceiv in the idea that death though exist
for unbeliev did not exist for him and that as he wa possess
of the most perfect faith of the measur of which he wa himself the
judg therefor there wa no sin in hi soul and he wa experienc
complet salvat here on earth
it is true that the erron and shallow of thi concept of
hi faith wa dimli percept to alexei alexandrovitch and he knew
that when without the slightest idea that hi forgiv wa the
action of a higher power he had surrend directli to the feel of

open it although alexei alexandrovitch had more than onc told
seryozha that everi christian ought to know scriptur histori
thoroughli he often refer to the bibl himself dure the lesson
and seryozha observ thi
ye it wa veri nice inde papa said seryozha sit sidewai
on hi chair and rock it which wa forbidden i saw nadinka
nadinka wa a niec of lidia ivanovna who wa be brought up in
her hous she told me youd been given a new star ar you glad
papa
first of all dont rock your chair pleas said alexei
alexandrovitch and secondli it not the reward that preciou but
the work itself and i could have wish you understood that if you

storybook boi
you understand that i hope said hi father
ye papa answer seryozha act the part of the imaginari boi
the lesson consist of learn by heart sever vers out of the
gospel and the repetit of the begin of the old testament the
vers from the gospel seryozha knew fairli well but at the moment
when he wa sai them he becam so absorb in watch the sharpli
protrud boni knobbi of hi father forehead that he lost the

anoth so it wa evid to alexei alexandrovitch that he did not
understand what he wa sai and that irrit him
he frown and began explain what seryozha had heard mani time
befor and never could rememb becaus he understood it too well
just as that suddenli is an adverb of manner of action seryozha
look with scare ey at hi father and could think of noth but
whether hi father would make him repeat what he had said as he
sometim did and thi thought so alarm seryozha that he now
understood noth but hi father did not make him repeat it and

inconceiv and imposs but he had been told that all men die he
had ask peopl inde whom he trust and thei too had confirm
it hi old nurs too said the same though reluctantli but enoch

said he wa a stupid boi on the contrari he wa far clever than the
boi hi teacher held up as exampl to seryozha in hi father
opinion he did not want to learn what he wa taught in realiti he
could not learn that he could not becaus the claim of hi own soul

conflict with hi educ he wa nine year old he wa a child but
he knew hi own soul it wa preciou to him he guard it as the
eyelid guard the ey and without the kei of love he let no on into
hi soul hi teacher complain that he would not learn while hi
soul wa brim over with thirst for knowledg and he learn from
kapitonitch from hi nurs from nadinka from vassili lukitch but
not from hi teacher the spring hi father and hi teacher reckon

seryozha vassili lukitch wa in a good humor and show him how to
make windmil the whole even pass over thi work and in dream
how to make a windmil on which he could turn himselfclutch at the
sail or ty himself on and whirl round of hi mother seryozha
did not think all the even but when he had gone to bed he suddenli

on the dai of hi arriv vronski went to hi brother there he found
hi mother who had come from moscow on busi hi mother and
sisterinlaw greet him as usual thei ask him about hi stai
abroad and talk of their common acquaint but did not let drop
a singl word in allus to hi connect with anna hi brother came
the next morn to see vronski and of hi own accord ask him about
her and alexei vronski told him directli that he look upon hi
connect with madam karenina as marriag that he hope to arrang a
divorc and then to marri her and until then he consid her as
much a wife as ani other wife and he beg him to tell their mother
and hi wife so
if the world disapprov i dont care said vronski but if my
relat want to be on term of relationship with me thei will have
to be on the same term with my wife
the elder brother who had alwai a respect for hi younger brother
judgment could not well tell whether he wa right or not till the
world had decid the question for hi part he had noth against it
and with alexei he went up to see anna
befor hi brother as befor everyon vronski address anna with a
certain formal treat her as he might a veri intim friend but
it wa understood that hi brother knew their real relat and thei
talk about anna go to vronski estat
in spite of all hi social experi vronski wa in consequ of
the new posit in which he wa place labor under a strang
misapprehens on would have thought he must have understood that
societi wa close for him and anna but now some vagu idea had
sprung up in hi brain that thi wa onli the case in oldfashion
dai and that now with the rapid of modern progress he had
unconsci becom by now a partisan of everi sort of progress the
view of societi had chang and that the question whether thei would
be receiv in societi wa not a foregon conclus of cours he
thought she would not be receiv at court but intim friend can
and must look at it in the proper light on mai sit for sever hour
at a stretch with on leg cross in the same posit if on know
that there noth to prevent on chang on posit but if a
man know that he must remain sit so with cross leg then cramp
come on the leg begin to twitch and to strain toward the spot to
which on would like to draw them thi wa what vronski wa
experienc in regard to the world though at the bottom of hi heart
he knew that the world wa shut on them he put it to the test whether
the world had not chang by now and would not receiv them but he
veri quickli perceiv that though the world wa open for him
person it wa close for anna just as in the game of cat and
mous the hand rais for him were drop to bar the wai for anna
on of the first ladi of petersburg societi whom vronski saw wa hi
cousin betsi
at last she greet him joyfulli and anna how glad i am where
ar you stop i can fanci after your delight travel you must
find our poor petersburg horrid i can fanci your honeymoon in rome
how about the divorc is that all over
vronski notic that betsi enthusiasm wane when she learn that no
divorc had as yet taken place
peopl will throw stone at me i know she said but i shall come
and see anna ye i shall certainli come you wont be here long i
suppos
and she did certainli come to see anna the same dai but her tone wa
not at all the same as in former dai she unmistak pride herself
on her courag and wish anna to appreci the fidel of her
friendship she onli stai ten minut talk of societi gossip and
on leav she said

fling my cap over the mill other starchi peopl will give you the cold
shoulder until your marri and that so simpl nowadai a se
fait so your go on fridai sorri we shant see each other
again
from betsi tone vronski might have grasp what he had to expect from
the world but he made anoth effort in hi own famili hi mother he
did not reckon upon he knew that hi mother who had been so
enthusiast over anna at their first acquaint would have no merci
on her now for have ruin her son career but he had more hope of
varya hi brother wife he fanci she would not throw stone and
would go simpli and directli to see anna and would receiv her in her
own hous
the dai after hi arriv vronski went to her and find her alon
express hi wish directli
you know alexei she said after hear him how fond i am of you
and how readi i am to do anyth for you but i have not spoken
becaus i knew i could be of no us to you and to anna arkadyevna she
said articul the name anna arkadyevna with particular care
dont suppos pleas that i judg her never perhap in her place i
should have done the same i dont and cant enter into that she
said glanc timidli at hi gloomi face but on must call thing by
their name you want me to go and see her to ask her here and to
rehabilit her in societi but do understand that i cannot do so i
have daughter grow up and i must live in the world for my
husband sake well im readi to come and see anna arkadyevna she
will understand that i cant ask her here or i should have to do so in
such a wai that she would not meet peopl who look at thing
differ that would offend her i cant rais her
oh i dont regard her as fallen more than hundr of women you do
receiv vronski interrupt her still more gloomili and he got up in
silenc understand that hi sisterinlaw decis wa not to be
shaken
alexei dont be angri with me pleas understand that im not to
blame began varya look at him with a timid smile
im not angri with you he said still as gloomili but im sorri in
two wai im sorri too that thi mean break up our friendshipif
not break up at least weaken it you will understand that for
me too it cannot be otherwis
and with that he left her
vronski knew that further effort were useless and that he had to
spend these few dai in petersburg as though in a strang town
avoid everi sort of relat with hi own old circl in order not to
be expos to the annoy and humili which were so intoler
to him on of the most unpleas featur of hi posit in
petersburg wa that alexei alexandrovitch and hi name seem to meet
him everywher he could not begin to talk of anyth without the
convers turn on alexei alexandrovitch he could not go anywher
without risk of meet him so at least it seem to vronski just as
it seem to a man with a sore finger that he is continu as though
on purpos graze hi sore finger on everyth
their stai in petersburg wa the more pain to vronski that he
perceiv all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand
in anna at on time she would seem in love with him and then she
would becom cold irrit and impenetr she wa worri over
someth and keep someth back from him and did not seem to
notic the humili which poison hi exist and for her with
her delic intuit must have been still more unbear
chapter 29
on of anna object in come back to russia had been to see her son

the fact that to arrang thi meet wa no easi matter
she had now been two dai in petersburg the thought of her son never
left her for a singl instant but she had not yet seen him to go
straight to the hous where she might meet alexei alexandrovitch that
she felt she had no right to do she might be refus admitt and
insult to write and so enter into relat with her husbandthat it
made her miser to think of do she could onli be at peac when

cruel and unexpect answer that there wa no answer she had never
felt so humili as at the moment when send for the
commissionair she heard from him the exact account of how he had

felt humili insult but she saw that from her point of view
countess lidia ivanovna wa right her suffer wa the more poignant
that she had to bear it in solitud she could not and would not share
it with vronski she knew that to him although he wa the primari
caus of her distress the question of her see her son would seem a
matter of veri littl consequ she knew that he would never be
capabl of understand all the depth of her suffer that for hi
cool tone at ani allus to it she would begin to hate him and she

time visibl excit at the possibl of receiv a declar from
the man she care for wa veri attract sergei ivanovitch walk
besid her and never left off admir her look at her he
recal all the delight thing he had heard from her lip all the
good he knew about her and becam more and more consciou that the
feel he had for her wa someth special that he had felt long
long ago and onli onc in hi earli youth the feel of happi
in be near her continu grew and at last reach such a point
that as he put a huge slenderstalk agar fungu in her basket he
look straight into her face and notic the flush of glad and
alarm excit that overspread her face he wa confus himself
and smile to her in silenc a smile that said too much
if so he said to himself i ought to think it over and make up my
mind and not give wai like a boi to the impuls of a moment
im go to pick by myself apart from all the rest or els my
effort will make no show he said and he left the edg of the forest
where thei were walk on low silki grass between old birch tree
stand far apart and went more into the heart of the wood where
between the white birch trunk there were grai trunk of aspen and dark
bush of hazel walk some forti pace awai sergei ivanovitch
know he wa out of sight stood still behind a bushi spindletre in
full flower with it rosi red catkin it wa perfectli still all round
him onli overhead in the birch under which he stood the fli like
a swarm of bee buzz unceasingli and from time to time the
children voic were float across to him all at onc he heard not
far from the edg of the wood the sound of varenka contralto voic
call grisha and a smile of delight pass over sergei ivanovitch
face consciou of thi smile he shook hi head disapprovingli at hi
own condit and take out a cigar he began light it for a long
while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch
tree the soft scale of the white bark rub off the phosphoru and
the light went out at last on of the match burn and the fragrant
cigar smoke hover uncertainli in flat wide coil stretch awai
forward and upward over a bush under the overhang branch of a
birch tree watch the streak of smoke sergei ivanovitch walk
gentli on deliber on hi posit
why not he thought if it were onli a pass fanci or a passion
if it were onli thi attractionthi mutual attract i can call it a
mutual attract but if i felt that it wa in contradict with
the whole bent of my lifeif i felt that in give wai to thi
attract i should be fals to my vocat and my duti but it
not so the onli thing i can sai against it is that when i lost mari
i said to myself that i would remain faith to her memori that the
onli thing i can sai against my feel that a great thing
sergei ivanovitch said to himself feel at the same time that thi
consider had not the slightest import for him person but
would onli perhap detract from hi romant charact in the ey of
other but apart from that howev much i search i should never
find anyth to sai against my feel if i were choos by
consider of suitabl alon i could not have found anyth
better
howev mani women and girl he thought of whom he knew he could not
think of a girl who unit to such a degre all posit all the
qualiti he would wish to see in hi wife she had all the charm and
fresh of youth but she wa not a child and if she love him she
love him conscious as a woman ought to love that wa on thing
anoth point she wa not onli far from be worldli but had an
unmistak distast for worldli societi and at the same time she
knew the world and had all the wai of a woman of the best societi
which were absolut essenti to sergei ivanovitch concept of
the woman who wa to share hi life thirdli she wa religi and
not like a child unconsci religi and good as kitti for
exampl wa but her life wa found on religi principl even in
trifl matter sergei ivanovitch found in her all that he want in
hi wife she wa poor and alon in the world so she would not bring
with her a mass of relat and their influenc into her husband
hous as he saw now in kitti case she would ow everyth to her
husband which wa what he had alwai desir too for hi futur famili
life and thi girl who unit all these qualiti love him he wa
a modest man but he could not help see it and he love her there
wa on consider against ithi ag but he came of a longliv
famili he had not a singl grai hair no on would have taken him for
forti and he rememb varenka sai that it wa onli in russia
that men of fifti thought themselv old and that in franc a man of
fifti consid himself dan la forc de lge while a man of forti
is un jeun homm but what did the mere reckon of year matter
when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenti year ago wa it
not youth to feel as he felt now when come from the other side to
the edg of the wood he saw in the glow light of the slant
sunbeam the graciou figur of varenka in her yellow gown with her
basket walk lightli by the trunk of an old birch tree and when
thi impress of the sight of varenka blend so harmoni with
the beauti of the view of the yellow oatfield ly bath in the
slant sunshin and beyond it the distant ancient forest fleck
with yellow and melt into the blue of the distanc hi heart
throb joyous a soften feel came over him he felt that he
had made up hi mind varenka who had just crouch down to pick a
mushroom rose with a suppl movement and look round fling awai

sweet deep voic

that on too near the twig she point out to littl masha a littl
fungu split in half across it rosi cap by the dry grass from under
which it thrust itself varenka got up while masha pick the fungu

thei walk on for some step in silenc varenka saw that he want to
speak she guess of what and felt faint with joi and panic thei had
walk so far awai that no on could hear them now but still he did
not begin to speak it would have been better for varenka to be silent
after a silenc it would have been easier for them to sai what thei
want to sai than after talk about mushroom but against her own
will as it were accident varenka said
so you found noth in the middl of the wood there ar alwai
fewer though sergei ivanovitch sigh and made no answer he wa
annoi that she had spoken about the mushroom he want to bring her
back to the first word she had utter about her childhood but after
a paus of some length as though against hi own will he made an
observ in respons to her last word

almost certain that she wa in love with him and thi moment it would
have to be decid she felt frighten she dread both hi speak
and hi not speak

everyth in the express the flush cheek and the downcast ey
of varenka betrai a pain suspens sergei ivanovitch saw it and
felt sorri for her he felt even that to sai noth now would be a
slight to her rapidli in hi own mind he ran over all the argument in
support of hi decis he even said over to himself the word in
which he meant to put hi offer but instead of those word some
utterli unexpect reflect that occur to him made him ask
what is the differ between the birch mushroom and the white
mushroom
varenka lip quiver with emot as she answer
in the top part there is scarc ani differ it in the stalk
and as soon as these word were utter both he and she felt that it
wa over that what wa to have been said would not be said and their
emot which had up to then been continu grow more intens
began to subsid
the birch mushroom stalk suggest a dark man chin after two dai
without shave said sergei ivanovitch speak quit calmli now

direct of their walk chang thei began to turn toward the
children varenka felt both sore and asham at the same time she had

ivanovitch thought hi previou decis had been a mistaken on he
could not be fals to the memori of mari
gentli children gentli levin shout quit angrili to the
children stand befor hi wife to protect her when the crowd of
children flew with shriek of delight to meet them

observ and sank into repos again her head on on side and on
ear prick up to listen at last the door open with a creak and
stepan arkadyevitch spotandtan pointer krak flew out run round
and round and turn over in the air stepan arkadyevitch himself
follow with a gun in hi hand and a cigar in hi mouth
good dog good dog krak he cri encouragingli to the dog who put
hi paw up on hi chest catch at hi game bag stepan arkadyevitch
wa dress in rough leg and spat in torn trouser and a short
coat on hi head there wa a wreck of a hat of indefinit form but
hi gun of a new patent wa a perfect gem and hi game bag and
cartridg belt though worn were of the veri best qualiti
vassenka veslovski had had no notion befor that it wa truli chic
for a sportsman to be in tatter but to have hi shoot outfit of
the best qualiti he saw it now as he look at stepan arkadyevitch
radiant in hi rag grace wellf and joyou a typic russian
nobleman and he made up hi mind that next time he went shoot he
would certainli adopt the same getup
well and what about our host he ask
a young wife said stepan arkadyevitch smile
ye and such a charm on
he came down dress no doubt he run up to her again
stepan arkadyevitch guess right levin had run up again to hi wife
to ask her onc more if she forgav him for hi idioci yesterdai and
moreov to beg her for christ sake to be more care the great
thing wa for her to keep awai from the childrenthei might ani minut
push against her then he had onc more to hear her declar that she
wa not angri with him for go awai for two dai and to beg her to
be sure to send him a note next morn by a servant on horseback to
write him if it were but two word onli to let him know that all wa
well with her
kitti wa distress as she alwai wa at part for a coupl of
dai from her husband but when she saw hi eager figur look big
and strong in hi shootingboot and hi white blous and a sort of
sportsman elat and excit incomprehens to her she forgot
her own chagrin for the sake of hi pleasur and said goodby to him
cheerfulli
pardon gentlemen he said run out onto the step have you put
the lunch in why is the chestnut on the right well it doesnt
matter laska down go and lie down
put it with the herd of oxen he said to the herdsman who wa
wait for him at the step with some question excus me here come
anoth villain
levin jump out of the wagonett in which he had alreadi taken hi
seat to meet the carpent who came toward the step with a rule in
hi hand
you didnt come to the count hous yesterdai and now your
detain me well what is it
would your honor let me make anoth turn it onli three step to
add and we make it just fit at the same time it will be much more
conveni
you should have listen to me levin answer with annoy i
said put the line and then fit in the step now there no set
it right do as i told you and make a new staircas
the point wa that in the lodg that wa be built the carpent had
spoil the staircas fit it togeth without calcul the
space it wa to fill so that the step were all slope when it wa
put in place now the carpent want keep the same staircas to
add three step
it will be much better
but where your staircas come out with it three step
why upon my word sir the carpent said with a contemptu smile
it come out right at the veri spot it start so to speak he said
with a persuas gestur it come down and come down and come
out
but three step will add to the length too where is it to come
out
why to be sure itll start from the bottom and go up and go up and
come out so the carpent said obstin and convincingli
itll reach the ceil and the wall
upon my word why itll go up and up and come out like thi
levin took out a ramrod and began sketch him the staircas in the
dust
there do you see
as your honor like said the carpent with a sudden gleam in hi
ey obvious understand the thing at last it seem itll be
best to make a new on
well then do it as your told levin shout seat himself in
the wagonett down hold the dog philip
levin felt now at leav behind all hi famili and household care
such an eager sens of joi in life and expect that he wa not
dispos to talk besid that he had that feel of concentr
excit that everi sportsman experi as he approach the scene
of action if he had anyth on hi mind at that moment it wa onli
the doubt whether thei would start anyth in the kolpenski marsh
whether laska would show to advantag in comparison with krak and
whether he would shoot well that dai himself not to disgrac himself
befor a new spectatornot to be outdon by oblonskythat too wa a
thought that cross hi brain
oblonski wa feel the same and he too wa not talk vassenka
veslovski kept up alon a ceaseless flow of cheer chatter as he
listen to him now levin felt asham to think how unfair he had been
to him the dai befor vassenka wa realli a nice fellow simpl
goodheart and veri goodhumor if levin had met him befor he wa
marri he would have made friend with him levin rather dislik hi
holidai attitud to life and a sort of free and easi assumpt of
eleg it wa as though he assum a high degre of import in
himself that could not be disput becaus he had long nail and a
stylish cap and everyth els to correspond but thi could be
forgiven for the sake of hi good natur and good breed levin like
him for hi good educ for speak french and english with such
an excel accent and for be a man of hi world
vassenka wa extrem delight with the left hors a hors of the
don stepp he kept prais him enthusiast how fine it must
be gallop over the stepp on a stepp hors eh isnt it he
said he had imagin ride on a stepp hors as someth wild and
romant and it turn out noth of the sort but hi simplic
particularli in conjunct with hi good look hi amiabl smile and
the grace of hi movement wa veri attract either becaus hi
natur wa sympathet to levin or becaus levin wa try to aton
for hi sin of the previou even by see noth but what wa
good in him anywai he like hi societi
after thei had driven over two mile from home veslovski all at onc
felt for a cigar and hi pocketbook and did not know whether he had
lost them or left them on the tabl in the pocketbook there were
thirtyseven pound and so the matter could not be left in
uncertainti
do you know what levin ill gallop home on that left tracehors
that will be splendid eh he said prepar to get out
no why should you answer levin calcul that vassenka could
hardli weigh less than seventeen stone ill send the coachman
the coachman rode back on the tracehors and levin himself drove the
remain pair
chapter 9

littl place but i doubt there be anyth to shoot
levin would himself have like to go into these littl place but thei
were near home he could shoot them over ani time and thei were onli
littl placesther would hardli be room for three to shoot and so
with some insincer he said that he doubt there be anyth to
shoot when thei reach a littl marsh levin would have driven by but
stepan arkadyevitch with the experienc ey of a sportsman at onc
detect reed visibl from the road
shant we try that he said point to the littl marsh
levin do pleas how delight vassenka veslovski began beg
and levin could but consent
befor thei had time to stop the dog had flown on befor the other
into the marsh
krak laska
the dog came back
there wont be room for three ill stai here said levin hope
thei would find noth but peewit who had been startl by the dog
and turn over in their flight were plaintiv wail over the
marsh
no come along levin let go togeth veslovski call
realli there not room laska back laska you wont want anoth
dog will you
levin remain with the wagonett and look envious at the
sportsmen thei walk right across the marsh except littl bird and
peewit of which vassenka kill on there wa noth in the marsh
come you see now that it wa not that i grudg the marsh said
levin onli it wast time

veslovski clamber awkwardli into the wagonett with hi gun and hi
peewit in hi hand how splendidli i shot thi bird didnt i well
shall we soon be get to the real place
the hors start off suddenli levin knock hi head against the
stock of someon gun and there wa the report of a shot the gun did
actual go off first but that wa how it seem to levin it appear
that vassenka veslovski had pull onli on trigger and had left the
other hammer still cock the charg flew into the ground without
do harm to anyon stepan arkadyevitch shook hi head and laugh
reprovingli at veslovski but levin had not the heart to reprov him
in the first place ani reproach would have seem to be call forth
by the danger he had incur and the bump that had come up on levin
forehead and besid veslovski wa at first so nave distress
and then laugh so goodhumoredli and infecti at their gener
dismai that on could not but laugh with him
when thei reach the second marsh which wa fairli larg and would
inevit take some time to shoot over levin tri to persuad them
to pass it by but veslovski again overpersuad him again as the
marsh wa narrow levin like a good host remain with the carriag
krak made straight for some clump of sedg vassenka veslovski wa the
first to run after the dog befor stepan arkadyevitch had time to come
up a grous flew out veslovski miss it and it flew into an unmown
meadow thi grous wa left for veslovski to follow up krak found it
again and point and veslovski shot it and went back to the carriag
now you go and ill stai with the hors he said
levin had begun to feel the pang of a sportsman envi he hand the
rein to veslovski and walk into the marsh
laska who had been plaintiv whine and fret against the
injustic of her treatment flew straight ahead to a hope place that
levin knew well and that krak had not yet come upon
why dont you stop her shout stepan arkadyevitch
she wont scare them answer levin sympath with hi bitch
pleasur and hurri after her
as she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breed place there wa
more and more earnest in laska explor a littl marsh bird
did not divert her attent for more than an instant she made on
circuit round the clump of reed wa begin a second and suddenli
quiver with excit and becam motionless
come come stiva shout levin feel hi heart begin to beat
more violent and all of a sudden as though some sort of shutter had
been drawn back from hi strain ear all sound confus but loud
began to beat on hi hear lose all sens of distanc he heard
the step of stepan arkadyevitch mistak them for the tramp of the
hors in the distanc he heard the brittl sound of the twig on
which he had trodden take thi sound for the fly of a grous he
heard too not far behind him a splash in the water which he could
not explain to himself
pick hi step he move up to the dog
fetch it
not a grous but a snipe flew up from besid the dog levin had lift
hi gun but at the veri instant when he wa take aim the sound of
splash grew louder came closer and wa join with the sound of
veslovski voic shout someth with strang loud levin saw
he had hi gun point behind the snipe but still he fire
when he had made sure he had miss levin look round and saw the
hors and the wagonett not on the road but in the marsh
veslovski eager to see the shoot had driven into the marsh and
got the hors stuck in the mud
damn the fellow levin said to himself as he went back to the
carriag that had sunk in the mire what did you drive in for he
said to him dryli and call the coachman he began pull the
hors out
levin wa vex both at be hinder from shoot and at hi hors
get stuck in the mud and still more at the fact that neither
stepan arkadyevitch nor veslovski help him and the coachman to
unhar the hors and get them out sinc neither of them had the
slightest notion of har without vouchsaf a syllabl in repli
to vassenka protest that it had been quit dry there levin
work in silenc with the coachman at extric the hors but
then as he got warm at the work and saw how assidu veslovski wa
tug at the wagonett by on of the mudguard so that he broke it
inde levin blame himself for have under the influenc of
yesterdai feel been too cold to veslovski and tri to be
particularli genial so as to smooth over hi chilli when
everyth had been put right and the carriag had been brought back
to the road levin had the lunch serv

not let go the rein when levin beg him to let the coachman
drive no i must aton for my sin and im veri comfort on the
box and he drove
levin wa a littl afraid he would exhaust the hors especi the
chestnut whom he did not know how to hold in but unconsci he
fell under the influenc of hi gaieti and listen to the song he
sang all the wai on the box or the descript and represent he
gave of drive in the english fashion fourinhand and it wa in the
veri best of spirit that after lunch thei drove to the gvozdyov marsh
chapter 10
vassenka drove the hors so smartli that thei reach the marsh too
earli while it wa still hot
as thei drew near thi more import marsh the chief aim of their
expedit levin could not help consid how he could get rid of
vassenka and be free in hi movement stepan arkadyevitch evid
had the same desir and on hi face levin saw the look of anxieti
alwai present in a true sportsman when begin shoot togeth
with a certain goodhumor slyness peculiar to him
how shall we go it a splendid marsh i see and there ar hawk
said stepan arkadyevitch point to two great bird hover over the
reed where there ar hawk there is sure to be game
now gentlemen said levin pull up hi boot and examin the
lock of hi gun with rather a gloomi express do you see those
reed he point to an oasi of blackish green in the huge halfmown
wet meadow that stretch along the right bank of the river the marsh
begin here straight in front of us do you seewher it is greener
from here it run to the right where the hors ar there ar breed
place there and grous and all round those reed as far as that
alder and right up to the mill over there do you see where the
pool ar that the best place there i onc shot seventeen snipe
well separ with the dog and go in differ direct and then
meet over there at the mill
well which shall go to left and which to right ask stepan
arkadyevitch it wider to the right you two go that wai and ill
take the left he said with appar careless
capit well make the bigger bag ye come along come along
vassenka exclaim
levin could do noth but agre and thei divid
as soon as thei enter the marsh the two dog began hunt about
togeth and made toward the green slimecov pool levin knew
laska method wari and indefinit he knew the place too and expect
a whole covei of snipe
veslovski besid me walk besid me he said in a faint voic to hi
companion splash in the water behind him levin could not help
feel an interest in the direct hi gun wa point after that
casual shot near the kolpenski marsh
oh i wont get in your wai dont troubl about me
but levin could not help troubl and recal kitti word at
part mind you dont shoot on anoth the dog came nearer and
nearer pass each other each pursu it own scent the expect
of snipe wa so intens that to levin the squelch sound of hi own
heel as he drew it up out of the mire seem to be the call of a
snipe and he clutch and press the lock of hi gun
bang bang sound almost in hi ear vassenka had fire at a flock
of duck which wa hover over the marsh and fly at that moment
toward the sportsmen far out of rang befor levin had time to look
round there wa the whir of on snipe anoth a third and some
eight more rose on after anoth
stepan arkadyevitch hit on at the veri moment when it wa begin
it zigzag movement and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud
oblonski aim deliber at anoth still fly low in the reed
and togeth with the report of the shot that snipe too fell and it
could be seen flutter out where the sedg had been cut it unhurt
wing show white beneath
levin wa not so lucki he aim at hi first bird too low and miss
he aim at it again just as it wa rise but at that instant
anoth snipe flew up at hi veri feet distract him so that he
miss again
while thei were load their gun anoth snipe rose and veslovski
who had had time to load again sent two charg of smallshot into the
water stepan arkadyevitch pick up hi snipe and with sparkl ey
look at levin
well now let us separ said stepan arkadyevitch and limp on
hi left foot hold hi gun in readi and whistl to hi dog
he walk off in on direct levin and veslovski walk in the
other
it alwai happen with levin that when hi first shot were a failur
he got hot and out of temper and shot badli the whole dai so it wa
that dai the snipe show themselv in number thei kept fly up
from just under the dog from under the sportsmen leg and levin
might have retriev hi ill luck but the more he shot the more he
felt disgrac in the ey of veslovski who kept pop awai merrili
and indiscrimin kill noth and not in the slightest abash
by hi ill success levin in feverish hast could not restrain
himself got more and more out of temper and end by shoot almost
without a hope of hit laska inde seem to understand thi
she began look more languidli and gaze back at the sportsmen as
it were with perplex or reproach in her ey shot follow shot
in rapid success the smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen
while in the great roomi net of the game bag there were onli three
light littl snipe and of these on had been kill by veslovski
alon and on by both of them togeth meanwhil from the other side
of the marsh came the sound of stepan arkadyevitch shot not
frequent but as levin fanci welldirect for almost after each
thei heard krak krak apport
thi excit levin still more the snipe were float continu in
the air over the reed their whir wing close to the earth and
their harsh cri high in the air could be heard on all side the
snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air settl again
befor the sportsmen instead of two hawk there were now dozen of
them hover with shrill cri over the marsh
after walk through the larger half of the marsh levin and veslovski
reach the place where the peasant mowinggrass wa divid into
long strip reach to the reed mark off in on place by the
trampl grass in anoth by a path mown through it half of these
strip had alreadi been mown
though there wa not so much hope of find bird in the uncut part as
the cut part levin had promis stepan arkadyevitch to meet him and
so he walk on with hi companion through the cut and uncut patch
hi sportsmen shout on of a group of peasant sit on an
unhar cart come and have some lunch with us have a drop of
wine

chapter 11
when levin and stepan arkadyevitch reach the peasant hut where
levin alwai us to stai veslovski wa alreadi there he wa sit
in the middl of the hut cling with both hand to the bench from
which he wa be pull by a soldier the brother of the peasant
wife who wa help him off with hi miri boot veslovski wa
laugh hi infecti goodhumor laugh
iv onli just come il ont t charmant just fanci thei gave me
drink fed me such bread it wa exquisit dlicieux and the
vodka i never tast ani better and thei would not take a penni for
anyth and thei kept sai excus our home wai
what should thei take anyth for thei were entertain you to be
sure do you suppos thei keep vodka for sale said the soldier
succeed at last in pull the soak boot off the blacken
stock
in spite of the dirti of the hut which wa all muddi by their
boot and the filthi dog lick themselv clean and the smell of
marsh mud and powder that fill the room and the absenc of knive
and fork the parti drank their tea and at their supper with a relish
onli known to sportsmen wash and clean thei went into a haybarn
swept readi for them where the coachman had been make up bed for
the gentlemen
though it wa dusk not on of them want to go to sleep
after waver among reminisc and anecdot of gun of dog and
of former shoot parti the convers rest on a topic that
interest all of them after vassenka had sever time over express
hi appreci of thi delight sleep place among the fragrant
hai thi delight broken cart he suppos it to be broken becaus
the shaft had been taken out of the good natur of the peasant that
had treat him to vodka of the dog who lai at the feet of their
respect master oblonski began tell them of a delight
shoot parti at malthuss where he had stai the previou summer
malthu wa a wellknown capitalist who had made hi monei by
specul in railwai share stepan arkadyevitch describ what
grous moor thi malthu had bought in the tver provinc and how thei
were preserv and of the carriag and dogcart in which the shoot
parti had been driven and the luncheon pavilion that had been rig
up at the marsh
i dont understand you said levin sit up in the hai how is it
such peopl dont disgust you i can understand a lunch with lafitt is
all veri pleasant but dont you dislik just that veri sumptuous
all these peopl just like our spirit monopolist in old dai get
their monei in a wai that gain them the contempt of everyon thei
dont care for their contempt and then thei us their dishonest gain
to bui off the contempt thei have deserv
perfectli true chime in vassenka veslovski perfectli oblonski
of cours goe out of bonhomi but other peopl sai well
oblonski stai with them
not a bit of it levin could hear that oblonski wa smile as he
spoke i simpli dont consid him more dishonest than ani other
wealthi merchant or nobleman theyv all made their monei alikebi
their work and their intellig
oh by what work do you call it work to get hold of concess and
specul with them
of cours it work work in thi sens that if it were not for him
and other like him there would have been no railwai
but that not work like the work of a peasant or a learn
profess
grant but it work in the sens that hi activ produc a
resultth railwai but of cours you think the railwai useless
no that anoth question i am prepar to admit that theyr
us but all profit that is out of proport to the labor expend
is dishonest
but who is to defin what is proportion
make profit by dishonest mean by trickeri said levin consciou
that he could not draw a distinct line between honesti and dishonesti
such as bank for instanc he went on it an evilth amass
of huge fortun without labor just the same thing as with the spirit
monopoli it onli the form that chang le roi est mort vive
le roi no sooner were the spirit monopoli abolish than the
railwai came up and bank compani that too is profit without
work
ye that mai all be veri true and clever lie down krak stepan
arkadyevitch call to hi dog who wa scratch and turn over all
the hai he wa obvious convinc of the correct of hi posit
and so talk seren and without hast but you have not drawn the
line between honest and dishonest work that i receiv a bigger salari
than my chief clerk though he know more about the work than i
dothat dishonest i suppos
i cant sai
well but i can tell you your receiv some five thousand let
sai for your work on the land while our host the peasant here
howev hard he work can never get more than fifti roubl is just
as dishonest as my earn more than my chief clerk and malthu
get more than a stationmast no quit the contrari i see that
societi take up a sort of antagonist attitud to these peopl which
is utterli baseless and i fanci there envi at the bottom of it
no that unfair said veslovski how could envi come in there is
someth not nice about that sort of busi
you sai levin went on that it unjust for me to receiv five
thousand while the peasant ha fifti that true it is unfair and i
feel it but
it realli is why is it we spend our time ride drink shoot
do noth while thei ar forev at work said vassenka
veslovski obvious for the first time in hi life reflect on the
question and consequ consid it with perfect sincer
ye you feel it but you dont give him your properti said stepan
arkadyevitch intention as it seem provok levin
there had arisen of late someth like a secret antagon between the
two brothersinlaw as though sinc thei had marri sister a kind
of rivalri had sprung up between them as to which wa order hi life
best and now thi hostil show itself in the convers as it
began to take a person note
i dont give it awai becaus no on demand that from me and if i
want to i could not give it awai answer levin and have no on
to give it to
give it to thi peasant he would not refus it
ye but how am i to give it up am i to go to him and make a deed of
convey
i dont know but if you ar convinc that you have no right
im not at all convinc on the contrari i feel i have no right to
give it up that i have duti both to the land and to my famili
no excus me but if you consid thi inequ is unjust why is
it you dont act accordingli
well i do act neg on that idea so far as not try to
increas the differ of posit exist between him and me
no excus me that a paradox
ye there someth of a sophistri about that veslovski agre
ah our host so your not asleep yet he said to the peasant who
came into the barn open the creak door how is it your not

when veslovski had gone out and the peasant had close the door after

convers just befor it seem to him that he had clearli
express hi thought and feel to the best of hi capac and
yet both of them straightforward men and not fool had said with on
voic that he wa comfort himself with sophistri thi
disconcert him
it just thi my dear boi on must do on of two thing either
admit that the exist order of societi is just and then stick up for
on right in it or acknowledg that you ar enjoi unjust
privileg as i do and then enjoi them and be satisfi
no if it were unjust you could not enjoi these advantag and be
satisfiedat least i could not the great thing for me is to feel that

darya alexandrovna had to consent and on the dai fix levin had readi
for hi sisterinlaw a set of four hors and relai get them
togeth from the farm and saddlehorsesnot at all a smartlook
set but capabl of take darya alexandrovna the whole distanc in a
singl dai at that moment when hors were want for the princess
who wa go and for the midwif it wa a difficult matter for levin
to make up the number but the duti of hospit would not let him
allow darya alexandrovna to hire hors when stai in hi hous
moreov he wa well awar that the twenti roubl that would be ask
for the journei were a seriou matter for her darya alexandrovna
pecuniari affair which were in a veri unsatisfactori state were
taken to heart by the levin as if thei were their own
darya alexandrovna by levin advic start befor daybreak the
road wa good the carriag comfort the hors trot along
merrili and on the box besid the coachman sat the countinghous
clerk whom levin wa send instead of a groom for greater secur
darya alexandrovna doze and wake up onli on reach the inn where

again at home look after her children she had no time to think
so now after thi journei of four hour all the thought she had
suppress befor rush swarm into her brain and she thought over
all her life as she never had befor and from the most differ
point of view her thought seem strang even to herself at first
she thought about the children about whom she wa uneasi although the
princess and kitti she reckon more upon her had promis to look
after them if onli masha doe not begin her naughti trick if grisha
isnt kick by a hors and lili stomach isnt upset again she
thought but these question of the present were succeed by question
of the immedi futur she began think how she had to get a new
flat in moscow for the come winter to renew the drawingroom
furnitur and to make her elder girl a cloak then question of the
more remot futur occur to her how she wa to place her children
in the world the girl ar all right she thought but the boi
it veri well that im teach grisha but of cours that onli
becaus i am free myself now im not with child stiva of cours
there no count on and with the help of goodnatur friend i can
bring them up but if there anoth babi come and the thought
struck her how untruli it wa said that the curs laid on woman wa
that in sorrow she should bring forth children

childthat what so intoler she thought pictur to herself
her last pregnanc and the death of the last babi and she recal
the convers she had just had with the young woman at the inn on

well did you griev veri much for her ask darya alexandrovna
why griev the old man ha grandchildren enough as it is it wa onli
a troubl no work nor noth onli a tie
thi answer had struck darya alexandrovna as revolt in spite of the
goodnatur and pleas face of the young woman but now she could
not help recal these word in those cynic word there wa inde
a grain of truth
ye altogeth thought darya alexandrovna look back over her
whole exist dure those fifteen year of her marri life

kitti ha lost her look and i when im with child becom hideou i

darya alexandrovna shudder at the mere recollect of the pain from
sore breast which she had suffer with almost everi child then the
children ill that everlast apprehens then bring them
up evil propens she thought of littl masha crime among the
raspberri educ latinit all so incomprehens and
difficult and on the top of it all the death of these children and
there rose again befor her imagin the cruel memori that alwai
tore her mother heart of the death of her last littl babi who had
di of croup hi funer the callou indiffer of all at the
littl pink coffin and her own torn heart and her lone anguish at
the sight of the pale littl brow with it project templ and the
open wonder littl mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it
wa be cover with the littl pink lid with a cross braid on it
and all thi what it for what is to come of it all that im
wast my life never have a moment peac either with child or
nurs a child forev irrit peevish wretch myself and
worri other repuls to my husband while the children ar

thei wont be abl to keep us it a drag on them as it is how is
papa who ha hardli anyth left for himself to help us so that i
cant even bring the children up by myself and mai find it hard with
the help of other peopl at the cost of humili why even if we
suppos the greatest good luck that the children dont die and i
bring them up somehow at the veri best theyll simpli be decent
peopl that all i can hope for and to gain simpli thatwhat
agoni what toil on whole life ruin again she recal
what the young peasant woman had said and again she wa revolt at
the thought but she could not help admit that there wa a grain of
brutal truth in the word
is it far now mihail darya alexandrovna ask the countinghous
clerk to turn her mind from thought that were frighten her
from thi villag thei sai it five mile the carriag drove
along the villag street and onto a bridg on the bridg wa a crowd

inquisit at the carriag all the face turn to darya
alexandrovna look to her healthi and happi make her enviou of
their enjoy of life theyr all live theyr all enjoi

women and wa drive uphil again at a trot seat comfort on the
soft spring of the old carriag while i let out as it were from
prison from the world of worri that fret me to death am onli

dont respect him he necessari to me she thought about her
husband and i put up with him is that ani better at that time i
could still have been admir i had beauti left me still darya
alexandrovna pursu her thought and she would have like to look at
herself in the lookingglass she had a travel lookingglass in her
handbag and she want to take it out but look at the back of the
coachman and the swai countinghous clerk she felt that she would
be asham if either of them were to look round and she did not take
out the glass
but without look in the glass she thought that even now it wa not
too late and she thought of sergei ivanovitch who wa alwai
particularli attent to her of stiva goodheart friend
turovtsin who had help her nurs her children through the
scarlatina and wa in love with her and there wa someon els a
quit young man whoher husband had told her it as a jokethought her
more beauti than either of her sister and the most passion and
imposs romanc rose befor darya alexandrovna imagin anna

i am but most like just as she alwai wa bright clever open to

her lip for as she ponder on anna love affair darya
alexandrovna construct on parallel line an almost ident love
affair for herself with an imaginari composit figur the ideal man
who wa in love with her she like anna confess the whole affair to
her husband and the amaz and perplex of stepan arkadyevitch at
thi avow made her smile
in such daydream she reach the turn of the highroad that led to

eleg and gorgeou peopl surround her but what struck her most
of all wa the chang that had taken place in anna whom she knew so
well and love ani other woman a less close observ not know
anna befor or not have thought as darya alexandrovna had been
think on the road would not have notic anyth special in anna
but now dolli wa struck by that temporari beauti which is onli found
in women dure the moment of love and which she saw now in anna
face everyth in her face the clearli mark dimpl in her cheek
and chin the line of her lip the smile which as it were flutter
about her face the brillianc of her ey the grace and rapid of

darya alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenu
he stood up face her
i see that she is happi he repeat and the doubt whether she were
happi sank more deepli into darya alexandrovna mind but can it
last whether we have act rightli or wrongli is anoth question but
the die is cast he said pass from russian to french and we ar
bound togeth for life we ar unit by all the ti of love that we
hold most sacr we have a child we mai have other children but the
law and all the condit of our posit ar such that thousand of
complic aris which she doe not see and doe not want to see
and that on can well understand but i cant help see them my
daughter is by law not my daughter but karenin i cannot bear thi
falsiti he said with a vigor gestur of refus and he look
with gloomi inquiri toward darya alexandrovna
she made no answer but simpli gaze at him he went on

she felt that have onc begun to speak of matter near hi heart of
which he could not speak to anna he wa now make a clean breast of
everyth and that the question of hi pursuit in the countri fell
into the same categori of matter near hi heart as the question of
hi relat with anna

that as i work i want to have a convict that what i am do will
not die with me that i shall have heir to come after meand thi i
have not conceiv the posit of a man who know that hi children

saw noth would be understood from her explan but awar that
her talk wa pleasant and her hand beauti she went on explain
more like littl penkniv veslovski said playfulli never take

anna gave a just percept smile but made no answer isnt it true
karl fedoritch that it just like littl scissor she said to the
steward
oh ja answer the german es ist ein ganz einfach ding
and he began to explain the construct of the machin
it a piti it doesnt bind too i saw on at the vienna exhibit
which bind with a wire said sviazhski thei would be more
profit in us
es kommt drauf an der prei vom draht muss ausgerechnet werden
and the german rous from hi taciturn turn to vronski da
lsst sich ausrechnen erlaucht the german wa just feel in the
pocket where were hi pencil and the notebook he alwai wrote in but
recollect that he wa at a dinner and observ vronski chilli

typhu it is not but it take a bad turn
what a piti said anna and have thu paid the due of civil to
her domest circl she turn to her own friend
it would be a hard task though to construct a machin from your
descript anna arkadyevna sviazhski said jestingli
oh no why so said anna with a smile that betrai that she knew
there wa someth charm in her disquisit upon the machin that
had been notic by sviazhski thi new trait of girlish coquettish
made an unpleas impress on dolli
but anna arkadyevna knowledg of architectur is marvel said
tushkevitch
to be sure i heard anna arkadyevna talk yesterdai about plinth
and dampcours said veslovski have i got it right
there noth marvel about it when on see and hear so much of
it said anna but i dare sai you dont even know what hous ar
made of
darya alexandrovna saw that anna dislik the tone of railleri that
exist between her and veslovski but fell in with it against her
will
vronski act in thi matter quit differ from levin he obvious
attach no signific to veslovski chatter on the contrari he
encourag hi jest
come now tell us veslovski how ar the stone held togeth
by cement of cours
bravo and what is cement
oh some sort of past no putti said veslovski rais a
gener laugh
the compani at dinner with the except of the doctor the architect
and the steward who remain plung in gloomi silenc kept up a
convers that never paus glanc off on subject fasten on
anoth and at time sting on or the other to the quick onc
darya alexandrovna felt wound to the quick and got so hot that she
posit flush and wonder afterward whether she had said
anyth extrem or unpleas sviazhski began talk of levin
describ hi strang view that machineri is simpli pernici in it
effect on russian agricultur
i have not the pleasur of know thi m levin vronski said
smile but most like he ha never seen the machin he condemn
or if he ha seen and tri ani it must have been after a queer
fashion some russian imit not a machin from abroad what sort
of view can anyon have on such a subject
turkish view in gener veslovski said turn to anna with a
smile
i cant defend hi opinion darya alexandrovna said fire up but
i can sai that he a highli cultiv man and if he were here he
would know veri well how to answer you though i am not capabl of
do so
i like him extrem and we ar great friend sviazhski said
smile goodnaturedli mai pardon il est un petit peu toqu he
maintain for instanc that district council and arbitr board
ar all of no us and he is unwil to take part in anyth
it our russian apathi said vronski pour water from an ic
decant into a delic glass on a high stem weve no sens of the
duti our privileg impos upon us and so we refus to recogn
these duti
i know no man more strict in the perform of hi duti said
darya alexandrovna irrit by vronski tone of superior
for my part pursu vronski who wa evid for some reason or
other keenli affect by thi convers such as i am i am on the
contrari extrem grate for the honor thei have done me thank to
nikolai ivanitch he indic sviazhski in elect me a justic
of the peac i consid that for me the duti of be present at the
session of judg some peasant quarrel about a hors is as
import as anyth i can do and i shall regard it as an honor if
thei elect me for the district council it onli in that wai i can pai
for the advantag i enjoi as a landown unluckili thei dont
understand the weight that the big landown ought to have in the
state
it wa strang to darya alexandrovna to hear how seren confid he
wa of be right at hi own tabl she thought how levin who
believ the opposit wa just as posit in hi opinion at hi own
tabl but she love levin and so she wa on hi side
so we can reckon upon you count for the come elect said
sviazhski but you must come a littl beforehand so as to be on the
spot by the eighth if you would do me the honor to stop with me
i rather agre with your beaufrr said anna though not quit
on the same ground as he she ad with a smile im afraid that we
have too mani of these public duti in these latter dai just as in
old dai there were so mani govern functionari that on had to
call in a functionari for everi singl thing so now everyon do
some sort of public duti alexei ha been here now six month and he
a member i do believ of five or six differ public bodi du
train que cela va the whole time will be wast on it and im afraid
that with such a multipl of these bodi theyll end in be a
mere form how mani ar you a member of nikolai ivanitch she turn
to sviazhskyov twenti i fanci
anna spoke lightli but irrit could be discern in her tone
darya alexandrovna watch anna and vronski attent detect it
instantli she notic too that as she spoke vronski face had
immedi taken a seriou and obstin express notic thi
and that princess varvara at onc made hast to chang the convers
by talk of petersburg acquaint and rememb what vronski
had without appar connect said in the garden of hi work in the
countri dolli surmis that thi question of public activ wa
connect with some deep privat disagr between anna and vronski
the dinner the wine the decor of the tabl were all veri good
but it wa all like what darya alexandrovna had seen at formal dinner
and ball which of late year had becom quit unfamiliar to her it
all had the same imperson and constrain charact and so on an
ordinari dai and in a littl circl of friend it made a disagre
impress on her
after dinner thei sat on the terrac then thei proceed to plai lawn
tenni the player divid into two parti stood on opposit side
of a tightli drawn net with gilt pole on the carefulli level and
roll croquetground darya alexandrovna made an attempt to plai but
it wa a long time befor she could understand the game and by the
time she did understand it she wa so tire that she sat down with
princess varvara and simpli look on at the player her partner
tushkevitch gave up plai too but the other kept the game up for a
long time sviazhski and vronski both plai veri well and serious
thei kept a sharp lookout on the ball serv to them and without
hast or get in each other wai thei ran adroitli up to them
wait for the rebound and neatli and accur return them over
the net veslovski plai wors than the other he wa too eager but
he kept the player live with hi high spirit hi laughter and
outcri never paus like the other men of the parti with the
ladi permiss he took off hi coat and hi solid come figur
in hi white shirtsleev with hi red perspir face and hi
impuls movement made a pictur that imprint itself vividli on
the memori
when darya alexandrovna lai in bed that night as soon as she close
her ey she saw vassenka veslovski fly about the croquet ground
dure the game darya alexandrovna wa not enjoi herself she did
not like the light tone of railleri that wa kept up all the time
between vassenka veslovski and anna and the unnatur altogeth
of grownup peopl all alon without children plai at a child
game but to avoid break up the parti and to get through the time
somehow after a rest she join the game again and pretend to be
enjoi it all that dai it seem to her as though she were act in
a theater with actor clever than she and that her bad act wa
spoil the whole perform she had come with the intent of
stai two dai if all went well but in the even dure the
game she made up her mind that she would go home next dai the
matern care and worri which she had so hate on the wai now
after a dai spent without them struck her in quit anoth light and
tempt her back to them
when after even tea and a row by night in the boat darya
alexandrovna went alon to her room took off her dress and began
arrang her thin hair for the night she had a great sens of relief
it wa posit disagre to her to think that anna wa come to
see her immedi she long to be alon with her own thought
chapter 23
dolli wa want to go to bed when anna came in to see her attir

speak of matter near her heart and everi time after a few word she
had stop afterward by ourselv well talk about everyth
iv got so much i want to tell you she said
now thei were by themselv and anna did not know what to talk about

but tell me about yourself weve a great deal to talk about and iv
had a talk with dolli did not know what to call him she felt it
awkward to call him either the count or alexei kirillovitch
with alexei said anna i know what you talk about but i want
to ask you directli what you think of me of my life
how am i to sai like that straight off i realli dont know

that your see us in the summer when you have come to us and we

it she smile well what did he talk about with you
he spoke of what i want to speak about of myself and it easi for me
to be hi advoc of whether there is not a possibl whether
you could not darya alexandrovna hesit correct improv
your posit you know how i look at it but all the same if
possibl you should get marri
divorc you mean said anna do you know the onli woman who came
to see me in petersburg wa betsi tverskaya you know her of cours
au fond cest la femm la plu deprav qui exist she had an
intrigu with tushkevitch deceiv her husband in the basest wai and
she told me that she did not care to know me so long as my posit wa
irregular dont imagin i would compar i know you darl but i
could not help rememb well so what did he sai to you she
repeat
he said that he wa unhappi on your account and hi own perhap you
will sai that it egoism but what a legitim and nobl egoism he
want first of all to legitim hi daughter and to be your husband
to have a legal right to you
what wife what slave can be so utterli a slave as i in my posit
she put in gloomili
the chief thing he desir he desir that you should not suffer
that imposs well
well and the most legitim desireh wish that your children
should have a name
what children anna said not look at dolli and half close her
ey
anni and those to come
he need not troubl on that score i shall have no more children
how can you tell that you wont
i shall not becaus i dont wish it and in spite of all her
emot anna smile as she caught the nave express of curios
wonder and horror on dolli face
the doctor told me after my ill
imposs said dolli open her ey wide
for her thi wa on of those discoveri the consequ and
deduct from which ar so immens that all that on feel for the
first instant is that it is imposs to take it all in and that on
will have to reflect a great great deal upon it
thi discoveri suddenli throw light on all those famili of on or
two children which had hitherto been so incomprehens to her
arous so mani idea reflect and contradictori emot that
she had noth to sai and simpli gaze with wideopen ey of wonder
at anna thi wa the veri thing she had been dream of but now
learn that it wa possibl she wa horrifi she felt that it wa
too simpl a solut of too complic a problem
nestc pa immor wa all she said after a brief paus
why so think i have a choic between two altern either to be
with child that is an invalid or to be the friend and companion of my
husbandpract my husband anna said in a tone intention
superfici and frivol
ye ye said darya alexandrovna hear the veri argument she had
us to herself and not find the same forc in them as befor
for you for other peopl said anna as though divin her
thought there mai be reason to hesit but for me you must
consid i am not hi wife he love me as long as he love me and
how am i to keep hi love not like thi
she move her white hand in a curv befor her waist with
extraordinari rapid as happen dure moment of excit idea
and memori rush into darya alexandrovna head i she thought
did not keep my attract for stiva he left me for other and the
first woman for whom he betrai me did not keep him by be alwai
pretti and live he desert her and took anoth and can anna
attract and keep count vronski in that wai if that is what he look
for he will find dress and manner still more attract and
charm and howev white and beauti her bare arm ar howev
beauti her full figur and her eager face under her black curl he
will find someth better still just as my disgust piti and
charm husband doe
dolli made no answer she mere sigh anna notic thi sigh
indic dissent and she went on in her armori she had other
argument so strong that no answer could be made to them
do you sai that it not right but you must consid she went on
you forget my posit how can i desir children im not speak of
the suffer im not afraid of that think onli what ar my children
to be illfat children who will have to bear a stranger name for
the veri fact of their birth thei will be forc to be asham of their
mother their father their birth
but that is just why a divorc is necessari but anna did not hear
her she long to give utter to all the argument with which she
had so mani time convinc herself
what is reason given me for if i am not to us it to avoid bring
unhappi be into the world she look at dolli but without
wait for a repli she went on
i should alwai feel i had wrong these unhappi children she said
if thei ar not at ani rate thei ar not unhappi while if thei ar
unhappi i alon should be to blame for it
these were the veri argument darya alexandrovna had us in her own
reflect but she heard them without understand them how can
on wrong creatur that dont exist she thought and all at onc the
idea struck her could it possibl under ani circumst have been
better for her favorit grisha if he had never exist and thi seem
to her so wild so strang that she shook her head to drive awai thi
tangl of whirl mad idea
no i dont know it not right wa all she said with an
express of disgust on her face
ye but you mustnt forget that you and i and besid that
ad anna in spite of the wealth of her argument and the poverti of
dolli object seem still to admit that it wa not right
dont forget the chief point that i am not now in the same posit
as you for you the question is do you desir not to have ani more
children while for me it is do i desir to have them and that a
great differ you must see that i cant desir it in my posit
darya alexandrovna made no repli she suddenli felt that she had got
far awai from anna that there lai between them a barrier of question
on which thei could never agre and about which it wa better not to
speak
chapter 24
then there is all the more reason for you to legal your posit
if possibl said dolli
ye if possibl said anna speak all at onc in an utterli
differ tone subdu and mourn
sure you dont mean a divorc is imposs i wa told your husband
had consent to it
dolli i dont want to talk about that
oh we wont then darya alexandrovna hasten to sai notic the
express of suffer on anna face all i see is that you take too
gloomi a view of thing
i not at all im alwai bright and happi you see je fai de
passion veslovski
ye to tell the truth i dont like veslovski tone said darya
alexandrovna anxiou to chang the subject
oh that nonsens it amus alexei and that all but he a boi
and quit under my control you know i turn him as i pleas it just
as it might be with your grisha dollysh suddenli chang the
subjecty sai i take too gloomi a view of thing you cant
understand it too aw i try not to take ani view of it at all
but i think you ought to you ought to do all you can
but what can i do noth you tell me to marri alexei and sai i
dont think about it i dont think about it she repeat and a
flush rose into her face she got up straighten her chest and
sigh heavili with her light step she began pace up and down the
room stop now and then i dont think of it not a dai not an
hour pass that i dont think of it and blame myself for think of
it becaus think of that mai drive me mad drive me mad she
repeat when i think of it i cant sleep without morphin but
never mind let us talk quietli thei tell me divorc in the first
place he wont give me a divorc he under the influenc of countess

left alon darya alexandrovna said her prayer and went to bed she
had felt for anna with all her heart while she wa speak to her but
now she could not forc herself to think of her the memori of home
and of her children rose up in her imagin with a peculiar charm
quit new to her with a sort of new brillianc that world of her own
seem to her now so sweet and preciou that she would not on ani
account spend an extra dai outsid it and she made up her mind that
she would certainli go back next dai
anna meantim went back to her boudoir took a wineglass and drop
into it sever drop of a medicin of which the princip ingredi
wa morphin after drink it off and sit still a littl while
she went into her bedroom in a sooth and more cheer frame of mind
when she went into the bedroom vronski look intent at her he wa
look for trace of the convers which he knew that stai so
long in dolli room she must have had with her but in her express
of restrain excit and of a sort of reserv he could find
noth but the beauti that alwai bewitch him afresh though he wa
us to it the conscious of it and the desir that it should
affect him he did not want to ask her what thei had been talk of
but he hope that she would tell him someth of her own accord but
she onli said

oblig person could not hand over the order becaus it must have
the signatur of the presid and the presid though he had not
given over hi duti to a deputi wa at the elect all these
worri negoti thi endless go from place to place and
talk with pleasant and excel peopl who quit saw the
unpleas of the petition posit but were powerless to
assist himal these effort that yield no result led to a feel
of miseri in levin akin to the mortifi helpless on experi
in dream when on tri to us physic forc he felt thi frequent
as he talk to hi most goodnatur solicitor thi solicitor did it
seem everyth possibl and strain everi nerv to get him out of
hi difficulti i tell you what you might try he said more than
onc go to soandso and soandso and the solicitor drew up a
regular plan for get round the fatal point that hinder
everyth but he would add immedi itll mean some delai
anywai but you might try it and levin did try and did go everyon
wa kind and civil but the point evad seem to crop up again in the
end and again to bar the wai what wa particularli try wa that
levin could not make out with whom he wa struggl to whose interest
it wa that hi busi should not be done that no on seem to
know the solicitor certainli did not know if levin could have
understood why just as he saw why on can onli approach the book
offic of a railwai station in singl file it would not have been so
vexati and tiresom to him but with the hindranc that confront
him in hi busi no on could explain why thei exist
but levin had chang a good deal sinc hi marriag he wa patient
and if he could not see why it wa all arrang like thi he told
himself that he could not judg without know all about it and that
most like it must be so and he tri not to fret
in attend the elect too and take part in them he tri now
not to judg not to fall foul of them but to comprehend as fulli as
he could the question which wa so earnestli and ardent absorb
honest and excel men whom he respect sinc hi marriag there

the marshal of the provinc got up thank the nobil for their
confid and shed tear the nobl gave him a loud welcom and
shook hand with him but at that instant a nobleman of sergei
ivanovitch parti said that he had heard that the committe had not
verifi the account consid such a verif an insult to the
marshal of the provinc on of the member of the committe
incauti admit thi then a small gentleman veri younglook
but veri malign began to sai that it would probabl be agreeabl to
the marshal of the provinc to give an account of hi expenditur of
the public monei and that the misplac delicaci of the member of
the committe wa depriv him of thi moral satisfact then the
member of the committe tri to withdraw their admiss and sergei
ivanovitch began to prove that thei must logic admit either that
thei had verifi the account or that thei had not and he develop
thi dilemma in detail sergei ivanovitch wa answer by the spokesman
of the opposit parti then sviazhski spoke and then the malign
gentleman again the discuss last a long time and end in
noth levin wa surpris that thei should disput upon thi subject
so long especi as when he ask sergei ivanovitch whether he
suppos that monei had been misappropri sergei ivanovitch

the sixth dai wa fix for the elect of the marshal of the
provinc
the room larg and small were full of noblemen in all sort of
uniform mani had come onli for that dai men who had not seen each
other for year some from the crimea some from petersburg some from
abroad met in the room of the hall of nobil there wa much
discuss around the governor tabl under the portrait of the tsar
the nobl both in the larger and the smaller room group
themselv in camp and from their hostil and suspici glanc
from the silenc that fell upon them when outsid approach a group
and from the wai that some whisper togeth retreat to the
farther corridor it wa evid that each side had secret from the
other in appear the noblemen were sharpli divid into two
class the old and the new the old were for the most part either in
old uniform of the nobil button up close with spur and hat
or in their own special naval cavalri infantri or offici uniform
the uniform of the older men were embroid in the oldfashion wai
with epaulet on their shoulder thei were unmistak tight and
short in the waist as though their wearer had grown out of them the
younger men wore the uniform of the nobil with long waist and broad
shoulder unbutton over white waistcoat or uniform with black
collar and with the embroid badg of justic of the peac to
the younger men belong the court uniform that here and there
brighten up the crowd
but the divis into young and old did not correspond with the
divis of parti some of the young men as levin observ belong
to the old parti and some of the veri oldest noblemen on the
contrari were whisper with sviazhski and were evid ardent
partisan of the new parti
levin stood in the smaller room where thei were smoke and take
light refresh close to hi own friend and listen to what
thei were sai he conscienti exert all hi intellig
try to understand what wa said sergei ivanovitch wa the center
round which the other group themselv he wa listen at that
moment to sviazhski and hliustov the marshal of anoth district who
belong to their parti hliustov would not agre to go with hi
district to ask snetkov to stand while sviazhski wa persuad him to
do so and sergei ivanovitch wa approv of the plan levin could not
make out why the opposit wa to ask the marshal to stand whom thei
want to supersed
stepan arkadyevitch who had just been drink and take some lunch
came up to them in hi uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamb wipe
hi lip with a perfum handkerchief of border batist
we ar place our forc he said pull out hi whisker sergei
ivanovitch
and listen to the convers he support sviazhski content
on district enough and sviazhski obvious of the opposit
he said word evid intellig to all except levin
why kostya you here too i suppos your convert eh he ad
turn to levin and draw hi arm through hi levin would have been
glad inde to be convert but could not make out what the point wa
and retreat a few step from the speaker he explain to stepan
arkadyevitch hi inabl to understand why the marshal of the
provinc should be ask to stand
o sancta simplicita said stepan arkadyevitch and briefli and
clearli he explain it to levin if as at previou elect all the
district ask the marshal of the provinc to stand then he would be
elect without a ballot that must not be now eight district had
agre to call upon him if two refus to do so snetkov might declin
to stand at all and then the old parti might choos anoth of their
parti which would throw them complet out in their reckon but if
onli on district sviazhski did not call upon him to stand snetkov
would let himself be ballot for thei were even some of them go
to vote for him and purpos to let him get a good mani vote so
that the enemi might be thrown off the scent and when a candid of
the other side wa put up thei too might give him some vote levin
understood to some extent but not fulli and would have put a few more
question when suddenli everyon began talk and make a nois and
thei move toward the big room
what is it eh whom no guarante whose what thei wont pass
him no guarante thei wont let flerov in eh becaus of the
charg against him why at thi rate thei wont admit anyon it
a swindl the law levin heard exclam on all side and he
move into the big room togeth with the other all hurri
somewher and afraid of miss someth squeez by the crowd
noblemen he drew near the high tabl where the marshal of the
provinc sviazhski and the other leader were hotli disput about

levin wa stand rather far off a nobleman breath heavili and
hoars at hi side and anoth whose thick boot were creak
prevent him from hear distinctli he could onli hear the soft
voic of the marshal faintli then the shrill voic of the malign
gentleman and then the voic of sviazhski thei were disput as far
as he could make out as to the interpret to be put on the act and
the exact mean of the word liabl to be call up for trial
the crowd part to make wai for sergei ivanovitch approach the
tabl sergei ivanovitch wait till the malign gentleman had
finish speak said that he thought the best solut would be to
refer to the act itself and ask the secretari to find the act the
act said that in case of differ of opinion there must be a ballot
sergei ivanovitch read the act and began to explain it mean but at
that point a tall stout roundshould landown with dy
whisker in a tight uniform that cut the back of hi neck interrupt
him he went up to the tabl and strike it with hi finger ring he
shout loudli a ballot put it to the vote no need for more
talk then sever voic began to talk all at onc and the tall
nobleman with the ring get more and more exasper shout more
and more loudli but it wa imposs to make out what he said
he wa shout for the veri cours sergei ivanovitch had propos but
it wa evid that he hate him and all hi parti and thi feel of
hatr spread through the whole parti and rous in opposit to it

word thei express the most implac hatr levin did not in the
least understand what wa the matter and he marvel at the passion
with which it wa disput whether or not the decis about flerov
should be put to the vote he forgot as sergei ivanovitch explain to
him afterward thi syllog that it wa necessari for the public
good to get rid of the marshal of the provinc that to get rid of the
marshal it wa necessari to have a major of vote that to get a
major of vote it wa necessari to secur flerov right to vote
that to secur the recognit of flerov right to vote thei must
decid on the interpret to be put on the act
and on vote mai decid the whole question and on must be seriou
and consecut if on want to be of us in public life conclud

chapter 32
befor vronski departur for the elect anna had reflect that
the scene constantli repeat between them each time he left home
might onli make him cold to her instead of attach him to her and
resolv to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the
part with composur but the cold sever glanc with which he had
look at her when he came to tell her he wa go had wound her
and befor he had start her peac of mind wa destroi
in solitud afterward think over that glanc which had express
hi right to freedom she came as she alwai did to the same
pointth sens of her own humili he ha the right to go awai
when and where he choos not simpli to go awai but to leav me he
ha everi right and i have none but know that he ought not to do
it what ha he done though he look at me with a cold sever
express of cours that is someth indefin impalp but it
ha never been so befor and that glanc mean a great deal she
thought that glanc show the begin of indiffer
and though she felt sure that a cold wa begin there wa
noth she could do she could not in ani wai alter her relat to
him just as befor onli by love and by charm could she keep him and
so just as befor onli by occup in the dai by morphin at

ceas to love her it is true there wa still on mean not to keep
himfor that she want noth more than hi lovebut to be nearer to
him to be in such a posit that he would not leav her that mean
wa divorc and marriag and she began to long for that and made up
her mind to agre to it the first time he or stiva approach her on

the dull rumbl in the cover entri even princess varvara plai
patienc confirm thi and anna flush hotli got up but instead

chapter 1
the levin had been three month in moscow the date had long pass on
which accord to the most trustworthi calcul of peopl learn
in such matter kitti should have been confin but she wa still
about and there wa noth to show that her time wa ani nearer than
two month ago the doctor the monthli nurs and dolli and her
mother and most of all levin who could not think of the approach
event without terror began to be impati and uneasi kitti wa the
onli person who felt perfectli calm and happi
she wa distinctli consciou now of the birth of a new feel of love
for the futur child for her to some extent actual exist alreadi
and she brood blissfulli over thi feel he wa not by now
altogeth a part of herself but sometim live hi own life
independ of her often thi separ be gave her pain but at
the same time she want to laugh with a strang new joi
all the peopl she love were with her and all were so good to her so
attent care for her so entir pleasant wa everyth
present to her that if she had not known and felt that it must all
soon be over she could not have wish for a better and pleasant
life the onli thing that spoil the charm of thi manner of life wa
that her husband wa not here as she love him to be and as he wa in
the countri
she like hi seren friendli and hospit manner in the countri
in the town he seem continu uneasi and on hi guard as though he
were afraid someon would be rude to him and still more to her at
home in the countri know himself distinctli to be in hi right
place he wa never in hast to be off elsewher he wa never
unoccupi here in town he wa in a continu hurri as though afraid
of miss someth and yet he had noth to do and she felt sorri
for him to other she knew he did not appear an object of piti on
the contrari when kitti look at him in societi as on sometim
look at those on love try to see him as if he were a stranger
so as to catch the impress he must make on other she saw with a
panic even of jealou fear that he wa far inde from be a pitiabl
figur that he wa veri attract with hi fine breed hi rather
oldfashion reserv courtesi with women hi power figur and
strike as she thought and express face but she saw him not from
without but from within she saw that here he wa not himself that
wa the onli wai she could defin hi condit to herself sometim
she inwardli reproach him for hi inabl to live in the town
sometim she recogn that it wa realli hard for him to order hi
life here so that he could be satisfi with it
what had he to do inde he did not care for card he did not go to
a club spend the time with jovial gentlemen of oblonski typesh
knew now what that meant it meant drink and go somewher
after drink she could not think without horror of where men went on
such occas wa he to go into societi but she knew he could onli
find satisfact in that if he took pleasur in the societi of young
women and that she could not wish for should he stai at home with
her her mother and her sister but much as she like and enjoi
their convers forev on the same subjectsalinenadin as the
old princ call the sister talkssh knew it must bore him what
wa there left for him to do to go on write at hi book he had
inde attempt and at first he us to go to the librari and make
extract and look up refer for hi book but as he told her the
more he did noth the less time he had to do anyth and besid
he complain that he had talk too much about hi book here and that
consequ all hi idea about it were muddl and had lost their
interest for him
on advantag in thi town life wa that quarrel hardli ever happen
between them here in town whether it wa that their condit were
differ or that thei had both becom more care and sensibl in

on the step levin wa stop by hi old servant kouzma who had been
with him befor hi marriag and now look after their household in
town
beauti that wa the left shafthors brought up from the countri
ha been badli shod and is quit lame he said what doe your honor
wish to be done
dure the first part of their stai in moscow levin had us hi own
hors brought up from the countri he had tri to arrang thi part
of their expens in the best and cheapest wai possibl but it
appear that their own hors came dearer than hire hors and thei
still hire too
send for the veterinari there mai be a bruis
and for katerina alexandrovna ask kouzma
levin wa not by now struck as he had been at first by the fact that to
get from on end of moscow to the other he had to have two power
hors put into a heavi carriag to take the carriag three mile
through the snowi slush and to keep it stand there four hour
pai five roubl everi time
now it seem quit natur
hire a pair for our carriag from the jobmast said he
ye sir
and so simpli and easili thank to the facil of town life levin
settl a question which in the countri would have call for so much
person troubl and exert and go out onto the step he call
a sledg sat down and drove to nikitski on the wai he thought no
more of monei but muse on the introduct that await him to the
petersburg savant a writer on sociolog and what he would sai to him
about hi book
onli dure the first dai of hi stai in moscow levin had been struck
by the expenditur strang to on live in the countri unproduct
but inevit that wa expect of him on everi side but by now he
had grown us to it that had happen to him in thi matter which is
said to happen to drunkardsth first glass stick in the throat the
second fli down like a hawk but after the third theyr like tini
littl bird when levin had chang hi first hundredroubl note to
pai for liveri for hi footmen and hallport he could not help
reflect that these liveri were of no us to anyonebut thei were
indubit necessari to judg by the amaz of the princess and
kitti when he suggest that thei might do without liveriesthat these
liveri would cost the wage of two labor for the summer that is
would pai for about three hundr work dai from easter to ash
wednesdai and each a dai of hard work from earli morn to late
eveningand that hundredroubl note did stick in hi throat but the
next note chang to pai for provid a dinner for their relat
that cost twentyeight roubl though it did excit in levin the
reflect that twentyeight roubl meant nine measur of oat which
men would with groan and sweat have reap and bound and thrash and
winnow and sift and sownthi next on he part with more easili
and now the note he chang no longer arous such reflect and
thei flew off like littl bird whether the labor devot to obtain
the monei correspond to the pleasur given by what wa bought with
it wa a consider he had long ago dismiss hi busi
calcul that there wa a certain price below which he could not
sell certain grain wa forgotten too the rye for the price of which
he had so long held out had been sold for fifti kopeck a measur
cheaper than it had been fetch a month ago even the consider
that with such an expenditur he could not go on live for a year
without debt that even had no forc onli on thing wa essenti to
have monei in the bank without inquir where it came from so as to
know that on had the wherewith to bui meat for tomorrow and thi
condit had hitherto been fulfil he had alwai had the monei in
the bank but now the monei in the bank had gone and he could not
quit tell where to get the next instal and thi it wa which at
the moment when kitti had mention monei had disturb him but he
had no time to think about it he drove off think of katavasov and
the meet with metrov that wa befor him
chapter 3
levin had on thi visit to town seen a great deal of hi old friend at
the univers professor katavasov whom he had not seen sinc hi
marriag he like in katavasov the clear and simplic of hi
concept of life levin thought that the clear of katavasov
concept of life wa due to the poverti of hi natur katavasov
thought that the disconnected of levin idea wa due to hi lack
of intellectu disciplin but levin enjoi katavasov clear
and katavasov enjoi the abund of levin untrain idea and
thei like to meet and to discuss
levin had read katavasov some part of hi book and he had like them
on the previou dai katavasov had met levin at a public lectur and
told him that the celebr metrov whose articl levin had so much
like wa in moscow that he had been much interest by what
katavasov had told him about levin work and that he wa come to
see him tomorrow at eleven and would be veri glad to make levin
acquaint
your posit a reform charact im glad to see said
katavasov meet levin in the littl drawingroom i heard the bell
and thought imposs that it can be he at the exact time well
what do you sai to the montenegrin now theyr a race of warrior
why what happen ask levin
katavasov in a few word told him the last piec of new from the war
and go into hi studi introduc levin to a short thickset man of
pleasant appear thi wa metrov the convers touch for a
brief space on polit and on how recent event were look at in the
higher sphere in petersburg metrov repeat a sai that had reach
him through a most trustworthi sourc report as have been utter
on thi subject by the tsar and on of the minist katavasov had
heard also on excel author that the tsar had said someth
quit differ levin tri to imagin circumst in which both
sai might have been utter and the convers on that topic
drop
ye here he written almost a book on the natur condit of the
labor in relat to the land said katavasov im not a
specialist but i as a natur scienc man wa pleas at hi not
take mankind as someth outsid biolog law but on the
contrari see hi depend on hi surround and in that
depend seek the law of hi develop
that veri interest said metrov
what i began precis wa to write a book on agricultur but
studi the chief instrument of agricultur the labor said levin
redden i could not help come to quit unexpect result
and levin began carefulli as it were feel hi ground to expound
hi view he knew metrov had written an articl against the gener
accept theori of polit economi but to what extent he could
reckon on hi sympathi with hi own new view he did not know and could
not guess from the clever and seren face of the learn man
but in what do you see the special characterist of the russian
labor said metrov in hi biolog characterist so to speak
or in the condit in which he is place
levin saw that there wa an idea underli thi question with which he
did not agre but he went on explain hi own idea that the russian
labor ha a quit special view of the land differ from that of
other peopl and to support thi proposit he made hast to add that
in hi opinion thi attitud of the russian peasant wa due to the
conscious of hi vocat to peopl vast unoccupi expans in the
east
on mai easili be led into error in base ani conclus on the
gener vocat of a peopl said metrov interrupt levin the
condit of the labor will alwai depend on hi relat to the land
and to capit
and without let levin finish explain hi idea metrov began
expound to him the special point of hi own theori
in what the point of hi theori lai levin did not understand becaus
he did not take the troubl to understand he saw that metrov like
other peopl in spite of hi own articl in which he had attack the
current theori of polit economi look at the posit of the
russian peasant simpli from the point of view of capit wage and
rent he would inde have been oblig to admit that in the
easternmuch the largerpart of russia rent wa as yet nil that for
ninetenth of the eighti million of the russian peasant wage took
the form simpli of food provid for themselv and that capit doe
not so far exist except in the form of the most primit tool yet it
wa onli from that point of view that he consid everi labor
though in mani point he differ from the economist and had hi own
theori of the wagefund which he expound to levin
levin listen reluctantli and at first made object he would have
like to interrupt metrov to explain hi own thought which in hi
opinion would have render further exposit of metrov theori
superflu but later on feel convinc that thei look at the
matter so differ that thei could never understand on anoth he
did not even oppos hi statement but simpli listen although what
metrov wa sai wa by now utterli devoid of interest for him he yet
experienc a certain satisfact in listen to him it flatter
hi vaniti that such a learn man should explain hi idea to him so
eagerli with such intens and confid in levin understand of
the subject sometim with a mere hint refer him to a whole aspect
of the subject he put thi down to hi own credit unawar that
metrov who had alreadi discuss hi theori over and over again with
all hi intim friend talk of it with special eager to everi
new person and in gener wa eager to talk to anyon of ani subject
that interest him even if still obscur to himself
we ar late though said katavasov look at hi watch directli
metrov had finish hi discours
ye there a meet of the societi of amateur todai in
commemor of the jubile of svintitch said katavasov in answer to
levin inquiri pyotr ivanovitch and i were go iv promis to
deliv an address on hi labor in zoologi come along with us it
veri interest
ye and inde it time to start said metrov come with us and
from there if you care to come to my place i should veri much like
to hear your work
oh no it no good yet it unfinish but i shall be veri glad to
go to the meet
i sai friend have you heard he ha hand in the separ report
katavasov call from the other room where he wa put on hi frock
coat
and a convers sprang up upon the univers question which wa a
veri import event that winter in moscow three old professor in the
council had not accept the opinion of the younger professor the
young on had regist a separ resolut thi in the judgment
of some peopl wa monstrou in the judgment of other it wa the
simplest and most just thing to do and the professor were split up
into two parti
on parti to which katavasov belong saw in the opposit parti a
scoundrelli betray and treacheri while the opposit parti saw in
them childish and lack of respect for the author levin
though he did not belong to the univers had sever time alreadi
dure hi stai in moscow heard and talk about thi matter and had
hi own opinion on the subject he took part in the convers that
wa continu in the street as thei all three walk to the build
of the old univers
the meet had alreadi begun round the clothcov tabl at which
katavasov and metrov seat themselv there were some halfdozen
person and on of these wa bend close over a manuscript read
someth aloud levin sat down in on of the empti chair that were
stand round the tabl and in a whisper ask a student sit near
what wa be read the student ey levin with displeasur said
biographi
though levin wa not interest in the biographi he could not help
listen and learn some new and interest fact about the life of
the distinguish man of scienc
when the reader had finish the chairman thank him and read some
vers of the poet ment sent him on the jubile and said a few word
by wai of thank to the poet then katavasov in hi loud ring voic
read hi address on the scientif labor of the man whose jubile wa
be kept
when katavasov had finish levin look at hi watch saw it wa past
on and thought that there would not be time befor the concert to
read metrov hi book and inde he did not now care to do so dure
the read he had thought over their convers he saw distinctli
now that though metrov idea might perhap have valu hi own idea
had a valu too and their idea could onli be made clear and lead to
someth if each work separ in hi chosen path and that
noth would be gain by put their idea togeth and have
made up hi mind to refus metrov invit levin went up to him at
the end of the meet metrov introduc levin to the chairman with
whom he wa talk of the polit new metrov told the chairman
what he had alreadi told levin and levin made the same remark on hi
new that he had alreadi made that morn but for the sake of varieti
he express also a new opinion which had onli just struck him after
that the convers turn again on the univers question as levin
had alreadi heard it all he made hast to tell metrov that he wa
sorri he could not take advantag of hi invit took leav and
drove to lvov

chapter 5
at the concert in the afternoon two veri interest thing were
perform on wa a fantasia king lear the other wa a quartett
dedic to the memori of bach both were new and in the new style
and levin wa eager to form an opinion of them after escort hi
sisterinlaw to her stall he stood against a column and tri to
listen as attent and conscienti as possibl he tri not to
let hi attent be distract and not to spoil hi impress by
look at the conductor in a white tie wave hi arm which alwai
disturb hi enjoy of music so much or the ladi in bonnet
with string carefulli ti over their ear and all these peopl
either think of noth at all or think of all sort of thing
except the music he tri to avoid meet music connoisseur or
talk acquaint and stood look at the floor straight befor
him listen
but the more he listen to the fantasia of king lear the further he
felt from form ani definit opinion of it there wa as it were a
continu begin a prepar of the music express of some
feel but it fell to piec again directli break into new
music motiv or simpli noth but the whim of the compos
exceedingli complex but disconnect sound and these fragmentari
music express though sometim beauti were disagre
becaus thei were utterli unexpect and not led up to by anyth
gaieti and grief and despair and tender and triumph follow on
anoth without ani connect like the emot of a madman and
those emot like a madman sprang up quit unexpectedli
dure the whole of the perform levin felt like a deaf man watch
peopl danc and wa in a state of complet bewilder when the
fantasia wa over and felt a great weari from the fruitless strain
on hi attent loud applaus resound on all side everyon got
up move about and began talk anxiou to throw some light on hi
own perplex from the impress of other levin began to walk
about look for connoisseur and wa glad to see a wellknown
music amateur in convers with pestsov whom he knew
marvel pestsov wa sai in hi mellow bass how ar you
konstantin dmitrievitch particularli sculpturesqu and plastic so to
sai and richli color is that passag where you feel cordelia
approach where woman da ewig weiblich enter into conflict with
fate isnt it
you mean what ha cordelia to do with it levin ask timidli
forget that the fantasia wa suppos to repres king lear
cordelia come in see here said pestsov tap hi finger on
the satini surfac of the program he held in hi hand and pass it to
levin
onli then levin recollect the titl of the fantasia and made hast
to read in the russian translat the line from shakespear that were
print on the back of the program
you cant follow it without that said pestsov address levin as
the person he had been speak to had gone awai and he had no on to
talk to
in the entract levin and pestsov fell into an argument upon the
merit and defect of music of the wagner school levin maintain that
the mistak of wagner and all hi follow lai in their try to take
music into the sphere of anoth art just as poetri goe wrong when it
tri to paint a face as the art of paint ought to do and as an
instanc of thi mistak he cite the sculptor who carv in marbl
certain poetic phantasm flit round the figur of the poet on the
pedest these phantom were so far from be phantom that thei
were posit cling on the ladder said levin the comparison
pleas him but he could not rememb whether he had not us the same
phrase befor and to pestsov too and as he said it he felt confus
pestsov maintain that art is on and that it can attain it highest
manifest onli by conjunct with all kind of art
the second piec that wa perform levin could not hear pestsov who
wa stand besid him wa talk to him almost all the time
condemn the music for it excess affect assumpt of
simplic and compar it with the simplic of the preraphaelit
in paint as he went out levin met mani more acquaint with
whom he talk of polit of music and of common acquaint
among other he met count bol whom he had utterli forgotten to call
upon
well go at onc then madam lvova said when he told her perhap
theyll not be at home and then you can come to the meet to fetch
me youll find me still there
chapter 6
perhap theyr not at home said levin as he went into the hall of
countess bola hous
at home pleas walk in said the porter resolut remov hi
overcoat

stroke hi hat what did i come for what have i to sai to them
as he pass through the first drawingroom levin met in the doorwai
countess bola give some order to a servant with a careworn and
sever face on see levin she smile and ask him to come into the
littl drawingroom where he heard voic in thi room there were
sit in armchair the two daughter of the countess and a moscow

chapter 17
stepan arkadyevitch affair were in a veri bad wai
the monei for twothird of the forest had all been spent alreadi and
he had borrow from the merchant in advanc at ten per cent discount
almost all the remain third the merchant would not give more
especi as darya alexandrovna for the first time that winter
insist on her right to her own properti had refus to sign the
receipt for the payment of the last third of the forest all hi salari
went on household expens and in payment of petti debt that could not
be put off there wa posit no monei
thi wa unpleas and awkward and in stepan arkadyevitch opinion
thing could not go on like thi the explan of the posit wa
in hi view to be found in the fact that hi salari wa too small the
post he fill had been unmistak veri good five year ago but it
wa so no longer
petrov the bank director had twelv thousand sventitski a compani
director had seventeen thousand mitin who had found a bank
receiv fifti thousand
clearli iv been nap and theyv overlook me stepan
arkadyevitch thought about himself and he began keep hi ey and
ear open and toward the end of the winter he had discov a veri
good berth and had form a plan of attack upon it at first from
moscow through aunt uncl and friend and then when the matter
wa well advanc in the spring he went himself to petersburg it wa
on of those snug lucr berth of which there ar so mani more
nowadai than there us to be with incom rang from on thousand
to fifti thousand roubl it wa the post of secretari of the
committe of the amalgam agenc of the southern railwai and of
certain bank compani thi posit like all such appoint
call for such immens energi and such vari qualif that it
wa difficult for them to be found unit in ani on man and sinc a
man combin all the qualif wa not to be found it wa at
least better that the post be fill by an honest than by a dishonest
man and stepan arkadyevitch wa not mere an honest
manunemphaticallyin the common accept of the word he wa an
honest manemphaticallyin that special sens which the word ha in
moscow when thei talk of an honest politician an honest writer
an honest newspap an honest institut an honest tendenc
mean not simpli that the man or the institut is not dishonest
but that thei ar capabl on occas of take a line of their own in
opposit to the author
stepan arkadyevitch move in those circl in moscow in which that
express had come into us wa regard there as an honest man and
so had more right to thi appoint than other
the appoint yield an incom of from seven to ten thousand a year
and oblonski could fill it without give up hi govern posit
it wa in the hand of two minist on ladi and two jew and all
these peopl though the wai had been pave alreadi with them stepan
arkadyevitch had to see in petersburg besid thi busi stepan
arkadyevitch had promis hi sister anna to obtain from karenin a
definit answer on the question of divorc and beg fifti roubl
from dolli he set off for petersburg
stepan arkadyevitch sat in karenin studi listen to hi report on
the caus of the unsatisfactori posit of russian financ and onli
wait for the moment when he would finish to speak about hi own
busi or about anna
ye that veri true he said when alexei alexandrovitch took off
the pincenez without which he could not read now and look
inquiringli at hi former brotherinlaw that veri true in
particular case but still the principl of our dai is freedom
ye but i lai down anoth principl embrac the principl of
freedom said alexei alexandrovitch with emphasi on the word
embrac and he put on hi pincenez again so as to read the
passag in which thi statement wa made and turn over the
beautifulli written widemargin manuscript alexei alexandrovitch
read aloud over again the conclus passag
i dont advoc protect for the sake of privat interest but for
the public weal and for the lower and upper class equal he said
look over hi pincenez at oblonski but thei cannot grasp that
thei ar taken up now with person interest and carri awai by
phrase
stepan arkadyevitch knew that when karenin began to talk of what thei
were do and think the person who would not accept hi report
and were the caus of everyth wrong in russia that it wa come
near the end and so now he eagerli abandon the principl of
freetrad and fulli agre alexei alexandrovitch paus
thoughtfulli turn over the page of hi manuscript
oh by the wai said stepan arkadyevitch i want to ask you some
time when you see pomorski to drop him a hint that i should be veri
glad to get that new appoint of secretari of the committe of the
amalgam agenc of the southern railwai and bank compani
stepan arkadyevitch wa familiar by now with the titl of the post he
covet and he brought it out rapidli without mistak
alexei alexandrovitch question him as to the duti of thi new
committe and ponder he wa consid whether the new committe
would not be act in some wai contrari to the view he had been
advoc but as the influenc of the new committe wa of a veri
complex natur and hi view were of veri wide applic he could
not decid thi straight off and take off hi pincenez he said
of cours i can mention it to him but what is your reason precis
for wish to obtain the appoint
it a good salari rise to nine thousand and my mean
nine thousand repeat alexei alexandrovitch and he frown the
high figur of the salari made him reflect that on that side stepan
arkadyevitch propos posit ran counter to the main tendenc of
hi own project of reform which alwai lean toward economi
i consid and i have embodi my view in a note on the subject
that in our dai these immens salari ar evid of the unsound
econom assiett of our financ
but what to be done said stepan arkadyevitch suppos a bank
director get ten thousandwel he worth it or an engin get
twenti thousandaft all it a grow thing you know
i assum that a salari is the price paid for a commod and it ought
to conform with the law of suppli and demand if the salari is fix
without ani regard for that law as for instanc when i see two
engin leav colleg togeth both equal well train and
effici and on get forti thousand while the other is satisfi
with two or when i see lawyer and hussar have no special
qualif appoint director of bank compani with immens
salari i conclud that the salari is not fix in accord with
the law of suppli and demand but simpli through person interest and
thi is an abus of great graviti in itself and on that react
injuri on the govern servic i consid
stepan arkadyevitch made hast to interrupt hi brotherinlaw
ye but you must agre that it a new institut of undoubt
util that be start after all you know it a grow
thing what thei lai particular stress on is the thing be carri on
honestli said stepan arkadyevitch with emphasi
but the moscow signific of the word honest wa lost on alexei
alexandrovitch
honesti is onli a neg qualif he said
well youll do me a great servic anywai said stepan arkadyevitch
by put in a word to pomorskyjust in the wai of convers
but i fanci it more in volgarinov hand said alexei
alexandrovitch
volgarinov ha fulli assent as far as he concern said stepan
arkadyevitch turn red stepan arkadyevitch redden at the mention
of that name becaus he had been that morn at the jew volgarinov
and the visit had left an unpleas recollect
stepan arkadyevitch believ most posit that the committe in
which he wa try to get an appoint wa a new genuin and
honest public bodi but that morn when volgarinov hadintention
beyond a doubtkept him two hour wait with other petition in hi
wait room he had suddenli felt uneasi
whether he wa uncomfort that he a descend of rurik princ
oblonski had been kept for two hour wait to see a jew or that for
the first time in hi life he wa not follow the exampl of hi
ancestor in serv the govern but wa turn off into a new
career anywai he wa veri uncomfort dure those two hour in
volgarinov wait room stepan arkadyevitch step jauntili about
the room pull hi whisker enter into convers with the
other petition and invent an epigram on hi posit
assidu conceal from other and even from himself the feel
he wa experienc
but all the time he wa uncomfort and angri he could not have said
whywheth becaus he could not get hi epigram just right or from
some other reason when at last volgarinov had receiv him with
exagger polit and unmistak triumph at hi humili and
had all but refus the favor ask of him stepan arkadyevitch had
made hast to forget it all as soon as possibl and now at the mere
recollect he blush
chapter 18

chapter 20
stepan arkadyevitch as usual did not wast hi time in petersburg in
petersburg besid busi hi sister divorc and hi covet
appoint he want as he alwai did to freshen himself up as he
said after the musti of moscow
in spite of it caf chantant and it omnibus moscow wa yet a
stagnant bog stepan arkadyevitch alwai felt it after live for some
time in moscow especi in close relat with hi famili he wa
consciou of a depress of spirit after be a long time in moscow
without a chang he reach a point when he posit began to be
worri himself over hi wife illhumor and reproach over hi
children health and educ and the petti detail of hi offici
work even the fact of be in debt worri him but he had onli to go
and stai a littl while in petersburg in the circl there in which he
move where peopl livedr livedinstead of veget as in
moscow and all such idea vanish and melt awai at onc like wax
befor the fire hi wife onli that dai he had been talk to
princ tchetchenski princ tchetchenski had a wife and famili
grownup page in the corp and he had anoth illegitim famili
of children also though the first famili wa veri nice too princ
tchetchenski felt happier in hi second famili and he us to take hi
eldest son with him to hi second famili and told stepan arkadyevitch
that he thought it good for hi son enlarg hi idea what would
have been said to that in moscow
hi children in petersburg children did not prevent their parent from
enjoi life the children were brought up in school and there wa
no trace of the wild idea that prevail in moscow in lvov
household for instanc that all the luxuri of life were for the
children while the parent have noth but work and anxieti here
peopl understood that a man is in duti bound to live for himself as
everi man of cultur should live
hi offici duti offici work here wa not the stiff hopeless
drudgeri that it wa in moscow here there wa some interest in
offici life a chanc meet a servic render a happi phrase a
knack of faceti mimicri and a man career might be made in a
trice so it had been with bryantsev whom stepan arkadyevitch had met
the previou dai and who wa on of the highest functionari in
govern now there wa some interest in offici work like that
the petersburg attitud on pecuniari matter had an especi sooth
effect on stepan arkadyevitch bartnyanski who must spend at least
fifti thousand to judg by the style he live in had made an
interest comment the dai befor on that subject
as thei were talk befor dinner stepan arkadyevitch said to
bartnyanski
your friendli i fanci with mordvinski you might do me a favor
sai a word to him pleas for me there an appoint i should like
to getsecretari of the agenc
oh i shant rememb all that if you tell it to me but what
possess you to have to do with railwai and jew take it as you
will it a low busi
stepan arkadyevitch did not sai to bartnyanski that it wa a grow
thingbartnyanski would not have understood that
i want the monei iv noth to live on
your live arent you
ye but in debt
ar you though heavili said bartnyanski sympathet
veri heavili twenti thousand
bartnyanski broke into goodhumor laughter
oh lucki fellow said he my debt mount up to a million and a
half and iv noth and still i can live as you see
and stepan arkadyevitch saw the correct of thi view not in word
onli but in actual fact zhivahov ow three hundr thousand and
hadnt a farth to bless himself with and he live and in style
too count krivtsov wa consid a hopeless case by everyon and yet
he kept two mistress petrovski had run through five million and
still live in just the same style and wa even a manag in the
financi depart with a salari of twenti thousand but besid
thi petersburg had physic an agreeabl effect on stepan
arkadyevitch it made him younger in moscow he sometim found a grai
hair in hi head drop asleep after dinner stretch walk slowli
upstair breath heavili wa bore by the societi of young women
and did not danc at ball in petersburg he alwai felt ten year
younger
hi experi in petersburg wa exactli what had been describ to him
on the previou dai by princ pyotr oblonski a man of sixti who had
just come back from abroad
we dont know the wai to live here said pyotr oblonski i spent the
summer in baden and you wouldnt believ it i felt quit a young man
at a glimps of a pretti woman my thought on dine and drink a
glass of wine and feel strong and readi for anyth i came home to
russiahad to see my wife and what more go to my countri place

chapter 23
in order to carri through ani undertak in famili life there must
necessarili be either complet divis between the husband and wife
or love agreement when the relat of a coupl ar vacil and
neither on thing nor the other no sort of enterpris can be
undertaken
mani famili remain for year in the same place though both husband
and wife ar sick of it simpli becaus there is neither complet
divis nor agreement between them
both vronski and anna felt life in moscow insupport in the heat and
dust when the spring sunshin wa follow by the glare of summer and
all the tree in the boulevard had long sinc been in full leaf and
the leav were cover with dust but thei did not go back to
vozdvizhensko as thei had arrang to do long befor thei went on
stai in moscow though thei both loath it becaus of late there
had been no agreement between them
the irrit that kept them apart had no extern caus and all
effort to come to an understand intensifi it instead of remov
it it wa an inner irrit ground in her mind on the convict
that hi love had grown less in hi on regret that he had put himself
for her sake in a difficult posit which she instead of lighten
made still more difficult neither of them gave full utter to their
sens of grievanc but thei consid each other in the wrong and
tri on everi pretext to prove thi to on anoth
in her ey the whole of him with all hi habit idea desir with
all hi spiritu and physic tempera wa on thinglov for
women and that love she felt ought to be entir concentr on
her alon that love wa less consequ as she reason he must
have transfer part of hi love to other women or to anoth
womanand she wa jealou she wa jealou not of ani particular woman
but of the decreas of hi love not have got an object for her
jealousi she wa on the lookout for it at the slightest hint she
transfer her jealousi from on object to anoth at on time she
wa jealou of those low women with whom he might so easili renew hi
old bachelor ti then she wa jealou of the societi women he might
meet then she wa jealou of the imaginari girl whom he might want to
marri for whose sake he would break with her and thi last form of
jealousi tortur her most of all especi as he had unwarili told
her in a moment of frank that hi mother knew him so littl that
she had had the audac to try and persuad him to marri the young
princess sorokina
and be jealou of him anna wa indign against him and found
ground for indign in everyth for everyth that wa
difficult in her posit she blame him the agon condit of
suspens she had pass in moscow the tardi and indecis of
alexei alexandrovitch her solitudesh put it all down to him if he
had love her he would have seen all the bitter of her posit
and would have rescu her from it for her be in moscow and not in
the countri he wa to blame too he could not live buri in the
countri as she would have like to do he must have societi and he had
put her in thi aw posit the bitter of which he would not
see and again it wa hi fault that she wa forev separ from
her son
even the rare moment of tender that came from time to time did not
sooth her in hi tender now she saw a shade of complac of
selfconfid which had not been of old and which exasper her
it wa dusk anna wa alon and wait for him to come back from a
bachelor dinner she walk up and down in hi studi the room where
the nois from the street wa least heard and thought over everi
detail of their yesterdai quarrel go back from the
wellrememb offens word of the quarrel to what had been the
ground of it she arriv at last at it origin for a long while she
could hardli believ that their dissens had arisen from a
convers so inoffens of so littl moment to either but so it
actual had been it all aros from hi laugh at the girl high
school declar thei were useless while she defend them he had
spoken slightingli of women educ in gener and had said that
hannah anna english protg had not the slightest need to know
anyth of physic
thi irrit anna she saw in thi a contemptu refer to her
occup and she bethought her of a phrase to pai him back for the
pain he had given her i dont expect you to understand me my
feel as anyon who love me might but simpl delicaci i did
expect she said
and he had actual flush with vexat and had said someth
unpleas she could not recal her answer but at that point with an
unmistak desir to wound her too he had said
i feel no interest in your infatu over thi girl that true
becaus i see it unnatur
the cruelti with which he shatter the world she had built up for
herself so labori to enabl her to endur her hard life the
injustic with which he had accus her of affect of
artifici arous her
i am veri sorri that noth but what coars and materi is
comprehens and natur to you she said and walk out of the
room
when he had come in to her yesterdai even thei had not refer to
the quarrel but both felt that the quarrel had been smooth over but
wa not at an end
todai he had not been at home all dai and she felt so lone and
wretch in be on bad term with him that she want to forget it
all to forgiv him and be reconcil with him she want to throw
the blame on herself and to justifi him
i am myself to blame im irrit im insan jealou i will make
it up with him and well go awai to the countri there i shall be more
at peac
unnatur she suddenli recal the word that had stung her most of
all not so much the word itself as the intent to wound her with which
it wa said i know what he meant he meantunnatur not love my
own daughter to love anoth person child what doe he know of love
for children of my love for seryozha whom iv sacrif for him
but that wish to wound me no he love anoth woman it must be so
and perceiv that while try to regain her peac of mind she had
gone round the same circl that she had been round so often befor and
had come back to her former state of exasper she wa horrifi at
herself can it be imposs can it be beyond me to control myself
she said to herself and began again from the begin he
truth he honest he love me i love him and in a few dai the
divorc will come what more do i want i want peac of mind and trust
and i will take the blame on myself ye now when he come in i will
tell him i wa wrong though i wa not wrong and we will go awai
tomorrow
and to escap think ani more and be overcom by irrit
she rang and order the box to be brought up for pack their
thing for the countri
at ten oclock vronski came in
chapter 24
well wa it nice she ask come out to meet him with a penit
and meek express
just as usual he answer see at a glanc that she wa in on of
her good mood he wa us by now to these transit and he wa
particularli glad to see it todai as he wa in a special good humor
himself
what do i see come that good he said point to the box in
the passag

to be in the countri there noth to keep you is there
it the on thing i desir ill be back directli and well talk it
over i onli want to chang my coat order some tea
and he went into hi room
there wa someth mortifi in the wai he had said come that
good as on sai to a child when it leav off be naughti and
still more mortifi wa the contrast between her penit and hi
selfconfid tone and for on instant she felt the lust of strife
rise up in her again but make an effort she conquer it and met
vronski as goodhumoredli as befor
when he came in she told him partli repeat phrase she had prepar
beforehand how she had spent the dai and her plan for go awai
you know it came to me almost like an inspir she said why
wait here for the divorc wont it be just the same in the countri i
cant wait ani longer i dont want to go on hope i dont want to
hear anyth about the divorc i have made up my mind it shall not
have ani more influenc on my life do you agre
oh ye he said glanc uneasili at her excit face
what did you do who wa there she said after a paus
vronski mention the name of the guest the dinner wa first rate
and the boat race and it wa all pleasant enough but in moscow thei
can never do anyth without someth ridicul a ladi of a sort
appear on the scene teacher of swim to the queen of sweden and
gave us an exhibit of her skill
how did she swim ask anna frown
in an absurd red costum de natat she wa old and hideou too
so when shall we go
what an absurd fanci why did she swim in some special wai then
said anna not answer
there wa absolut noth in it that just what i sai it wa
awfulli stupid well then when do you think of go
anna shook her head as though try to drive awai some unpleas
idea
when why the sooner the better by tomorrow we shant be readi the
dai after tomorrow

if so we wont go at all
but why so
i shall not go later mondai or never
what for said vronski as though in amaz why there no
mean in it
there no mean in it to you becaus you care noth for me you
dont care to understand my life the on thing that i care for here
wa hannah you sai it affect why you said yesterdai that i
dont love my daughter that i love thi english girl that it
unnatur i should like to know what life there is for me that could
be natur
for an instant she had a clear vision of what she wa do and wa
horrifi at how she had fallen awai from her resolut but even
though she knew it wa her own ruin she could not restrain herself
could not keep herself from prove to him that he wa wrong could not
give wai to him
i never said that i said i did not sympath with thi sudden
passion
how is it though you boast of your straightforward you dont
tell the truth
i never boast and i never tell li he said slowli restrain hi
rise anger it a great piti if you cant respect
respect wa invent to cover the empti place where love should be
and if you dont love me ani more it would be better and more honest
to sai so
no thi is becom unbear cri vronski get up from hi
chair and stop short face her he said speak deliber
what do you try my patienc for look as though he might have said
much more but wa restrain himself it ha limit
what do you mean by that she cri look with terror at the
undisguis hatr in hi whole face and especi in hi cruel
menac ey
i mean to sai he wa begin but he check himself i must
ask what it is you want of me
what can i want all i can want is that you should not desert me as
you think of do she said understand all he had not utter
but that i dont want that secondari i want love and there is
none so then all is over
she turn toward the door
stop stoop said vronski with no chang in the gloomi line of hi
brow though he held her by the hand what is it all about i said
that we must put off go for three dai and on that you told me i
wa ly that i wa not an honor man
ye and i repeat that the man who reproach me with have
sacrif everyth for me she said recal the word of a still
earlier quarrel that he wors than a dishonor manh a
heartless man
oh there ar limit to endur he cri and hastili let go her
hand
he hate me that clear she thought and in silenc without
look round she walk with falter step out of the room he
love anoth woman that even clearer she said to herself as she
went into her own room i want love and there is none so then all
is over she repeat the word she had said and it must be end
but how she ask herself and she sat down in a low chair befor

face and came up to her to take her to the train some noisi men were
quiet as she pass them on the platform and on whisper someth
about her to anothersometh vile no doubt she step up on the
high step and sat down in a carriag by herself on a dirti seat that
had been white her bag lai besid her shaken up and down by the
springi of the seat with a foolish smile pyotr rais hi hat
with it color band at the window in token of farewel an impud
conductor slam the door and the latch a grotesquelook ladi
wear a bustl anna mental undress the woman and wa appal
at her hideous and a littl girl laugh affectedli ran down the
platform
katerina andreevna she got them all ma tant cri the girl

anyon she got up quickli and seat herself at the opposit window of
the empti carriag a misshapenlook peasant cover with dirt in a
cap from which hi tangl hair stuck out all round pass by that
window stoop down to the carriag wheel there someth
familiar about that hideou peasant thought anna and rememb her
dream she move awai to the opposit door shake with terror the
conductor open the door and let in a man and hi wife
do you wish to get out
anna made no answer the conductor and her two fellowpasseng did
not notic under her veil her panicstricken face she went back to her
corner and sat down the coupl seat themselv on the opposit side
and intent but surreptiti scrutin her cloth both husband
and wife seem repuls to anna the husband ask would she allow
him to smoke obvious not with a view to smoke but to get into
convers with her receiv her assent he said to hi wife in
french someth about care less to smoke than to talk thei made
inan and affect remark to on anoth entir for her benefit
anna saw clearli that thei were sick of each other and hate each
other and no on could have help hate such miser
monstros
a second bell sound and wa follow by move of luggag nois
shout and laughter it wa so clear to anna that there wa noth
for anyon to be glad of that thi laughter irrit her agonizingli
and she would have like to stop up her ear not to hear it at last
the third bell rang there wa a whistl and a hiss of steam and a
clank of chain and the man in her carriag cross himself it would
be interest to ask him what mean he attach to that thought
anna look angrili at him she look past the ladi out of the
window at the peopl who seem whirl by as thei ran besid the
train or stood on the platform the train jerk at regular interv
at the junction of the rail roll by the platform past a stone
wall a signalbox past other train the wheel move more smoothli
and evenli resound with a slight clang on the rail the window wa
light up by the bright even sun and a slight breez flutter the
curtain anna forgot her fellow passeng and to the light swai of
the train she fell to think again as she breath the fresh air
ye what did i stop at that i couldnt conceiv a posit in which
life would not be a miseri that we ar all creat to be miser
and that we all know it and all invent mean of deceiv each other
and when on see the truth what is on to do
that what reason is given man for to escap from what worri him
said the ladi in french lisp affectedli and obvious pleas with
her phrase
the word seem an answer to anna thought
to escap from what worri him repeat anna and glanc at the
redcheek husband and the thin wife she saw that the sickli wife
consid herself misunderstood and the husband deceiv her and
encourag her in that idea of herself anna seem to see all their
histori and all the cranni of their soul as it were turn a light
upon them but there wa noth interest in them and she pursu
her thought
ye im veri much worri and that what reason wa given me for
to escap so then on must escap why not put out the light when
there noth more to look at when it sicken to look at it all
but how why did the conductor run along the footboard why ar thei
shriek those young men in that train why ar thei talk why ar
thei laugh it all falsehood all ly all humbug all
cruelti
when the train came into the station anna got out into the crowd of
passeng and move apart from them as if thei were leper she
stood on the platform try to think what she had come here for and
what she meant to do everyth that had seem to her possibl befor
wa now so difficult to consid especi in thi noisi crowd of
hideou peopl who would not leav her alon on moment porter ran up
to her proffer their servic then young men clack their heel
on the plank of the platform and talk loudli stare at her peopl
meet her dodg past on the wrong side rememb that she had
meant to go on further if there were no answer she stop a porter
and ask if her coachman were not here with a note from count vronski
count vronski thei sent up here from the vronski just thi minut
to meet princess sorokina and her daughter and what is the coachman
like
just as she wa talk to the porter the coachman mihail red and
cheer in hi smart blue coat and chain evid proud of have so
successfulli perform hi commiss came up to her and gave her a
letter she broke it open and her heart ach befor she had read it
i am veri sorri your note did not reach me i will be home at ten
vronski had written carelessli
ye that what i expect she said to herself with an evil smile
veri good you can go home then she said softli address mihail
she spoke softli becaus the rapid of her heart beat hinder
her breath no i wont let you make me miser she thought
menacingli address not him not herself but the power that made
her suffer and she walk along the platform
two maidserv walk along the platform turn their head
stare at her and make some remark about her dress real thei
said of the lace she wa wear the young men would not leav her in
peac again thei pass by peer into her face and with a laugh
shout someth in an unnatur voic the stationmast come up
ask her whether she wa go by train a boi sell kva never took
hi ey off her my god where am i to go she thought go
farther and farther along the platform at the end she stop some
ladi and children who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacl
paus in their loud laughter and talk and stare at her as she
reach them she quicken her pace and walk awai from them to the
edg of the platform a luggag train wa come in the platform began
to swai and she fanci she wa in the train again
and all at onc she thought of the man crush by the train the dai she
had first met vronski and she knew what she had to do with a rapid
light step she went down the step that led from the tank to the rail
and stop quit near the approach train
she look at the lower part of the carriag at the screw and chain
and the tall castiron wheel of the first carriag slowli move up
and try to measur the middl between the front and back wheel and
the veri minut when that middl point would be opposit her
there she said to herself look into the shadow of the carriag
at the sand and coal dust which cover the sleepersther in the
veri middl and i will punish him and escap from everyon and from
myself
she tri to fling herself below the wheel of the first carriag as it
reach her but the red bag which she tri to drop out of her hand
delai her and she wa too late she miss the moment she had to
wait for the next carriag a feel such as she had known when about
to take the first plung in bath came upon her and she cross
herself that familiar gestur brought back into her soul a whole
seri of girlish and childish memori and suddenli the dark that
had cover everyth for her wa torn apart and life rose up befor
her for an instant with all it bright past joi but she did not take
her ey from the wheel of the second carriag and exactli at the
moment when the space between the wheel came opposit her she drop
the red bag and draw her head back into her shoulder fell on her
hand under the carriag and lightli as though she would rise again
at onc drop on to her knee and at the same instant she wa
terrorstricken at what she wa do where am i what am i do
what for she tri to get up to drop backward but someth huge
and merciless struck her on the head and roll her on her back lord
forgiv me all she said feel it imposs to struggl a peasant
mutter someth wa work at the iron abov her and the light by
which she had read the book fill with troubl falsehood sorrow
and evil flare up more brightli than ever befor light up for her
all that had been in dark flicker began to grow dim and wa

part eight
chapter 1
almost two month had pass the hot summer wa half over but sergei
ivanovitch wa onli just prepar to leav moscow
sergei ivanovitch life had not been unev dure thi time a
year ago he had finish hi book the fruit of six year labor
sketch of a survei of the principl and form of govern in europ
and russia sever section of thi book and it introduct had
appear in period public and other part had been read by
sergei ivanovitch to person of hi circl so that the lead idea
of the work could not be complet novel to the public but still
sergei ivanovitch had expect that on it appear hi book would be
sure to make a seriou impress on societi and if it did not caus a
revolut in social scienc it would at ani rate make a great stir
in the scientif world
after the most conscienti revis the book had last year been
publish and had been distribut among the booksel
though he ask no on about it reluctantli and with feign
indiffer answer hi friend inquiri as to how the book wa
go and did not even inquir of the booksel how the book wa
sell sergei ivanovitch wa all on the alert with strain
attent watch for the first impress hi book would make in the
world and in literatur
but a week pass a second a third and in societi no impress
whatev could be detect hi friend who were specialist and
savant occasionallyunmistak from politenessallud to it the
rest of hi acquaint not interest in a book on a learn
subject did not talk of it at all and societi generallyjust now
especi absorb in other thingswa absolut indiffer in the
press too for a whole month there wa not a word about hi book
sergei ivanovitch had calcul to a niceti the time necessari for
write a review but a month pass and a second and still there wa
silenc
onli in the northern beetl in a comic articl on the singer
drabanti who had lost hi voic there wa a contemptu allus to
koznishev book suggest that the book had been long ago seen
through by everyon and wa a subject of gener ridicul
at last in the third month a critic articl appear in a seriou
review sergei ivanovitch knew the author of the articl he had met
him onc at golubtsov
the author of the articl wa a young man an invalid veri bold as a
writer but extrem defici in breed and shy in person
relat
in spite of hi absolut contempt for the author it wa with complet
respect that sergei ivanovitch set about read the articl the
articl wa aw
the critic had undoubtedli put an interpret upon the book which
could not possibl be put on it but he had select quotat so
adroitli that for peopl who had not read the book and obvious
scarc anyon had read it it seem absolut clear that the whole
book wa noth but a medlei of highflown phrase not evena
suggest by mark of interrogationus appropri and that the
author of the book wa a person absolut without knowledg of the
subject and all thi wa so wittili done that sergei ivanovitch would
not have disown such wit himself but that wa just what wa so
aw
in spite of the scrupul conscienti with which sergei
ivanovitch verifi the correct of the critic argument he did
not for a minut stop to ponder over the fault and mistak which were
ridicul but unconsci he began immedi try to recal
everi detail of hi meet and convers with the author of the
articl
didnt i offend him in some wai sergei ivanovitch wonder
and rememb that when thei met he had correct the young man about
someth he had said that betrai ignor sergei ivanovitch found
the clue to explain the articl
thi articl wa follow by a deadli silenc about the book both in
the press and in convers and sergei ivanovitch saw that hi six
year task toil at with such love and labor had gone leav no
trace
sergei ivanovitch posit wa still more difficult from the fact
that sinc he had finish hi book he had had no more literari work
to do such as had hitherto occupi the greater part of hi time
sergei ivanovitch wa clever cultiv healthi and energet and
he did not know what us to make of hi energi convers in
drawingroom in meet assembl and committeeseverywher where
talk wa possibletook up part of hi time but be us for year to
town life he did not wast all hi energi in talk as hi less
experienc younger brother did when he wa in moscow he had a great
deal of leisur and intellectu energi still to dispos of
fortun for him at thi period so difficult for him from the
failur of hi book the variou public question of the dissent
sect of the american allianc of the samara famin of exhibit
and of spiritu were definit replac in public interest by the
slavon question which had hitherto rather languidli interest
societi and sergei ivanovitch who had been on of the first to rais
thi subject threw himself into it heart and soul
in the circl to which sergei ivanovitch belong noth wa talk
of or written about just now but the servian war everyth that the
idl crowd usual doe to kill time wa done now for the benefit of
the slavon state ball concert dinner matchbox ladi
dress beer restaurantseveryth testifi to sympathi with the
slavon peopl
from much of what wa spoken and written on the subject sergei
ivanovitch differ on variou point he saw that the slavon
question had becom on of those fashion distract which succe
on anoth in provid societi with an object and an occup he
saw too that a great mani peopl were take up the subject from
motiv of selfinterest and selfadvertis he recogn that the
newspap publish a great deal that wa superflu and exagger
with the sole aim of attract attent and outbid on anoth
he saw that in thi gener movement those who thrust themselv most
forward and shout the loudest were men who had fail and were
smart under a sens of injurygener without armi minist not
in the ministri journalist not on ani paper parti leader without
follow he saw that there wa a great deal in it that wa frivol
and absurd but he saw and recogn an unmistak grow
enthusiasm unit all class with which it wa imposs not to
sympath the massacr of men who were fellow christian and of the
same slavon race excit sympathi for the suffer and indign
against the oppressor and the heroism of the servian and
montenegrin struggl for a great caus begot in the whole peopl a
long to help their brother not in word but in deed
but in thi there wa anoth aspect that rejoic sergei ivanovitch
that wa the manifest of public opinion the public had definit
express it desir the soul of the peopl had as sergei ivanovitch
said found express and the more he work in thi caus the more
incontest it seem to him that it wa a caus destin to assum
vast dimens to creat an epoch
he threw himself heart and soul into the servic of thi great caus
and forgot to think about hi book hi whole time now wa engross by
it so that he could scarc manag to answer all the letter and
appeal address to him he work the whole spring and part of the
summer and it wa onli in juli that he prepar to go awai to hi
brother in the countri
he wa go both to rest for a fortnight and in the veri heart of the
peopl in the farthest wild of the countri to enjoi the sight of
that uplift of the spirit of the peopl of which like all
resid in the capit and big town he wa fulli persuad
katavasov had long been mean to carri out hi promis to stai with
levin and so he wa go with him

so much to do with the volunt that the type wa familiar to him and
did not interest him katavasov whose scientif work had prevent
hi have a chanc of observ them hitherto wa veri much
interest in them and question sergei ivanovitch

he would be damn hi unbelief did not caus her unhappi and
she confess that for an unbeliev there can be no salvat and
love her husband soul more than anyth in the world thought with
a smile of hi unbelief and told herself that he wa absurd
what doe he keep read philosophi of some sort for all thi year
she wonder if it all written in those book he can understand
them if it all wrong why doe he read them he sai himself that he
would like to believ then why is it he doesnt believ sure from
hi think so much and he think so much from be solitari he
alwai alon alon he cant talk about it all to us i fanci hell be
glad of these visitor especi katavasov he like discuss with

dai as though he were bound to be at their servic
ye onli be like your father onli like him she said hand mitya
over to the nurs and put her lip to hi cheek
chapter 8
ever sinc by hi belov brother deathb levin had first glanc
into the question of life and death in the light of these new
convict as he call them which had dure the period from hi
twentieth to hi thirtyfourth year impercept replac hi childish
and youth beliefsh had been stricken with horror not so much of
death as of life without ani knowledg of whenc and why and how
and what it wa the physic organ it decai the
indestruct of matter the law of the conserv of energi
evolut were the word which usurp the place of hi old belief
these word and the idea associ with them were veri well for
intellectu purpos but for life thei yield noth and levin
felt suddenli like a man who ha chang hi warm fur cloak for a
muslin garment and go for the first time into the frost is
immedi convinc not by reason but by hi whole natur that he
is as good as nake and that he must infal perish miser
from that moment though he did not distinctli face it and still went
on live as befor levin had never lost thi sens of terror at hi
lack of knowledg
he vagu felt too that what he call hi new convict were not
mere lack of knowledg but that thei were part of a whole order of
idea in which no knowledg of what he need wa possibl
at first marriag with the new joi and duti bound up with it had
complet crowd out these thought but of late while he wa
stai in moscow after hi wife confin with noth to do the
question that clamor for solut had more and more often more and
more insist haunt levin mind
the question wa sum up for him thu if i do not accept the
answer christian give to the problem of my life what answer do
i accept and in the whole arsen of hi convict so far from
find ani satisfactori answer he wa utterli unabl to find
anyth at all like an answer
he wa in the posit of a man seek food in toi shop and tool
shop
instinct unconsci with everi book with everi convers
with everi man he met he wa on the lookout for light on these
question and their solut
what puzzl and distract him abov everyth wa that the major
of men of hi ag and circl had like him exchang their old belief
for the same new convict and yet saw noth to lament in thi
and were perfectli satisfi and seren so that apart from the
princip question levin wa tortur by other question too were
these peopl sincer he ask himself or were thei plai a part or
wa it that thei understood the answer scienc gave to these problem
in some differ clearer sens than he did and he assidu
studi both these men opinion and the book which treat of these
scientif explan
on fact he had found out sinc these question had engross hi mind
wa that he had been quit wrong in suppos from the recollect of
the circl of hi young dai at colleg that religion had outliv it
dai and that it wa now practic nonexist all the peopl
nearest to him who were good in their live were believ the old
princ and lvov whom he like so much and sergei ivanovitch and all
the women believ and hi wife believ as simpli as he had believ
in hi earliest childhood and ninetynin hundredth of the russian
peopl all the work peopl for whose life he felt the deepest
respect believ
anoth fact of which he becam convinc after read mani
scientif book wa that the men who share hi view had no other
construct to put on them and that thei gave no explan of the
question which he felt he could not live without answer but simpli
ignor their exist and attempt to explain other question of no
possibl interest to him such as the evolut of organ the
materialist theori of conscious and so forth
moreov dure hi wife confin someth had happen that
seem extraordinari to him he an unbeliev had fallen into
prai and at the moment he prai he believ but that moment had
pass and he could not make hi state of mind at that moment fit into
the rest of hi life
he could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth and that now
he wa wrong for as soon as he began think calmli about it it all
fell to piec he could not admit that he wa mistaken then for hi
spiritu condit then wa preciou to him and to admit that it wa
a proof of weak would have been to desecr those moment he wa
miser divid against himself and strain all hi spiritu
forc to the utmost to escap from thi condit
chapter 9
these doubt fret and harass him grow weaker or stronger from
time to time but never leav him he read and thought and the more
he read and the more he thought the further he felt from the aim he
wa pursu
of late in moscow and in the countri sinc he had becom convinc
that he would find no solut in the materialist he had read and
reread thoroughli plato spinoza kant schell hegel and
schopenhau the philosoph who gave a nonmaterialist explan
of life
their idea seem to him fruit when he wa read or wa himself
seek argument to refut other theori especi those of the
materialist but as soon as he began to read or sought for himself a
solut of problem the same thing alwai happen as long as he
follow the fix definit of obscur word such as spirit will
freedom essenc purpos let himself go into the snare of word
the philosoph set for him he seem to comprehend someth but he
had onli to forget the artifici train of reason and to turn from
life itself to what had satisfi him while think in accord with
the fix definit and all thi artifici edific fell to piec
at onc like a hous of card and it becam clear that the edific had
been built up out of those transpos word apart from anyth in
life more import than reason
at on time read schopenhau he put in place of hi will the
word love and for a coupl of dai thi new philosophi charm him
till he remov a littl awai from it but then when he turn from
life itself to glanc at it again it fell awai too and prove to be
the same muslin garment with no warmth in it
hi brother sergei ivanovitch advis him to read the theolog work
of homiakov levin read the second volum of homiakov work and in
spite of the eleg epigrammat argument style which at first
repel him he wa impress by the doctrin of the church he found
in them he wa struck at first by the idea that the apprehens of
divin truth had not been vouchsaf to man but to a corpor of
men bound togeth by loveto the church what delight him wa the
thought how much easier it wa to believ in a still exist live
church embrac all the belief of men and have god at it head
and therefor holi and infal and from it to accept the faith in
god in the creation the fall the redempt than to begin with god
a mysteri farawai god the creation etc but afterward on
read a cathol writer histori of the church and then a greek
orthodox writer histori of the church and see that the two
church in their veri concept infal each deni the author
of the other homiakov doctrin of the church lost all it charm for
him and thi edific crumbl into dust like the philosoph
edific
all that spring he wa not himself and went through fear moment of
horror
without know what i am and why i am here life imposs and
that i cant know and so i cant live levin said to himself
in infinit time in infinit matter in infinit space is form a
bubbleorgan and that bubbl last a while and burst and that
bubbl is me
it wa an agon error but it wa the sole logic result of ag
of human thought in that direct
thi wa the ultim belief on which all the system elabor by
human thought in almost all their ramif rest it wa the
preval convict and of all other explan levin had
unconsci not know when or how chosen it as anywai the
clearest and made it hi own
but it wa not mere a falsehood it wa the cruel jeer of some wick
power some evil hate power to whom on could not submit
he must escap from thi power and the mean of escap everi man had
in hi own hand he had but to cut short thi depend on evil and
there wa on meansdeath
and levin a happi father and husband in perfect health wa sever
time so near suicid that he hid the cord that he might not be tempt
to hang himself and wa afraid to go out with hi gun for fear of
shoot himself
but levin did not shoot himself and did not hang himself he went on
live
chapter 10
when levin thought what he wa and what he wa live for he could
find no answer to the question and wa reduc to despair but he left
off question himself about it it seem as though he knew both what
he wa and for what he wa live for he act and live resolut
and without hesit inde in these latter dai he wa far more
decid and unhesit in life than he had ever been
when he went back to the countri at the begin of june he went back
also to hi usual pursuit the manag of the estat hi relat
with the peasant and the neighbor the care of hi household the
manag of hi sister and brother properti of which he had the
direct hi relat with hi wife and kindr the care of hi
child and the new beekeep hobbi he had taken up that spring
fill all hi time
these thing occupi him now not becaus he justifi them to himself
by ani sort of gener principl as he had done in former dai on
the contrari disappoint by the failur of hi former effort for the
gener welfar and too much occupi with hi own thought and the
mass of busi with which he wa burden from all side he had
complet given up think of the gener good and he busi himself
with all thi work simpli becaus it seem to him that he must do what
he wa doingthat he could not do otherwis in former daysalmost from
childhood and increasingli up to full manhoodwhen he had tri to do
anyth that would be good for all for human for russia for the
whole villag he had notic that the idea of it had been pleasant
but the work itself had alwai been incoher that then he had never
had a full convict of it absolut necess and that the work that
had begun by seem so great had grown less and less till it
vanish into noth but now sinc hi marriag when he had begun
to confin himself more and more to live for himself though he
experienc no delight at all at the thought of the work he wa do
he felt a complet convict of it necess saw that it succeed
far better than in old dai and that it kept on grow more and more
now involuntarili it seem he cut more and more deepli into the soil
like a plough so that he could not be drawn out without turn asid
the furrow
to live the same famili life as hi father and forefathersthat is in
the same condit of cultureand to bring up hi children in the same
wa incontest necessari it wa as necessari as dine when on wa
hungri and to do thi just as it wa necessari to cook dinner it wa
necessari to keep the mechan of agricultur at pokrovsko go so
as to yield an incom just as incontest as it wa necessari to
repai a debt wa it necessari to keep the properti in such a condit
that hi son when he receiv it as a heritag would sai thank you
to hi father as levin had said thank you to hi grandfath for all
he built and plant and to do thi it wa necessari to look after the
land himself not to let it and to breed cattl manur the field
and plant timber
it wa imposs not to look after the affair of sergei ivanovitch
of hi sister of the peasant who came to him for advic and were
accustom to do soa imposs as to fling down a child on is
carri in on arm it wa necessari to look after the comfort of
hi sisterinlaw and her children and of hi wife and babi and it
wa imposs not to spend with them at least a short time each dai
and all thi togeth with shoot and hi new beekeep fill up
the whole of levin life which had no mean at all for him when he
began to think
but besid know thoroughli what he had to do levin knew in just
the same wai how he had to do it all and what wa more import
than the rest
he knew he must hire labor as cheapli as possibl but to hire men
under bond pai them in advanc at less than the current rate of
wage wa what he must not do even though it wa veri profit
sell straw to the peasant in time of scarciti of provend wa
what he might do even though he felt sorri for them but the tavern
and the pothous must be put down though thei were a sourc of incom
fell timber must be punish as sever as possibl but he could
not exact forfeit for cattl be driven onto hi field and though
it annoi the keeper and made the peasant not afraid to graze their
cattl on hi land he could not keep their cattl as a punish
to pyotr who wa pai a moneylend ten per cent a month he must
lend a sum of monei to set him free but he could not let off peasant
who did not pai their rent nor let them fall into arrear it wa
imposs to overlook the bailiff not have mown the meadow and
let the hai spoil and it wa equal imposs to mow those acr
where a young cops had been plant it wa imposs to excus a
labor who had gone home in the busi season becaus hi father wa
dy howev sorri he might feel for him and he must subtract from
hi pai those costli month of idl but it wa imposs not to
allow monthli ration to the old servant who were of no us for
anyth
levin knew that when he got home he must first of all go to hi wife
who wa unwel and that the peasant who had been wait for three
hour to see him could wait a littl longer he knew too that
regardless of all the pleasur he felt in take a swarm he must
forego that pleasur and leav the old man to see to the bee alon
while he talk to the peasant who had come after him to the
beehous
whether he were act rightli or wrongli he did not know and far from
try to prove that he wa nowadai he avoid all thought or talk
about it
reason had brought him to doubt and prevent him from see what
he ought to do and what he ought not when he did not think but simpli
live he wa continu awar of the presenc of an infal judg
in hi soul determin which of two possibl cours of action wa
the better and which wa the wors and as soon as he did not act
rightli he wa at onc awar of it
so he live not know and not see ani chanc of know what he
wa and what he wa live for and harass at thi lack of knowledg
to such a point that he wa afraid of suicid and yet firmli lai
down hi own individu definit path in life
chapter 11
the dai on which sergei ivanovitch came to pokrovsko wa on of
levin most pain dai it wa the veri busiest work time when
all the peasantri show an extraordinari intens of selfsacrific in
labor such as is never shown in ani other condit of life and
would be highli esteem if the men who show these qualiti
themselv thought highli of them and if it were not repeat everi
year and if the result of thi intens labor were not so simpl
to reap and bind the rye and oat and to carri it to mow the meadow
turn over the fallow thrash the seed and sow the winter cornal thi
seem so simpl and ordinari but to succe in get through it all
everyon in the villag from the old man to the young child must toil
incessantli for three or four week three time as hard as usual
live on ryebeer onion and black bread thrash and carri the
sheav at night and not give more than two or three hour in the
twentyfour to sleep and everi year thi is done all over russia
have live the greater part of hi life in the countri and in the
closest relat with the peasant levin alwai felt in thi busi
time that he wa infect by thi gener quicken of energi in the
peopl
in the earli morn he rode over to the first sow of the rye and
to the oat which were be carri to the stack and return home
at the time hi wife and sisterinlaw were get up he drank coffe
with them and walk to the farm where a new thrash machin wa to
be set work to get readi the seedcorn
he wa stand in the cool granari still fragrant with the leav of
the hazel branch interlac on the freshli peel aspen beam of the
new thatch roof he gaze through the open door in which the dry bitter
dust of the thrash whirl and plai at the grass of the thrash
floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from
the barn then at the specklyhead whitebreast swallow that flew
chirp in under the roof and flutter their wing settl in the
crevic of the doorwai then at the peasant bustl in the dark
dusti barn and he thought strang thought
why is it all be done he thought why am i stand here make
them work what ar thei all so busi for try to show their zeal
befor me what is that old matrona my old friend toil for i
doctor her when the beam fell on her in the fire he thought
look at a thin old woman who wa rake up the grain move
painfulli with her bare sunblacken feet over the uneven rough
floor then she recov but todai or tomorrow or in ten year she
wont theyll buri her and noth will be left either of her or of
that smart girl in the red jacket who with that skill soft action
shake the ear out of their husk theyll buri her and thi piebald
hors and veri soon too he thought gaze at the heavili move
pant hors that kept walk up the wheel that turn under him
and thei will buri her and fyodor the thrasher with hi curli beard
full of chaff and hi shirt torn on hi white shouldersthei will buri
him he unti the sheav and give order and shout to the
women and quickli set straight the strap on the move wheel and
what more it not them alonem theyll buri too and noth will
be left what for
he thought thi and at the same time look at hi watch to reckon how
much thei thrash in an hour he want to know thi so as to judg by
it the task to set for the dai
itll soon be on and theyr onli begin the third sheaf
thought levin he went up to the man that wa feed the machin and
shout over the roar of the machin he told him to put it in more
slowli you put in too much at a time fyodor do you seeit get
choke that why it isnt get on do it evenli
fyodor black with the dust that clung to hi moist face shout
someth in respons but still went on do it as levin did not want
him to
levin go up to the machin move fyodor asid and began feed
the corn in himself work on till the peasant dinner hour which
wa not long in come he went out of the barn with fyodor and fell
into talk with him stop besid a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on
the thrash floor for seed
fyodor came from a villag at some distanc from the on in which levin
had onc allot land to hi cooper associ now it had been
let to a former hous porter
levin talk to fyodor about thi land and ask whether platon a
welltodo peasant of good charact belong to the same villag
would not take the land for the come year
it a high rent it wouldnt pai platon konstantin dmitrievitch
answer the peasant pick the ear off hi sweatdrench shirt
but how doe kirillov make it pai
mituh so the peasant call the hous porter in a tone of
contempt you mai be sure hell make it pai konstantin dmitrievitch
hell get hi share howev he ha to squeez to get it he no merci
on a christian but uncl fokanitch so he call the old peasant
platon do you suppos hed flai the skin off a man where there
debt hell let anyon off and hell not wring the last penni out
he a man too
but why will he let anyon off
oh well of cours folk ar differ on man live for hi own
want and noth els like mituh he onli think of fill hi
belli but fokanitch is a righteou man he live for hi soul he doe
not forget god
how think of god how doe he live for hi soul levin almost
shout
why to be sure in truth in god wai folk ar differ take you
now you wouldnt wrong a man
ye ye goodby said levin breathless with excit and
turn round he took hi stick and walk quickli awai toward home
at the peasant word that fokanitch live for hi soul in truth in
god wai undefin but signific idea seem to burst out as
though thei had been lock up and all strive toward on goal thei
throng whirl through hi head blind him with their light
chapter 12
levin strode along the highroad absorb not so much in hi thought
he could not yet disentangl them as in hi spiritu condit
unlik anyth he had experienc befor
the word utter by the peasant had act on hi soul like an electr
shock suddenli transform and combin into a singl whole the
whole swarm of disjoint impot separ thought that incessantli
occupi hi mind these thought had unconsci been in hi mind
even when he wa talk about the land
he wa awar of someth new in hi soul and joyfulli test thi new
thing not yet know what it wa
not live for hi own want but for god for what god and could on
sai anyth more senseless than what he said he said that on must
not live for on own want that is that on must not live for what
we understand what we ar attract by what we desir but must live
for someth incomprehens for god whom no on can understand nor
even defin what of it didnt i understand those senseless word of
fyodor and understand them did i doubt of their truth did i
think them stupid obscur inexact no i understood him and exactli
as he understand the word i understood them more fulli and clearli
than i understand anyth in life and never in my life have i doubt
nor can i doubt about it and not onli i but everyon the whole world
understand noth fulli but thi and about thi onli thei have no
doubt and ar alwai agre
and i look out for miracl complain that i did not see a miracl
which would convinc me a materi miracl would have persuad me
and here is a miracl the sole miracl possibl continu exist
surround me on all side and i never notic it
fyodor sai that kirillov live for hi belli that comprehens
and ration all of us as ration be cant do anyth els but
live for our belli and all of a sudden the same fyodor sai that on
mustnt live for on belli but must live for truth for god and at
a hint i understand him and i and million of men men who live ag
ago and men live nowpeas the poor in spirit and the learn
who have thought and written about it in their obscur word sai
the same thingw ar all agre about thi on thing what we must
live for and what is good i and all men have onli on firm
incontest clear knowledg and that knowledg cannot be explain
by the reasonit is outsid it and ha no caus and can have no
effect
if good ha caus it is not good if it ha effect a
reward it is not good either so good is outsid the chain of
caus and effect
and yet i know it and we all know it
what could be a greater miracl than that
can i have found the solut of it all can my suffer be over
thought levin stride along the dusti road not notic the heat nor
hi weari and experienc a sens of relief from prolong
suffer thi feel wa so delici that it seem to him
incred he wa breathless with emot and incap of go
farther he turn off the road into the forest and lai down in the
shade of an aspen on the uncut grass he took hi hat off hi hot head
and lai prop on hi elbow in the lush featheri woodland grass
ye i must make it clear to myself and understand he thought
look intent at the untrampl grass befor him and follow the
movement of a green beetl advanc along a blade of couchgrass and
lift up in it progress a leaf of goatwe what have i
discov he ask himself bend asid the leaf of goatwe out
of the beetl wai and twist anoth blade of grass abov for the
beetl to cross over onto it what is it make me glad what have i
discov
i have discov noth i have onli found out what i knew i
understand the forc that in the past gave me life and now too give
me life i have been set free from falsiti i have found the master
of old i us to sai that in my bodi that in the bodi of thi grass
and of thi beetl there she didnt care for the grass she open
her wing and flown awai there wa go on a transform of
matter in accord with physic chemic and physiolog law
and in all of us as well as in the aspen and the cloud and the misti
patch there wa a process of evolut evolut from what into
whatetern evolut and struggl as though there could be ani
sort of tendenc and struggl in the etern and i wa astonish that
in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road i could not
discov the mean of life the mean of my impuls and yearn
now i sai that i know the mean of my life to live for god for my
soul and thi mean in spite of it clear is mysteri and
marvel such inde is the mean of everyth exist ye
pride he said to himself turn over on hi stomach and begin
to tie a noos of blade of grass try not to break them
and not mere pride of intellect but dul of intellect and most
of all the deceit ye the deceit of intellect the
cheat knavish of intellect that it he said to himself
and he briefli went through mental the whole cours of hi idea
dure the last two year the begin of which wa the clear
confront of death at the sight of hi dear brother hopelessli ill
then for the first time grasp that for everi man and himself too
there wa noth in store but suffer death and forget he
had made up hi mind that life wa imposs like that and that he
must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him
as the evil jest of some devil or shoot himself
but he had not done either but had gone on live think and
feel and had even at that veri time marri and had had mani joi
and had been happi when he wa not think of the mean of hi
life
what did thi mean it meant that he had been live rightli but
think wrongli
he had live without be awar of it on those spiritu truth that
he had suck in with hi mother milk but he had thought not mere
without recognit of these truth but studious ignor them
now it wa clear to him that he could onli live by virtu of the
belief in which he had been brought up
what should i have been and how should i have spent my life if i had
not had these belief if i had not known that i must live for god and
not for my own desir i should have rob and li and kill
noth of what make the chief happi of my life would have exist
for me and with the utmost stretch of imagin he could not
conceiv the brutal creatur he would have been himself if he had not
known what he wa live for
i look for an answer to my question and thought could not give an
answer to my questionit is incommensur with my question the
answer ha been given me by life itself in my knowledg of what is
right and what is wrong and that knowledg i did not arriv at in ani
wai it wa given to me as to all men given becaus i could not
have got it from anywher
where could i have got it by reason could i have arriv at know
that i must love my neighbor and not oppress him i wa told that in my
childhood and i believ it gladli for thei told me what wa alreadi
in my soul but who discov it not reason reason discov the
struggl for exist and the law that requir us to oppress all who
hinder the satisfact of our desir that is the deduct of
reason but love on neighbor reason could never discov becaus
it irrat
chapter 13
and levin rememb a scene he had late wit between dolli and
her children the children left to themselv had begun cook
raspberri over the candl and squirt milk into each other
mouth with a syring their mother catch them at these prank
began remind them in levin presenc of the troubl their mischief
gave to the grownup peopl and that thi troubl wa all for their
sake and that if thei smash the cup thei would have noth to
drink their tea out of and that if thei wast the milk thei would
have noth to eat and die of hunger
and levin had been struck by the passiv weari incredul with which
the children heard what their mother said to them thei were simpli
annoi that their amus plai had been interrupt and did not
believ a word of what their mother wa sai thei could not believ
it inde for thei could not take in the immens of all thei
habitu enjoi and so could not conceiv that what thei were
destroi wa the veri thing thei live by
that all come of itself thei thought and there noth
interest or import about it becaus it ha alwai been so and
alwai will be so and it all alwai the same weve no need to think
about that it all readi but we want to invent someth of our own
and new so we thought of put raspberri in a cup and cook
them over a candl and squirt milk straight into each other
mouth that fun and someth new and not a bit wors than
drink out of cup
isnt it just the same that we do that i did search by the aid of
reason for the signific of the forc of natur and the mean of
the life of man he thought
and dont all the theori of philosophi do the same try by the
path of thought which is strang and not natur to man to bring him
to a knowledg of what he ha known long ago and know so certainli
that he could not live at all without it isnt it distinctli to be
seen in the develop of each philosoph theori that he know
what is the chief signific of life beforehand just as posit
as the peasant fyodor and not a bit more clearli than he and is
simpli try by a dubiou intellectu path to come back to what
everyon know
now then leav the children to themselv to get thing alon and
make their crockeri get the milk from the cow and so on would thei
be naughti then why theyd die of hunger well then leav us with
our passion and thought without ani idea of the on god of the
creator or without ani idea of what is right without ani idea of
moral evil
just try and build up anyth without those idea
we onli try to destroi them becaus were spiritu provid for
exactli like the children
whenc have i that joy knowledg share with the peasant that
alon give peac to my soul whenc did i get it
brought up with an idea of god a christian my whole life fill with
the spiritu bless christian ha given me full of them and
live on those bless like the children i did not understand them
and destroi that is try to destroi what i live by and as soon as an
import moment of life come like the children when thei ar cold
and hungri i turn to him and even less than the children when their
mother scold them for their childish mischief do i feel that my
childish effort at wanton mad ar reckon against me
ye what i know i know not by reason but it ha been given to me
reveal to me and i know it with my heart by faith in the chief
thing taught by the church
the church the church levin repeat to himself he turn over on
the other side and lean on hi elbow fell to gaze into the
distanc at a herd of cattl cross over to the river
but can i believ in all the church teach he thought try
himself and think of everyth that could destroi hi present
peac of mind intention he recal all those doctrin of the
church which had alwai seem most strang and had alwai been a
stumbl block to him
the creation but how did i explain exist by exist by
noth the devil and sin but how do i explain evil the
aton
but i know noth noth and i can know noth but what ha been
told to me and all men
and it seem to him that there wa not a singl articl of faith of
the church which could destroi the chief thingfaith in god in
good as the on goal of man destini
under everi articl of faith of the church could be put the faith in
the servic of truth instead of on desir and each doctrin did
not simpli leav that faith unshaken each doctrin seem essenti to
complet that great miracl continu manifest upon earth that made
it possibl for each man and million of differ sort of men wise
men and imbecil old men and childrenal men peasant lvov kitti
beggar and king to understand perfectli the same on thing and to
build up therebi that life of the soul which alon is worth live and
which alon is preciou to us
ly on hi back he gaze up now into the high cloudless sky do i
not know that that is infinit space and that it is not a round arch
but howev i screw up my ey and strain my sight i cannot see it
not round and not bound and in spite of my know about infinit
space i am incontest right when i see a solid blue dome and more
right than when i strain my ey to see beyond it
levin ceas think and onli as it were listen to mysteri
voic that seem talk joyfulli and earnestli within him
can thi be faith he thought afraid to believ in hi happi
my god i thank thee he said gulp down hi sob and with both
hand brush awai the tear that fill hi ey
chapter 14
levin look befor him and saw a herd of cattl then he caught sight
of hi trap with raven in the shaft and the coachman who drive up
to the herd said someth to the herdsman then he heard the rattl
of the wheel and the snort of the sleek hors close by him but he wa
so buri in hi thought that he did not even wonder why the coachman
had come for him
he onli thought of that when the coachman had driven quit up to him
and shout to him the mistress sent me your brother ha come and
some gentleman with him
levin got into the trap and took the rein as though just rous out
of sleep for a long while levin could not collect hi faculti he
stare at the sleek hors fleck with lather between hi haunch and
on hi neck where the har rub stare at ivan the coachman
sit besid him and rememb that he wa expect hi brother
thought that hi wife wa most like uneasi at hi long absenc and
tri to guess who wa the visitor who had come with hi brother and
hi brother and hi wife and the unknown guest seem to him now quit
differ from befor he fanci that now hi relat with all men
would be differ
with my brother there will be none of that aloof there alwai us
to be between us there will be no disput with kitti there shall
never be quarrel with the visitor whoever he mai be i will be
friendli and nice with the servant with ivan it will all be
differ
pull the stiff rein and hold in the good hors that snort with
impati and seem beg to be let go levin look round at ivan
sit besid him not know what to do with hi unoccupi hand
continu press down hi shirt as it puf out and he tri to
find someth to start a convers about with him he would have
said that ivan had pull the saddlegirth up too high but that wa
like blame and he long for friendli warm talk noth els
occur to him
your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump said the
coachman pull the rein levin held
pleas dont touch and dont teach me said levin anger by thi
interfer now as alwai interfer made him angri and he felt
sorrowfulli at onc how mistaken had been hi supposit that hi
spiritu condit could immedi chang him in contact with
realiti
he wa not a quarter of a mile from home when he saw grisha and tanya
run to meet him
uncl kostya mamma come and grandfath and sergei ivanovitch
and someon els thei said clamber up into the trap
who is he
an awfulli terribl person and he doe like thi with hi arm said
tanya get up in the trap and mimick katavasov
old or young ask levin laugh remind of someon he did not
know whom by tanya perform
oh i hope it not a tiresom person thought levin
as soon as he turn at a bend in the road and saw the parti come
levin recogn katavasov in a straw hat walk along swing hi
arm just as tanya had shown him katavasov wa veri fond of discuss
metaphys have deriv hi notion from natur scienc writer
who had never studi metaphys and in moscow levin had had mani
argument with him of late
and on of these argument in which katavasov had obvious consid
that he came off victori wa the first thing levin thought of as he
recogn him
no whatev i do i wont argu and give utter to my idea
lightli he thought
get out of the trap and greet hi brother and katavasov levin
ask about hi wife
she ha taken mitya to kolok a cops near the hous she meant to
have him out there becaus it so hot indoor said dolli levin had
alwai advis hi wife not to take the babi to the wood think it
unsaf and he wa not pleas to hear thi
she rush about from place to place with him said the princ
smile i advis her to try put him in the ic cellar
she meant to come to the beehous she thought you would be there we
ar go there said dolli
well and what ar you do said sergei ivanovitch fall back
from the rest and walk besid him
oh noth special busi as usual with the land answer levin
well and what about you come for long we have been expect you
for such a long time
onli for a fortnight iv a great deal to do in moscow
at these word the brother ey met and levin in spite of the
desir he alwai had stronger than ever just now to be on
affection and still more open term with hi brother felt an
awkward in look at him he drop hi ey and did not know
what to sai
cast over the subject of convers that would be pleasant to
sergei ivanovitch and would keep him off the subject of the servian
war and the slavon question at which he had hint by the allus
to what he had to do in moscow levin began to talk of sergei
ivanovitch book
well have there been review of your book he ask
sergei ivanovitch smile at the intent charact of the question
no on is interest in that now and i less than anyon he said
just look darya alexandrovna we shall have a shower he ad
point with a sunshad at the white rain cloud that show abov the
aspen treetop
and these word were enough to reestablish again between the brother
that tonehardli hostil but chillywhich levin had been so long to
avoid
levin went up to katavasov
it wa jolli of you to make up your mind to come he said to him
iv been mean to a long while now we shall have some discuss
well see to that have you been read spencer
no iv not finish read him said levin but i dont need him
now
how that that interest why so
i mean that im fulli convinc that the solut of the problem that
interest me i shall never find in him and hi like now
but katavasov seren and goodhumor express suddenli struck him
and he felt such tender for hi own happi mood which he wa
unmistak disturb by thi convers that he rememb hi

chapter 15
do you know kostya with whom sergei ivanovitch travel on hi wai
here said dolli dole out cucumb and honei to the children
with vronski he go to servia
and not alon he take a squadron out with him at hi own
expens said katavasov
that the right thing for him said levin ar volunt still
go out then he ad glanc at sergei ivanovitch
sergei ivanovitch did not answer he wa carefulli with a blunt knife
get a live bee cover with sticki honei out of a cup full of white
honeycomb
i should think so you should have seen what wa go on at the
station yesterdai said katavasov bite with a juici sound into a
cucumb
well what is on to make of it for merci sake do explain to me
sergei ivanovitch where ar all those volunt go whom ar thei
fight with ask the old princ unmistak take up a
convers that had sprung up in levin absenc
with the turk sergei ivanovitch answer smile seren as he
extric the bee dark with honei and helplessli kick and put it
with the knife on a stout aspen leaf
but who ha declar war on the turksivan ivanovitch ragozov and
countess lidia ivanovna assist by madam stahl
no on ha declar war but peopl sympath with their neighbor
suffer and ar eager to help them said sergei ivanovitch
but the princ is not speak of help said levin come to the
assist of hi fatherinlaw but of war the princ sai that
privat person cannot take part in war without the permiss of the
govern
kostya mind that a bee realli theyll sting us said dolli
wave awai a wasp
but that not a bee it a wasp said levin
well now well what your own theori katavasov said to levin with
a smile distinctli challeng him to a discuss why have not
privat person the right to do so
oh my theori thi war is on on side such a beastli cruel and
aw thing that no on man not to speak of a christian can
individu take upon himself the respons of begin war
that can onli be done by a govern which is call upon to do thi
and is driven inevit into war on the other hand both polit
scienc and common sens teach us that in matter of state and
especi in the matter of war privat citizen must forego their
person individu will
sergei ivanovitch and katavasov had their repli readi and both began
speak at the same time
but the point is my dear fellow that there mai be case when the
govern doe not carri out the will of the citizen and then the
public assert it will said katavasov
but evid sergei ivanovitch did not approv of thi answer hi
brow contract at katavasov word and he said someth els
you dont put the matter in it true light there is no question here
of a declar of war but simpli the express of a human christian
feel our brother on with us in religion and in race ar be
massacr even suppos thei were not our brother nor
fellowchristian but simpli children women old peopl feel is
arous and russian go eagerli to help in stop these atroc
fanci if you were go along the street and saw drunken men beat a
woman or a childi imagin you would not stop to inquir whether war
had been declar on the men but would throw yourself on them and
protect the victim
but i should not kill them said levin
ye you would kill them
i dont know if i saw that i might give wai to my impuls of the
moment but i cant sai beforehand and such a momentari impuls there
is not and there cannot be in the case of the oppress of the
slavon peopl
possibl for you there is not but for other there is said sergei
ivanovitch frown with displeasur there ar tradit still
extant among the peopl of slav of the true faith suffer under the
yoke of the unclean son of hagar the peopl have heard of the
suffer of their brethren and have spoken
perhap so said levin evas but i dont see it im on of the
peopl myself and i dont feel it
here am i too said the old princ iv been stai abroad and
read the paper and i must own up to the time of the bulgarian
atroc i couldnt make out why it wa all the russian were all of
a sudden so fond of their slavon brethren while i didnt feel the
slightest affect for them i wa veri much upset thought i wa a
monster or that it wa the influenc of carlsbad on me but sinc i
have been here my mind been set at rest i see that there ar peopl
besid me whore onli interest in russia and not in their slavon
brethren here konstantin too
person opinion mean noth in such a case said sergei
ivanovitch it not a matter of person opinion when all russiath
whole peopleha express it will
but excus me i dont see that the peopl dont know anyth about
it if you come to that said the old princ
oh papa how can you sai that and last sundai in church said
dolli listen to the convers pleas give me a cloth she
said to the old man who wa look at the children with a smile
why it not possibl that all
but what wa it in church on sundai the priest had been told to read
that he read it thei didnt understand a word of it then thei were
told that there wa to be a collect for a piou object in church
well thei pull out their halfpenc and gave them but what for thei
couldnt sai
the peopl cannot help know the sens of their own destini is
alwai in the peopl and at such moment as the present that sens
find utter said sergei ivanovitch with convict glanc at
the old beekeep
the handsom old man with black grizzl beard and thick silveri hair
stood motionless hold a cup of honei look down from the height
of hi tall figur with friendli seren at the gentlefolk obvious
understand noth of their convers and not care to
understand it
that so no doubt he said with a signific shake of hi head at
sergei ivanovitch word
here then ask him he know noth about it and think noth
said levin have you heard about the war mihalitch he said turn
to him what thei read in the church what do you think about it
ought we to fight for the christian
what should we think alexand nikolaevitch our emperor ha thought
for us he think for us inde in all thing it clearer for him to
see shall i bring a bit more bread give the littl lad some more he
said address darya alexandrovna and point to grisha who had
finish hi crust
i dont need to ask said sergei ivanovitch we have seen and ar
see hundr and hundr of peopl who give up everyth to serv
a just caus come from everi part of russia and directli and clearli
express their thought and aim thei bring their halfpenc or go

neerdowel who ar alwai readi to go anywhereto pogatchev
band to khiva to servia

the best repres of the peopl said sergei ivanovitch with
as much irrit as if he were defend the last penni of hi
fortun and what of the subscript in thi case it is a whole
peopl directli express their will
that word peopl is so vagu said levin parish clerk teacher
and on in a thousand of the peasant mayb know what it all about
the rest of the eighti million like mihalitch far from express
their will havent the faintest idea what there is for them to express
their will about what right have we to sai that thi is the peopl
will
chapter 16
sergei ivanovitch be practic in argument did not repli but at
onc turn the convers to anoth aspect of the subject
oh if you want to learn the spirit of the peopl by arithmet
comput of cours it veri difficult to arriv at it and vote
ha not been introduc among us and cannot be introduc for it doe
not express the will of the peopl but there ar other wai of
reach that it is felt in the air it is felt by the heart i wont
speak of those deep current which ar astir in the still ocean of the
peopl and which ar evid to everi unprejud man let us look at
societi in the narrow sens all the most divers section of the
educ public hostil befor ar merg in on everi divis is
at an end all the public organ sai the same thing over and over
again all feel the mighti torrent that ha overtaken them and is
carri them in on direct
ye all the newspap do sai the same thing said the princ
that true but so it is the same thing that all the frog croak
befor a storm on can hear noth for them
frog or no frog im not the editor of a paper and i dont want to
defend them but i am speak of the unanim in the intellectu
world said sergei ivanovitch address hi brother levin would
have answer but the old princ interrupt him
well about that unanim that anoth thing on mai sai said
the princ there my soninlaw stepan arkadyevitch you know him
he got a place now on the committe of a commiss and someth or
other i dont rememb onli there noth to do in itwhi dolli
it no secretand a salari of eight thousand you try ask him
whether hi post is of us hell prove to you that it most
necessari and he a truth man too but there no refus to
believ in the util of eight thousand roubl
ye he ask me to give a messag to darya alexandrovna about the
post said sergei ivanovitch reluctantli feel the princ remark
to be illtim
so it is with the unanim of the press that been explain to me
as soon as there war their incom ar doubl how can thei help
believ in the destini of the peopl and the slavon race and
all that
i dont care for mani of the paper but that unjust said sergei
ivanovitch
i would onli make on condit pursu the old princ alphons
karr said a capit thing befor the war with prussia you consid
war to be inevit veri good let everyon who advoc war be
enrol in a special regiment of advanceguard for the front of
everi storm of everi attack to lead them all
a nice lot the editor would make said katavasov with a loud roar
as he pictur the editor he knew in thi pick legion
but theyd run said dolli theyd onli be in the wai
oh if thei ran awai then wed have grapeshot or cossack with whip
behind them said the princ
but that a joke and a poor on too if youll excus my sai so
princ said sergei ivanovitch
i dont see that it wa a joke that levin wa begin but
sergei ivanovitch interrupt him
everi member of societi is call upon to do hi own special work
said he and men of thought ar do their work when thei express
public opinion and the singleheart and full express of public
opinion is the servic of the press and a phenomenon to rejoic us at
the same time twenti year ago we should have been silent but now we
have heard the voic of the russian peopl which is readi to rise as
on man and readi to sacrific itself for it oppress brethren that
is a great step and a proof of strength
but it not onli make a sacrific but kill turk said levin
timidli the peopl make sacrific and ar readi to make sacrific
for their soul but not for murder he ad instinct connect
the convers with the idea that had been absorb hi mind
for their soul that a most puzzl express for a natur
scienc man do you understand what sort of thing is the soul said
katavasov smile
oh you know
no by god i havent the faintest idea said katavasov with a loud
roar of laughter
i bring not peac but a sword sai christ sergei ivanovitch
rejoin for hi part quot as simpli as though it were the easiest
thing to understand the veri passag that had alwai puzzl levin
most
that so no doubt the old man repeat again he wa stand near
them and respond to a chanc glanc turn in hi direct
ah my dear fellow your defeat utterli defeat cri
katavasov goodhumoredli
levin redden with vexat not at be defeat but at have
fail to control himself and be drawn into argument
no i cant argu with them he thought thei wear impenetr
armor while im nake
he saw that it wa imposs to convinc hi brother and katavasov
and he saw even less possibl of himself agre with them what
thei advoc wa the veri pride of intellect that had almost been hi
ruin he could not admit that some dozen of men among them hi
brother had the right on the ground of what thei were told by some
hundr of glib volunt swarm to the capit to sai that thei
and the newspap were express the will and feel of the peopl
and a feel which wa express in vengeanc and murder he could not
admit thi becaus he neither saw the express of such feel in
the peopl among whom he wa live nor found them in himself and he
could not but consid himself on of the person make up the russian
peopl and most of all becaus he like the peopl did not know and
could not know what is for the gener good though he knew beyond a
doubt that thi gener good could be attain onli by the strict
observ of that law of right and wrong which ha been reveal to
everi man and therefor he could not wish for war or advoc war for
ani gener object whatev he said as mihalitch did and the peopl
who had express their feel in the tradit invit of the
varyagi be princ and rule over us gladli we promis complet
submiss all the labor all humili all sacrific we take
upon ourselv but we will not judg and decid and now accord
to sergei ivanovitch account the peopl had foregon thi privileg
thei had bought at such a costli price
he want to sai too that if public opinion were an infal guid
then why were not revolut and the commun as law as the movement
in favor of the slavon peopl but these were mere thought that
could settl noth on thing could be seen beyond doubtthat wa
that at the actual moment the discuss wa irrit sergei
ivanovitch and so it wa wrong to continu it and levin ceas
speak and then call the attent of hi guest to the fact that
the storm cloud were gather and that thei had better be go home
befor it rain
chapter 17
the old princ and sergei ivanovitch got into the trap and drove off
the rest of the parti hasten homeward on foot
but the stormcloud turn white and then black move down so
quickli that thei had to quicken their pace to get home befor the
rain the foremost cloud lower and black as sootladen smoke
rush with extraordinari swift over the sky thei were still two
hundr pace from home and a gust of wind had alreadi blown up and
everi second the downpour might be look for
the children ran ahead with frighten and gleeful shriek darya
alexandrovna struggl painfulli with her skirt that clung round her
leg wa not walk but run her ey fix on the children the
men of the parti hold their hat on strode with long step besid
her thei were just at the step when a big drop fell splash on the

levin snatch up the rug and ran toward the cops
in that brief interv of time the storm cloud had move on cover
the sun so complet that it wa dark as an eclips stubbornli as

that strove to tear the wrap awai from him levin wa move up to the
cops and had just caught sight of someth white behind the oak tree
when there wa a sudden flash the whole earth seem on fire and the
vault of heaven seem crash overhead open hi blind ey
levin gaze through the thick veil of rain that separ him now from
the cops and to hi horror the first thing he saw wa the green crest
of the familiar oaktre in the middl of the cops uncannili chang
it posit can it have been struck levin hardli had time to think
when move more and more rapidli the oak tree vanish behind the
other tree and he heard the crash of the great tree fall upon the
other
the flash of lightn the crash of thunder and the instantan
chill that ran through him were all merg for levin in on sens of
terror
my god my god not on them he said
and though he thought at onc how senseless wa hi prayer that thei
should not have been kill by the oak which had fallen now he
repeat it know that he could do noth better than utter thi
senseless prayer
run up to the place where thei usual went he did not find them
there

dure the whole of that dai in the extrem differ convers
in which he took part onli as it were with the top layer of hi mind
in spite of the disappoint of not find the chang he expect in
himself levin had been all the while joyfulli consciou of the ful
of hi heart
after the rain it wa too wet to go for a walk besid the storm
cloud still hung about the horizon and gather here and there black
and thunderi on the rim of the sky the whole parti spent the rest of
the dai in the hous
no more discuss sprang up on the contrari after dinner everyon
wa in the most amiabl frame of mind
at first katavasov amus the ladi by hi origin joke which
alwai pleas peopl on their first acquaint with him then sergei
ivanovitch induc him to tell them about the veri interest
observ he had made on the habit and characterist of common
housefli and their life sergei ivanovitch too wa in good
spirit and at tea hi brother drew him on to explain hi view of the
futur of the eastern question and he spoke so simpli and so well
that everyon listen eagerli
kitti wa the onli on who did not hear it allsh wa summon to give
mitya hi bath
a few minut after kitti had left the room she sent for levin to come
to the nurseri
leav hi tea and regretfulli interrupt the interest
convers and at the same time uneasili wonder why he had been
sent for as thi onli happen on import occas levin went to
the nurseri
although he had been much interest by sergei ivanovitch view of
the new epoch in histori that would be creat by the emancip of
forti million of men of slavon race act with russia a concept
quit new to him and although he wa disturb by uneasi wonder at
be sent for by kitti as soon as he came out of the drawingroom and
wa alon hi mind revert at onc to the thought of the morn
and all the theori of the signific of the slav element in the
histori of the world seem to him so trivial compar with what wa
pass in hi own soul that he instantli forgot it all and drop
back into the same frame of mind that he had been in that morn
he did not as he had done at other time recal the whole train of
thoughtthat he did not need he fell back at onc into the feel
which had guid him which wa connect with those thought and he
found that feel in hi soul even stronger and more definit than
befor he did not as he had had to do with previou attempt to find
comfort argument need to reviv a whole chain of thought to find
the feel now on the contrari the feel of joi and peac wa
keener than ever and thought could not keep pace with feel
he walk across the terrac and look at two star that had come out
in the darken sky and suddenli he rememb ye look at the
sky i thought that the dome that i see is not a decept and then i
thought someth i shirk face someth he muse but whatev
it wa there can be no disprov it i have but to think and all
will come clear
just as he wa go into the nurseri he rememb what it wa he had
shirk face it wa that if the chief proof of the divin wa hi
revel of what is right how is it thi revel is confin to
the christian church alon what relat to thi revel have the
belief of the buddhist mohammedan who preach and did good too
it seem to him that he had an answer to thi question but he had not
time to formul it to himself befor he went into the nurseri
kitti wa stand with her sleev tuck up over the babi in the
bath hear her husband footstep she turn toward him summon
him to her with her smile with on hand she wa support the fat
babi that lai float and sprawl on it back while with the other
she squeez the spong over him
come look look she said when her husband came up to her agafea
mihalovna right he know us
mitya had on that dai given unmistak incontest sign of
recogn all hi friend
as soon as levin approach the bath the experi wa tri and it
wa complet success the cook sent for with thi object bent
over the babi he frown and shook hi head disapprovingli kitti bent
down to him he gave her a beam smile prop hi littl hand on
the spong and chirrup make such a queer littl content sound
with hi lip that kitti and the nurs were not alon in their
admir levin too wa surpris and delight
the babi wa taken out of the bath drench with water wrap in
towel dri and after a pierc scream hand to hi mother
well i am glad you ar begin to love him said kitti to her
husband when she had settl herself comfort in her usual place
with the babi at her breast i am so glad it had begun to distress
me you said you had no feel for him
no did i sai that i onli said i wa disappoint
what disappoint in him
not disappoint in him but in my own feel i had expect more i
had expect a rush of new delight emot to come as a surpris
and then instead of thatdisgust piti
she listen attent look at him over the babi while she put
back on her slender finger the ring she had taken off while give
mitya hi bath
and most of all at there be far more apprehens and piti than
pleasur todai after that fright dure the storm i understand how i
love him
kitti smile wa radiant
were you veri much frighten she said so wa i too but i feel it
more now that it over im go to look at the oak how nice
katavasov is and what a happi dai weve had altogeth and your so
nice with sergei ivanovitch when you care to be well go back to
them it alwai so hot and steami here after the bath
chapter 19
go out of the nurseri and be again alon levin went back at onc
to the thought in which there wa someth not clear
instead of go into the drawingroom where he heard voic he
stop on the terrac and lean hi elbow on the parapet he gaze
up at the sky
it wa quit dark now and in the south where he wa look there
were no cloud the storm had drift on to the opposit side of the
sky and there were flash of lightn and distant thunder from that
quarter levin listen to the monoton drip from the lime tree in
the garden and look at the triangl of star he knew so well and
the milki wai with it branch that ran through it midst at each
flash of lightn the milki wai and even the bright star vanish
but as soon as the lightn di awai thei reappear in their place
as though some hand had flung them back with care aim
well what is it perplex me levin said to himself feel
beforehand that the solut of hi difficulti wa readi in hi soul
though he did not know it yet ye the on unmistak
incontest manifest of the divin is the law of right and
wrong which ha come into the world by revel and which i feel in
myself and in the recognit of whichi dont make myself but
whether i will or noti am made on with other men in on bodi of
believ which is call the church well but the jew the
mohammedan the confucian the buddhistswhat of them he put to
himself the question he had fear to face can these hundr of
million of men be depriv of that highest bless without which life
ha no mean he ponder a moment but immedi correct
himself but what am i question he said to himself i am
question the relat to divin of all the differ religion of
all mankind i am question the univers manifest of god to all
the world with all those misti blur what am i about to me
individu to my heart ha been reveal a knowledg beyond all
doubt and unattain by reason and here i am obstin try to
express that knowledg in reason and word
dont i know that the star dont move he ask himself gaze at
the bright planet which had shift it posit up to the topmost twig
of the birchtre but look at the movement of the star i cant
pictur to myself the rotat of the earth and im right in sai
that the star move
and could the astronom have understood and calcul anyth if
thei had taken into account all the complic and vari motion of
the earth all the marvel conclus thei have reach about the
distanc weight movement and deflect of the heavenli bodi
ar onli found on the appar motion of the heavenli bodi about a
stationari earth on that veri motion i see befor me now which ha
been so for million of men dure long ag and wa and will be
alwai alik and can alwai be trust and just as the conclus of
the astronom would have been vain and uncertain if not found on
observ of the seen heaven in relat to a singl meridian and
a singl horizon so would my conclus be vain and uncertain if not
found on that concept of right which ha been and will be alwai
alik for all men which ha been reveal to me as a christian and
which can alwai be trust in my soul the question of other religion
and their relat to divin i have no right to decid and no
possibl of decid
oh you havent gone in then he heard kitti voic all at onc as
she came by the same wai to the drawingroom
what is it your not worri about anyth she said look
intent at hi face in the starlight
but she could not have seen hi face if a flash of lightn had not
hidden the star and reveal it in that flash she saw hi face
distinctli and see him calm and happi she smile at him
she understand he thought she know what im think about
shall i tell her or not ye ill tell her but at the moment he wa
about to speak she began speak
kostya do someth for me she said go into the corner room and
see if theyv made it all right for sergei ivanovitch i cant veri
well see if theyv put the new wash stand in it
veri well ill go directli said levin stand up and kiss her
no id better not speak of it he thought when she had gone in
befor him it is a secret for me alon of vital import for me
and not to be put into word
thi new feel ha not chang me ha not made me happi and
enlighten all of a sudden as i had dream just like the feel
for my child there wa no surpris in thi either faithor not
faithi dont know what it isbut thi feel ha come just as
impercept through suffer and ha taken firm root in my soul
i shall go on in the same wai lose my temper with ivan the
coachman fall into angri discuss express my opinion
tactlessli there will be still the same wall between the holi of
holi of my soul and other peopl even my wife i shall still go on
scold her for my own terror and be remors for it i shall
still be as unabl to understand with my reason why i prai and i shall
still go on prai but my life now my whole life apart from anyth
that can happen to me everi minut of it is no more meaningless as it
wa befor but it ha the posit mean of good which i have
