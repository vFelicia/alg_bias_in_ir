heart of petersburg type so variou were to be seen in the street
that no figur howev queer would have caus surpris but there wa

raskolnikov went out in complet confus thi confus becam more
and more intens as he went down the stair he even stop short two
or three time as though suddenli struck by some thought when he wa
in the street he cri out oh god how loathsom it all is and
can i can i possibl no it nonsens it rubbish he ad
resolut and how could such an atroci thing come into my head
what filthi thing my heart is capabl of ye filthi abov all
disgust loathsom loathsomeand for a whole month iv been
but no word no exclam could express hi agit the feel
of intens repuls which had begun to oppress and tortur hi heart
while he wa on hi wai to the old woman had by now reach such a
pitch and had taken such a definit form that he did not know what to
do with himself to escap from hi wretched he walk along the
pavement like a drunken man regardless of the passersbi and jostl
against them and onli came to hi sens when he wa in the next
street look round he notic that he wa stand close to a tavern
which wa enter by step lead from the pavement to the basement
at that instant two drunken men came out at the door and abus and
support on anoth thei mount the step without stop to
think raskolnikov went down the step at onc till that moment he had
never been into a tavern but now he felt giddi and wa torment by a
burn thirst he long for a drink of cold beer and attribut hi
sudden weak to the want of food he sat down at a sticki littl
tabl in a dark and dirti corner order some beer and eagerli drank
off the first glass at onc he felt easier and hi thought becam
clear
all that nonsens he said hopefulli and there is noth in it
all to worri about it simpli physic derang just a glass of
beer a piec of dry breadand in on moment the brain is stronger
the mind is clearer and the will is firm phew how utterli petti it all
is
but in spite of thi scorn reflect he wa by now look cheer
as though he were suddenli set free from a terribl burden and he gaze
round in a friendli wai at the peopl in the room but even at that
moment he had a dim forebod that thi happier frame of mind wa also
not normal
there were few peopl at the time in the tavern besid the two drunken
men he had met on the step a group consist of about five men and
a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time their departur
left the room quiet and rather empti the person still in the tavern
were a man who appear to be an artisan drunk but not extrem so
sit befor a pot of beer and hi companion a huge stout man with
a grei beard in a short fullskirt coat he wa veri drunk and had
drop asleep on the bench everi now and then he began as though in
hi sleep crack hi finger with hi arm wide apart and the upper
part of hi bodi bound about on the bench while he hum some
meaningless refrain try to recal some such line as these
hi wife a year he fondli love
hi wife aa year hefondli love
or suddenli wake up again
walk along the crowd row
he met the on he us to know
but no on share hi enjoy hi silent companion look with
posit hostil and mistrust at all these manifest there wa
anoth man in the room who look somewhat like a retir govern
clerk he wa sit apart now and then sip from hi pot and
look round at the compani he too appear to be in some agit
chapter ii
raskolnikov wa not us to crowd and as we said befor he avoid
societi of everi sort more especi of late but now all at onc he
felt a desir to be with other peopl someth new seem to be take
place within him and with it he felt a sort of thirst for compani he
wa so weari after a whole month of concentr wretched and gloomi
excit that he long to rest if onli for a moment in some other
world whatev it might be and in spite of the filthi of the
surround he wa glad now to stai in the tavern
the master of the establish wa in anoth room but he frequent
came down some step into the main room hi jaunti tar boot with
red turnov top come into view each time befor the rest of hi
person he wore a full coat and a horribl greasi black satin waistcoat
with no cravat and hi whole face seem smear with oil like an
iron lock at the counter stood a boi of about fourteen and there wa
anoth boi somewhat younger who hand whatev wa want on the
counter lai some slice cucumb some piec of dri black bread and
some fish chop up small all smell veri bad it wa insuffer
close and so heavi with the fume of spirit that five minut in such
an atmospher might well make a man drunk
there ar chanc meet with stranger that interest us from the
first moment befor a word is spoken such wa the impress made on
raskolnikov by the person sit a littl distanc from him who look
like a retir clerk the young man often recal thi impress
afterward and even ascrib it to presenti he look repeatedli
at the clerk partli no doubt becaus the latter wa stare
persist at him obvious anxiou to enter into convers at
the other person in the room includ the tavernkeep the clerk
look as though he were us to their compani and weari of it show
a shade of condescend contempt for them as person of station and
cultur inferior to hi own with whom it would be useless for him to
convers he wa a man over fifti bald and grizzl of medium height
and stoutli built hi face bloat from continu drink wa of
a yellow even greenish ting with swollen eyelid out of which keen
reddish ey gleam like littl chink but there wa someth veri
strang in him there wa a light in hi ey as though of intens
feelingperhap there were even thought and intellig but at the
same time there wa a gleam of someth like mad he wa wear an
old and hopelessli rag black dress coat with all it button miss
except on and that on he had button evid cling to thi
last trace of respect a crumpl shirt front cover with spot
and stain protrud from hi canva waistcoat like a clerk he wore
no beard nor moustach but had been so long unshaven that hi chin
look like a stiff greyish brush and there wa someth respect
and like an offici about hi manner too but he wa restless he
ruffl up hi hair and from time to time let hi head drop into hi
hand dejectedli rest hi rag elbow on the stain and sticki
tabl at last he look straight at raskolnikov and said loudli and
resolut

the first place would you have guess dear rodya that your sister
ha been live with me for the last six week and we shall not be
separ in the futur thank god her suffer ar over but i will
tell you everyth in order so that you mai know just how everyth
ha happen and all that we have hitherto conceal from you when you
wrote to me two month ago that you had heard that dounia had a great
deal to put up with in the svidrigalov hous when you wrote that
and ask me to tell you all about itwhat could i write in answer to
you if i had written the whole truth to you i dare sai you would have
thrown up everyth and have come to us even if you had to walk all
the wai for i know your charact and your feel and you would not
let your sister be insult i wa in despair myself but what could i
do and besid i did not know the whole truth myself then what
made it all so difficult wa that dounia receiv a hundr roubl
in advanc when she took the place as gover in their famili on
condit of part of her salari be deduct everi month and so it
wa imposs to throw up the situat without repai the debt
thi sum now i can explain it all to you my preciou rodya she took
chiefli in order to send you sixti roubl which you need so terribl
then and which you receiv from us last year we deceiv you then
write that thi monei came from dounia save but that wa not
so and now i tell you all about it becaus thank god thing have
suddenli chang for the better and that you mai know how dounia love
you and what a heart she ha at first inde mr svidrigalov treat
her veri rude and us to make disrespect and jeer remark at
tabl but i dont want to go into all those pain detail so as
not to worri you for noth when it is now all over in short in spite
of the kind and gener behaviour of marfa petrovna mr svidrigalov
wife and all the rest of the household dounia had a veri hard time
especi when mr svidrigalov relaps into hi old regiment
habit wa under the influenc of bacchu and how do you think it
wa all explain later on would you believ that the crazi fellow had
conceiv a passion for dounia from the begin but had conceal
it under a show of rude and contempt possibl he wa asham and
horrifi himself at hi own flighti hope consid hi year and
hi be the father of a famili and that made him angri with dounia
and possibl too he hope by hi rude and sneer behaviour to hide
the truth from other but at last he lost all control and had the face
to make dounia an open and shame propos promis her all sort of
induc and offer besid to throw up everyth and take her
to anoth estat of hi or even abroad you can imagin all she went
through to leav her situat at onc wa imposs not onli on
account of the monei debt but also to spare the feel of marfa
petrovna whose suspicion would have been arous and then dounia
would have been the caus of a ruptur in the famili and it would
have meant a terribl scandal for dounia too that would have been
inevit there were variou other reason ow to which dounia could
not hope to escap from that aw hous for anoth six week you know
dounia of cours you know how clever she is and what a strong will she
ha dounia can endur a great deal and even in the most difficult case
she ha the fortitud to maintain her firm she did not even write
to me about everyth for fear of upset me although we were
constantli in commun it all end veri unexpectedli marfa
petrovna accident overheard her husband implor dounia in the
garden and put quit a wrong interpret on the posit threw
the blame upon her believ her to be the caus of it all an aw
scene took place between them on the spot in the garden marfa petrovna
went so far as to strike dounia refus to hear anyth and wa
shout at her for a whole hour and then gave order that dounia should
be pack off at onc to me in a plain peasant cart into which thei
flung all her thing her linen and her cloth all pellmel without
fold it up and pack it and a heavi shower of rain came on too
and dounia insult and put to shame had to drive with a peasant in an
open cart all the seventeen verst into town onli think now what answer
could i have sent to the letter i receiv from you two month ago and
what could i have written i wa in despair i dare not write to
you the truth becaus you would have been veri unhappi mortifi
and indign and yet what could you do you could onli perhap ruin
yourself and besid dounia would not allow it and fill up my letter
with trifl when my heart wa so full of sorrow i could not for a
whole month the town wa full of gossip about thi scandal and it came
to such a pass that dounia and i dare not even go to church on account
of the contemptu look whisper and even remark made aloud about
us all our acquaint avoid us nobodi even bow to us in the
street and i learnt that some shopmen and clerk were intend to
insult us in a shame wai smear the gate of our hous with pitch
so that the landlord began to tell us we must leav all thi wa set
go by marfa petrovna who manag to slander dounia and throw dirt at
her in everi famili she know everyon in the neighbourhood and that
month she wa continu come into the town and as she is
rather talk and fond of gossip about her famili affair and
particularli of complain to all and each of her husbandwhich is not
at all rightso in a short time she had spread her stori not onli in
the town but over the whole surround district it made me ill but
dounia bore it better than i did and if onli you could have seen how
she endur it all and tri to comfort me and cheer me up she is
an angel but by god merci our suffer were cut short mr
svidrigalov return to hi sens and repent and probabl
feel sorri for dounia he laid befor marfa petrovna a complet and
unmistak proof of dounia innoc in the form of a letter dounia
had been forc to write and give to him befor marfa petrovna
came upon them in the garden thi letter which remain in mr
svidrigalov hand after her departur she had written to refus
person explan and secret interview for which he wa entreat
her in that letter she reproach him with great heat and indign
for the base of hi behaviour in regard to marfa petrovna remind
him that he wa the father and head of a famili and tell him how
infam it wa of him to torment and make unhappi a defenceless girl
unhappi enough alreadi inde dear rodya the letter wa so nobli and
touchingli written that i sob when i read it and to thi dai i cannot
read it without tear moreov the evid of the servant too
clear dounia reput thei had seen and known a great deal more
than mr svidrigalov had himself supposeda inde is alwai the case
with servant marfa petrovna wa complet taken aback and again
crush as she said herself to us but she wa complet convinc of
dounia innoc the veri next dai be sundai she went straight
to the cathedr knelt down and prai with tear to our ladi to give
her strength to bear thi new trial and to do her duti then she
came straight from the cathedr to us told us the whole stori wept
bitterli and fulli penit she embrac dounia and besought her to
forgiv her the same morn without ani delai she went round to all
the hous in the town and everywher shed tear she assert in
the most flatter term dounia innoc and the nobil of
her feel and her behavior what wa more she show and read to
everyon the letter in dounia own handwrit to mr svidrigalov and
even allow them to take copi of itwhich i must sai i think wa
superflu in thi wai she wa busi for sever dai in drive about
the whole town becaus some peopl had taken offenc through preced
have been given to other and therefor thei had to take turn so
that in everi hous she wa expect befor she arriv and everyon
knew that on such and such a dai marfa petrovna would be read the
letter in such and such a place and peopl assembl for everi read
of it even mani who had heard it sever time alreadi both in their
own hous and in other peopl in my opinion a great deal a veri
great deal of all thi wa unnecessari but that marfa petrovna
charact anywai she succeed in complet reestablish dounia
reput and the whole ignomini of thi affair rest as an indel
disgrac upon her husband as the onli person to blame so that i realli
began to feel sorri for him it wa realli treat the crazi fellow too
harshli dounia wa at onc ask to give lesson in sever famili
but she refus all of a sudden everyon began to treat her with mark
respect and all thi did much to bring about the event by which on mai
sai our whole fortun ar now transform you must know dear rodya
that dounia ha a suitor and that she ha alreadi consent to marri
him i hasten to tell you all about the matter and though it ha been
arrang without ask your consent i think you will not be aggriev
with me or with your sister on that account for you will see that we
could not wait and put off our decis till we heard from you and you
could not have judg all the fact without be on the spot thi
wa how it happen he is alreadi of the rank of a counsellor pyotr
petrovitch luzhin and is distantli relat to marfa petrovna who
ha been veri activ in bring the match about it began with hi
express through her hi desir to make our acquaint he wa
properli receiv drank coffe with us and the veri next dai he sent
us a letter in which he veri courteous made an offer and beg for a
speedi and decid answer he is a veri busi man and is in a great hurri
to get to petersburg so that everi moment is preciou to him at first
of cours we were greatli surpris as it had all happen so quickli
and unexpectedli we thought and talk it over the whole dai he is a
welltodo man to be depend upon he ha two post in the govern
and ha alreadi made hi fortun it is true that he is fortyf year
old but he is of a fairli prepossess appear and might still be
thought attract by women and he is altogeth a veri respect and
present man onli he seem a littl moros and somewhat conceit
but possibl that mai onli be the impress he make at first sight
and bewar dear rodya when he come to petersburg as he shortli will
do bewar of judg him too hastili and sever as your wai is if
there is anyth you do not like in him at first sight i give you thi
warn although i feel sure that he will make a favour impress
upon you moreov in order to understand ani man on must be
deliber and care to avoid form prejudic and mistaken idea
which ar veri difficult to correct and get over afterward and pyotr
petrovitch judg by mani indic is a thoroughli estim man
at hi first visit inde he told us that he wa a practic man but
still he share as he express it mani of the convict of our
most rise gener and he is an oppon of all prejudic he
said a good deal more for he seem a littl conceit and like to be
listen to but thi is scarc a vice i of cours understood veri
littl of it but dounia explain to me that though he is not a man
of great educ he is clever and seem to be goodnatur you know
your sister charact rodya she is a resolut sensibl patient and
gener girl but she ha a passion heart as i know veri well
of cours there is no great love either on hi side or on her but
dounia is a clever girl and ha the heart of an angel and will make
it her duti to make her husband happi who on hi side will make her
happi hi care of that we have no good reason to doubt though it
must be admit the matter ha been arrang in great hast besid he
is a man of great prudenc and he will see to be sure of himself that
hi own happi will be the more secur the happier dounia is with
him and as for some defect of charact for some habit and even
certain differ of opinionwhich inde ar inevit even in
the happiest marriagesdounia ha said that as regard all that she
reli on herself that there is noth to be uneasi about and
that she is readi to put up with a great deal if onli their futur
relationship can be an honour and straightforward on he struck me
for instanc at first as rather abrupt but that mai well come
from hi be an outspoken man and that is no doubt how it is for
instanc at hi second visit after he had receiv dounia consent
in the cours of convers he declar that befor make
dounia acquaint he had made up hi mind to marri a girl of
good reput without dowri and abov all on who had experienc
poverti becaus as he explain a man ought not to be indebt to hi
wife but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her
benefactor i must add that he express it more nice and polit
than i have done for i have forgotten hi actual phrase and onli
rememb the mean and besid it wa obvious not said of design
but slip out in the heat of convers so that he tri afterward
to correct himself and smooth it over but all the same it did strike
me as somewhat rude and i said so afterward to dounia but dounia wa
vex and answer that word ar not deed and that of cours is
perfectli true dounia did not sleep all night befor she made up
her mind and think that i wa asleep she got out of bed and wa
walk up and down the room all night at last she knelt down befor
the ikon and prai long and fervent and in the morn she told me
that she had decid
i have mention alreadi that pyotr petrovitch is just set off for
petersburg where he ha a great deal of busi and he want to open
a legal bureau he ha been occupi for mani year in conduct civil
and commerci litig and onli the other dai he won an import
case he ha to be in petersburg becaus he ha an import case befor
the senat so rodya dear he mai be of the greatest us to you in
everi wai inde and dounia and i have agre that from thi veri dai
you could definit enter upon your career and might consid that
your futur is mark out and assur for you oh if onli thi come to
pass thi would be such a benefit that we could onli look upon it as a
providenti bless dounia is dream of noth els we have even
ventur alreadi to drop a few word on the subject to pyotr petrovitch
he wa cautiou in hi answer and said that of cours as he could not
get on without a secretari it would be better to be pai a salari to
a relat than to a stranger if onli the former were fit for the
duti as though there could be doubt of your be fit but then
he express doubt whether your studi at the univers would leav
you time for work at hi offic the matter drop for the time but
dounia is think of noth els now she ha been in a sort of fever
for the last few dai and ha alreadi made a regular plan for
your becom in the end an associ and even a partner in pyotr
petrovitch busi which might well be see that you ar a
student of law i am in complet agreement with her rodya and share

natur at present sinc he doe not know you dounia is firmli
persuad that she will gain everyth by her good influenc over her
futur husband thi she is reckon upon of cours we ar care
not to talk of ani of these more remot plan to pyotr petrovitch

take thi veri coldli it might all seem to him simpli a daydream nor
ha either dounia or i breath a word to him of the great hope we have
of hi help us to pai for your univers studi we have not spoken
of it in the first place becaus it will come to pass of itself
later on and he will no doubt without wast word offer to do it of
himself as though he could refus dounia that the more readili sinc
you mai by your own effort becom hi right hand in the offic and
receiv thi assist not as a chariti but as a salari earn by your
own work dounia want to arrang it all like thi and i quit agre
with her and we have not spoken of our plan for anoth reason that
is becaus i particularli want you to feel on an equal foot when

him close for oneself and that he look forward to form hi own
opinion when he make your acquaint do you know my preciou

fanci i should do better to go on live by myself apart than with

delic enough to invit me and to urg me to remain with my daughter

simpli becaus it ha been taken for grant but i shall refus i have
notic more than onc in my life that husband dont quit get on with
their mothersinlaw and i dont want to be the least bit in anyon

pulcheria raskolnikov
almost from the first while he read the letter raskolnikov face wa
wet with tear but when he finish it hi face wa pale and distort
and a bitter wrath and malign smile wa on hi lip he laid hi
head down on hi threadbar dirti pillow and ponder ponder a long
time hi heart wa beat violent and hi brain wa in a turmoil
at last he felt cramp and stifl in the littl yellow room that wa
like a cupboard or a box hi ey and hi mind crave for space he
took up hi hat and went out thi time without dread of meet
anyon he had forgotten hi dread he turn in the direct of the
vassilyevski ostrov walk along vassilyevski prospect as though
hasten on some busi but he walk as hi habit wa without
notic hi wai mutter and even speak aloud to himself to the
astonish of the passersbi mani of them took him to be drunk
chapter iv
hi mother letter had been a tortur to him but as regard the chief
fact in it he had felt not on moment hesit even whilst he wa
read the letter the essenti question wa settl and irrevoc
settl in hi mind never such a marriag while i am aliv and
mr luzhin be damn the thing is perfectli clear he mutter
to himself with a malign smile anticip the triumph of hi
decis no mother no dounia you wont deceiv me and then thei
apologis for not ask my advic and for take the decis without
me i dare sai thei imagin it is arrang now and cant be broken
off but we will see whether it can or not a magnific excus
pyotr petrovitch is such a busi man that even hi wed ha to be in
posthast almost by express no dounia i see it all and i know what
you want to sai to me and i know too what you were think about when
you walk up and down all night and what your prayer were like befor
the holi mother of kazan who stand in mother bedroom bitter is
the ascent to golgotha hm so it is final settl you have
determin to marri a sensibl busi man avdotya romanovna on
who ha a fortun ha alreadi made hi fortun that is so much
more solid and impress a man who hold two govern post and who
share the idea of our most rise gener as mother write and
who seem to be kind as dounia herself observ that seem beat
everyth and that veri dounia for that veri seem is marri
him splendid splendid
but i should like to know why mother ha written to me about our
most rise gener simpli as a descript touch or with the idea
of prepossess me in favour of mr luzhin oh the cun of them
i should like to know on thing more how far thei were open with on
anoth that dai and night and all thi time sinc wa it all put into
word or did both understand that thei had the same thing at heart
and in their mind so that there wa no need to speak of it aloud and
better not to speak of it most like it wa partli like that from
mother letter it evid he struck her as rude a littl and
mother in her simplic took her observ to dounia and she wa
sure to be vex and answer her angrili i should think so who
would not be anger when it wa quit clear without ani nave question
and when it wa understood that it wa useless to discuss it and why
doe she write to me love dounia rodya and she love you more than
herself ha she a secret conscienceprick at sacrif her daughter
to her son you ar our on comfort you ar everyth to us oh
mother
hi bitter grew more and more intens and if he had happen to
meet mr luzhin at the moment he might have murder him
hm ye that true he continu pursu the whirl idea that
chase each other in hi brain it is true that it need time and care
to get to know a man but there is no mistak about mr luzhin the
chief thing is he is a man of busi and seem kind that wa
someth wasnt it to send the bag and big box for them a kind man
no doubt after that but hi bride and her mother ar to drive in a
peasant cart cover with sack i know i have been driven in
it no matter it is onli nineti verst and then thei can travel veri
comfort third class for a thousand verst quit right too on
must cut on coat accord to on cloth but what about you mr
luzhin she is your bride and you must be awar that her mother ha
to rais monei on her pension for the journei to be sure it a matter
of busi a partnership for mutual benefit with equal share and
expensesfood and drink provid but pai for your tobacco the
busi man ha got the better of them too the luggag will cost less
than their fare and veri like go for noth how is it that thei
dont both see all that or is it that thei dont want to see and
thei ar pleas pleas and to think that thi is onli the first
blossom and that the real fruit ar to come but what realli
matter is not the stingi is not the mean but the tone
of the whole thing for that will be the tone after marriag it a
foretast of it and mother too why should she be so lavish what will
she have by the time she get to petersburg three silver roubl or
two paper on as she sai that old woman hm what doe
she expect to live upon in petersburg afterward she ha her reason
alreadi for guess that she could not live with dounia after the
marriag even for the first few month the good man ha no doubt let
slip someth on that subject also though mother would deni it i
shall refus sai she on whom is she reckon then is she count
on what is left of her hundr and twenti roubl of pension when
afanasi ivanovitch debt is paid she knit woollen shawl and
embroid cuff ruin her old ey and all her shawl dont add
more than twenti roubl a year to her hundr and twenti i know
that so she is build all her hope all the time on mr luzhin
generos he will offer it of himself he will press it on me
you mai wait a long time for that that how it alwai is with these
schilleresqu nobl heart till the last moment everi goos is a swan
with them till the last moment thei hope for the best and will see
noth wrong and although thei have an inkl of the other side of
the pictur yet thei wont face the truth till thei ar forc to the
veri thought of it make them shiver thei thrust the truth awai with
both hand until the man thei deck out in fals colour put a fool
cap on them with hi own hand i should like to know whether mr luzhin
ha ani order of merit i bet he ha the anna in hi buttonhol and
that he put it on when he goe to dine with contractor or merchant
he will be sure to have it for hi wed too enough of him confound
him
well mother i dont wonder at it like her god bless her but
how could dounia dounia darl as though i did not know you you were
nearli twenti when i saw you last i understood you then mother write
that dounia can put up with a great deal i know that veri well i
knew that two year and a half ago and for the last two and a half
year i have been think about it think of just that that dounia
can put up with a great deal if she could put up with mr svidrigalov
and all the rest of it she certainli can put up with a great deal and
now mother and she have taken it into their head that she can put up
with mr luzhin who propound the theori of the superior of
wive rais from destitut and ow everyth to their husband
bountywho propound it too almost at the first interview grant
that he let it slip though he is a sensibl man yet mayb it
wa not a slip at all but he meant to make himself clear as soon as
possibl but dounia dounia she understand the man of cours but
she will have to live with the man why shed live on black bread
and water she would not sell her soul she would not barter her moral
freedom for comfort she would not barter it for all schleswigholstein
much less mr luzhin monei no dounia wa not that sort when i knew
her and she is still the same of cours ye there no deni
the svidrigalov ar a bitter pill it a bitter thing to spend on
life a gover in the provinc for two hundr roubl but i know
she would rather be a nigger on a plantat or a lett with a german
master than degrad her soul and her moral digniti by bind herself
for ever to a man whom she doe not respect and with whom she ha
noth in commonfor her own advantag and if mr luzhin had been of
unalloi gold or on huge diamond she would never have consent to
becom hi legal concubin why is she consent then what the
point of it what the answer it clear enough for herself for her
comfort to save her life she would not sell herself but for someon
els she is do it for on she love for on she ador she will
sell herself that what it all amount to for her brother for her
mother she will sell herself she will sell everyth in such case
we overcom our moral feel if necessari freedom peac conscienc
even all all ar brought into the market let my life go if onli my
dear on mai be happi more than that we becom casuist we learn
to be jesuit and for a time mayb we can sooth ourselv we can
persuad ourselv that it is on duti for a good object that just
like us it as clear as daylight it clear that rodion romanovitch
raskolnikov is the central figur in the busi and no on els oh
ye she can ensur hi happi keep him in the univers make him
a partner in the offic make hi whole futur secur perhap he mai
even be a rich man later on prosper respect and mai even end hi
life a famou man but my mother it all rodya preciou rodya her
first born for such a son who would not sacrific such a daughter oh
love overparti heart why for hi sake we would not shrink even
from sonia fate sonia sonia marmeladov the etern victim so long
as the world last have you taken the measur of your sacrific both
of you is it right can you bear it is it ani us is there sens in
it and let me tell you dounia sonia life is no wors than life with
mr luzhin there can be no question of love mother write and what
if there can be no respect either if on the contrari there is avers
contempt repuls what then so you will have to keep up your
appear too is not that so do you understand what that smart
mean do you understand that the luzhin smart is just the same
thing as sonia and mai be wors viler baser becaus in your case
dounia it a bargain for luxuri after all but with sonia it
simpli a question of starvat it ha to be paid for it ha to be

go that wai to the devil i suppos so that the rest mai remain
chast and not be interf with a percentag what splendid word
thei have thei ar so scientif so consolatori onc youv said
percentag there noth more to worri about if we had ani other
word mayb we might feel more uneasi but what if dounia were on
of the percentag of anoth on if not that on
but where am i go he thought suddenli strang i came out for
someth as soon as i had read the letter i came out i wa go
to vassilyevski ostrov to razumihin that what it wa now i
rememb what for though and what put the idea of go to razumihin
into my head just now that curiou
he wonder at himself razumihin wa on of hi old comrad at the
univers it wa remark that raskolnikov had hardli ani friend at
the univers he kept aloof from everyon went to see no on and did
not welcom anyon who came to see him and inde everyon soon gave
him up he took no part in the student gather amus or
convers he work with great intens without spare himself
and he wa respect for thi but no on like him he wa veri poor
and there wa a sort of haughti pride and reserv about him as though
he were keep someth to himself he seem to some of hi comrad
to look down upon them all as children as though he were superior in
develop knowledg and convict as though their belief and
interest were beneath him
with razumihin he had got on or at least he wa more unreserv and
commun with him inde it wa imposs to be on ani other
term with razumihin he wa an exception goodhumour and candid
youth goodnatur to the point of simplic though both depth and
digniti lai conceal under that simplic the better of hi comrad
understood thi and all were fond of him he wa extrem intellig
though he wa certainli rather a simpleton at time he wa of strike
appearancetal thin blackhair and alwai badli shave he wa
sometim uproari and wa reput to be of great physic strength
on night when out in a festiv compani he had with on blow laid
a gigant policeman on hi back there wa no limit to hi drink
power but he could abstain from drink altogeth he sometim went
too far in hi prank but he could do without prank altogeth
anoth thing strike about razumihin no failur distress him and
it seem as though no unfavour circumst could crush him he
could lodg anywher and bear the extrem of cold and hunger he wa
veri poor and kept himself entir on what he could earn by work of
on sort or anoth he knew of no end of resourc by which to earn
monei he spent on whole winter without light hi stove and us to
declar that he like it better becaus on slept more soundli in
the cold for the present he too had been oblig to give up the
univers but it wa onli for a time and he wa work with all hi
might to save enough to return to hi studi again raskolnikov had
not been to see him for the last four month and razumihin did not even
know hi address about two month befor thei had met in the street
but raskolnikov had turn awai and even cross to the other side that
he might not be observ and though razumihin notic him he pass
him by as he did not want to annoi him
chapter v
of cours iv been mean late to go to razumihin to ask for
work to ask him to get me lesson or someth raskolnikov thought
but what help can he be to me now suppos he get me lesson suppos
he share hi last farth with me if he ha ani farth so that
i could get some boot and make myself tidi enough to give lesson
hm well and what then what shall i do with the few copper i
earn that not what i want now it realli absurd for me to go to
razumihin
the question why he wa now go to razumihin agit him even more
than he wa himself awar he kept uneasili seek for some sinist
signific in thi appar ordinari action
could i have expect to set it all straight and to find a wai out by
mean of razumihin alon he ask himself in perplex
he ponder and rub hi forehead and strang to sai after long
muse suddenli as if it were spontan and by chanc a fantast
thought came into hi head
hm to razumihin he said all at onc calmli as though he had
reach a final determin i shall go to razumihin of cours
but not now i shall go to him on the next dai after it when it
will be over and everyth will begin afresh
and suddenli he realis what he wa think
after it he shout jump up from the seat but is it realli
go to happen is it possibl it realli will happen he left the
seat and went off almost at a run he meant to turn back homeward
but the thought of go home suddenli fill him with intens loath
in that hole in that aw littl cupboard of hi all thi had for a
month past been grow up in him and he walk on at random
hi nervou shudder had pass into a fever that made him feel
shiver in spite of the heat he felt cold with a kind of effort he
began almost unconsci from some inner crave to stare at all
the object befor him as though look for someth to distract hi
attent but he did not succe and kept drop everi moment into
brood when with a start he lift hi head again and look round
he forgot at onc what he had just been think about and even where he
wa go in thi wai he walk right across vassilyevski ostrov came
out on to the lesser neva cross the bridg and turn toward the
island the green and fresh were at first rest to hi weari
ey after the dust of the town and the huge hous that hem him in
and weigh upon him here there were no tavern no stifl close
no stench but soon these new pleasant sensat pass into morbid
irrit sometim he stood still befor a brightli paint summer
villa stand among green foliag he gaze through the fenc he saw
in the distanc smartli dress women on the verandah and balconi
and children run in the garden the flower especi caught hi
attent he gaze at them longer than at anyth he wa met too by
luxuri carriag and by men and women on horseback he watch them
with curiou ey and forgot about them befor thei had vanish from
hi sight onc he stood still and count hi monei he found he had
thirti copeck twenti to the policeman three to nastasya for the
letter so i must have given fortyseven or fifti to the marmeladov
yesterdai he thought reckon it up for some unknown reason but he
soon forgot with what object he had taken the monei out of hi pocket
he recal it on pass an eatinghous or tavern and felt that he
wa hungri go into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and at a
pie of some sort he finish eat it as he walk awai it wa a long
while sinc he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at onc
though he onli drank a wineglass hi leg felt suddenli heavi and
a great drowsi came upon him he turn homeward but reach

wa not consciou of fatigu it wa as though an abscess that had been
form for a month past in hi heart had suddenli broken freedom
freedom he wa free from that spell that sorceri that obsess
later on when he recal that time and all that happen to him dure
those dai minut by minut point by point he wa superstiti
impress by on circumst which though in itself not veri
except alwai seem to him afterward the predestin
turningpoint of hi fate he could never understand and explain to
himself why when he wa tire and worn out when it would have been
more conveni for him to go home by the shortest and most direct wai
he had return by the hai market where he had no need to go it wa
obvious and quit unnecessarili out of hi wai though not much so it
is true that it happen to him dozen of time to return home without
notic what street he pass through but why he wa alwai ask
himself why had such an import such a decis and at the same time
such an absolut chanc meet happen in the hai market where he
had moreov no reason to go at the veri hour the veri minut of hi
life when he wa just in the veri mood and in the veri circumst
in which that meet wa abl to exert the gravest and most decis
influenc on hi whole destini as though it had been ly in wait for

been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainti with
greater exact and less risk and without danger inquiri and
investig that next dai at a certain time an old woman on whose

chapter vi
later on raskolnikov happen to find out why the huckster and hi
wife had invit lizaveta it wa a veri ordinari matter and there wa
noth except about it a famili who had come to the town and been
reduc to poverti were sell their household good and cloth all

undertook such job and wa frequent emploi as she wa veri honest
and alwai fix a fair price and stuck to it she spoke as a rule
littl and as we have said alreadi she wa veri submiss and timid
but raskolnikov had becom superstiti of late the trace of
superstit remain in him long after and were almost ineradic
and in all thi he wa alwai afterward dispos to see someth
strang and mysteri as it were the presenc of some peculiar
influenc and coincid in the previou winter a student he knew
call pokorev who had left for harkov had chanc in convers to
give him the address of alyona ivanovna the old pawnbrok in case he
might want to pawn anyth for a long while he did not go to her for

he found the old woman he had felt an insurmount repuls for her
at the first glanc though he knew noth special about her he got
two roubl from her and went into a miser littl tavern on hi wai
home he ask for tea sat down and sank into deep thought a strang
idea wa peck at hi brain like a chicken in the egg and veri veri
much absorb him
almost besid him at the next tabl there wa sit a student whom he
did not know and had never seen and with him a young offic thei had
plai a game of billiard and began drink tea all at onc he heard
the student mention to the offic the pawnbrok alyona ivanovna and
give him her address thi of itself seem strang to raskolnikov he
had just come from her and here at onc he heard her name of cours

impress and here someon seem to be speak expressli for him
the student began tell hi friend variou detail about alyona

as rich as a jew she can give you five thousand roubl at a time and
she is not abov take a pledg for a roubl lot of our fellow have

were onli a dai late with your interest the pledg wa lost how she
gave a quarter of the valu of an articl and took five and even seven
percent a month on it and so on the student chatter on sai
that she had a sister lizaveta whom the wretch littl creatur wa

thei began talk about lizaveta the student spoke about her with a
peculiar relish and wa continu laugh and the offic listen

wash she did sew and work as a charwoman and gave her sister
all she earn she did not dare to accept an order or job of ani kind
without her sister permiss the old woman had alreadi made her
will and lizaveta knew of it and by thi will she would not get a
farth noth but the movabl chair and so on all the monei wa
left to a monasteri in the provinc of n that prayer might be
said for her in perpetu lizaveta wa of lower rank than her sister
unmarri and awfulli uncouth in appear remark tall with long
feet that look as if thei were bent outward she alwai wore batter
goatskin shoe and wa clean in her person what the student express
most surpris and amus about wa the fact that lizaveta wa

there it is it natur
oh well brother but we have to correct and direct natur and but
for that we should drown in an ocean of prejudic but for that
there would never have been a singl great man thei talk of

consciencebut the point is what do we mean by them stai i have
anoth question to ask you listen
no you stai ill ask you a question listen
well
you ar talk and speechifi awai but tell me would you kill the
old woman yourself
of cours not i wa onli argu the justic of it it noth to
do with me
but i think if you would not do it yourself there no justic about
it let us have anoth game
raskolnikov wa violent agit of cours it wa all ordinari
youth talk and thought such as he had often heard befor in
differ form and on differ theme but why had he happen to hear
such a discuss and such idea at the veri moment when hi own brain
wa just conceiv the veri same idea and why just at the
moment when he had brought awai the embryo of hi idea from the old
woman had he drop at onc upon a convers about her thi
coincid alwai seem strang to him thi trivial talk in a tavern
had an immens influenc on him in hi later action as though there had
realli been in it someth preordain some guid hint
on return from the hai market he flung himself on the sofa and sat
for a whole hour without stir meanwhil it got dark he had no
candl and inde it did not occur to him to light up he could never
recollect whether he had been think about anyth at that time at
last he wa consciou of hi former fever and shiver and he realis
with relief that he could lie down on the sofa soon heavi leaden sleep
came over him as it were crush him
he slept an extraordinarili long time and without dream nastasya
come into hi room at ten oclock the next morn had difficulti
in rous him she brought him in tea and bread the tea wa again the
second brew and again in her own teapot
my good how he sleep she cri indignantli and he is alwai
asleep
he got up with an effort hi head ach he stood up took a turn in
hi garret and sank back on the sofa again
go to sleep again cri nastasya ar you ill eh
he made no repli
do you want some tea
afterward he said with an effort close hi ey again and turn
to the wall
nastasya stood over him
perhap he realli is ill she said turn and went out she came in
again at two oclock with soup he wa ly as befor the tea stood
untouch nastasya felt posit offend and began wrathfulli
rous him
why ar you ly like a log she shout look at him with
repuls
he got up and sat down again but said noth and stare at the floor
ar you ill or not ask nastasya and again receiv no answer
youd better go out and get a breath of air she said after a paus
will you eat it or not
afterward he said weakli you can go
and he motion her out
she remain a littl longer look at him with compass and went
out
a few minut afterward he rais hi ey and look for a long while
at the tea and the soup then he took the bread took up a spoon and
began to eat
he at a littl three or four spoon without appetit as it were
mechan hi head ach less after hi meal he stretch himself
on the sofa again but now he could not sleep he lai without stir
with hi face in the pillow he wa haunt by daydream and such
strang daydream in on that kept recur he fanci that he wa
in africa in egypt in some sort of oasi the caravan wa rest
the camel were peacefulli ly down the palm stood all around in a
complet circl all the parti were at dinner but he wa drink water
from a spring which flow gurgl close by and it wa so cool it wa
wonder wonder blue cold water run among the particolour
stone and over the clean sand which glisten here and there like
gold suddenli he heard a clock strike he start rous himself
rais hi head look out of the window and see how late it wa
suddenli jump up wide awak as though someon had pull him off the
sofa he crept on tipto to the door stealthili open it and began
listen on the staircas hi heart beat terribl but all wa quiet
on the stair as if everyon wa asleep it seem to him strang and
monstrou that he could have slept in such forget from the
previou dai and had done noth had prepar noth yet and
meanwhil perhap it had struck six and hi drowsi and stupefact
were follow by an extraordinari feverish as it were distract
hast but the prepar to be made were few he concentr all hi
energi on think of everyth and forget noth and hi heart
kept beat and thump so that he could hardli breath first he had
to make a noos and sew it into hi overcoata work of a moment he
rummag under hi pillow and pick out amongst the linen stuf awai
under it a worn out old unwash shirt from it rag he tore a long
strip a coupl of inch wide and about sixteen inch long he fold
thi strip in two took off hi wide strong summer overcoat of some
stout cotton materi hi onli outer garment and began sew the two
end of the rag on the insid under the left armhol hi hand shook
as he sew but he did it successfulli so that noth show outsid
when he put the coat on again the needl and thread he had got readi
long befor and thei lai on hi tabl in a piec of paper as for the
noos it wa a veri ingeni devic of hi own the noos wa intend
for the ax it wa imposs for him to carri the ax through the
street in hi hand and if hidden under hi coat he would still have
had to support it with hi hand which would have been notic now
he had onli to put the head of the ax in the noos and it would hang
quietli under hi arm on the insid put hi hand in hi coat
pocket he could hold the end of the handl all the wai so that it did
not swing and as the coat wa veri full a regular sack in fact it
could not be seen from outsid that he wa hold someth with the
hand that wa in the pocket thi noos too he had design a
fortnight befor
when he had finish with thi he thrust hi hand into a littl open
between hi sofa and the floor fumbl in the left corner and drew out
the pledg which he had got readi long befor and hidden there thi
pledg wa howev onli a smoothli plane piec of wood the size and
thick of a silver cigarett case he pick up thi piec of wood
in on of hi wander in a courtyard where there wa some sort of
a workshop afterward he had ad to the wood a thin smooth piec
of iron which he had also pick up at the same time in the street
put the iron which wa a littl the smaller on the piec of wood
he fasten them veri firmli cross and recross the thread round
them then wrap them carefulli and daintili in clean white paper and
ti up the parcel so that it would be veri difficult to unti it thi
wa in order to divert the attent of the old woman for a time while
she wa try to undo the knot and so to gain a moment the iron strip
wa ad to give weight so that the woman might not guess the first
minut that the thing wa made of wood all thi had been store by
him beforehand under the sofa he had onli just got the pledg out when
he heard someon suddenli about in the yard
it struck six long ago
long ago my god
he rush to the door listen caught up hi hat and began to descend
hi thirteen step cautious noiselessli like a cat he had still the
most import thing to doto steal the ax from the kitchen that the
deed must be done with an ax he had decid long ago he had also a
pocket pruningknif but he could not reli on the knife and still less
on hi own strength and so resolv final on the ax we mai note in
pass on peculiar in regard to all the final resolut taken by
him in the matter thei had on strang characterist the more final
thei were the more hideou and the more absurd thei at onc becam in
hi ey in spite of all hi agonis inward struggl he never for
a singl instant all that time could believ in the carri out of hi
plan
and inde if it had ever happen that everyth to the least point
could have been consid and final settl and no uncertainti of
ani kind had remain he would it seem have renounc it all
as someth absurd monstrou and imposs but a whole mass of
unsettl point and uncertainti remain as for get the ax
that trifl busi cost him no anxieti for noth could be easier
nastasya wa continu out of the hous especi in the even
she would run in to the neighbour or to a shop and alwai left the
door ajar it wa the on thing the landladi wa alwai scold her
about and so when the time came he would onli have to go quietli into
the kitchen and to take the ax and an hour later when everyth
wa over go in and put it back again but these were doubt point
suppos he return an hour later to put it back and nastasya had
come back and wa on the spot he would of cours have to go by and wait
till she went out again but suppos she were in the meantim to miss
the ax look for it make an outcrythat would mean suspicion or at
least ground for suspicion
but those were all trifl which he had not even begun to consid and
inde he had no time he wa think of the chief point and put off
trifl detail until he could believ in it all but that seem
utterli unattain so it seem to himself at least he could not
imagin for instanc that he would sometim leav off think get
up and simpli go there even hi late experi ie hi visit with
the object of a final survei of the place wa simpli an attempt at
an experi far from be the real thing as though on should sai
come let us go and try itwhi dream about itand at onc he
had broken down and had run awai curs in a frenzi with himself
meanwhil it would seem as regard the moral question that hi
analysi wa complet hi casuistri had becom keen as a razor and he
could not find ration object in himself but in the last resort
he simpli ceas to believ in himself and doggedli slavishli sought
argument in all direct fumbl for them as though someon were
forc and draw him to it
at firstlong befor indeedh had been much occupi with on
question why almost all crime ar so badli conceal and so easili
detect and why almost all crimin leav such obviou trace he
had come gradual to mani differ and curiou conclus and in hi
opinion the chief reason lai not so much in the materi imposs
of conceal the crime as in the crimin himself almost everi
crimin is subject to a failur of will and reason power by a
childish and phenomen heedless at the veri instant when prudenc
and caution ar most essenti it wa hi convict that thi eclips
of reason and failur of will power attack a man like a diseas
develop gradual and reach it highest point just befor the
perpetr of the crime continu with equal violenc at the moment
of the crime and for longer or shorter time after accord to the
individu case and then pass off like ani other diseas the
question whether the diseas give rise to the crime or whether the
crime from it own peculiar natur is alwai accompani by someth of
the natur of diseas he did not yet feel abl to decid
when he reach these conclus he decid that in hi own case there
could not be such a morbid reaction that hi reason and will would
remain unimpair at the time of carri out hi design for the
simpl reason that hi design wa not a crime we will omit all the
process by mean of which he arriv at thi last conclus we have
run too far ahead alreadi we mai add onli that the practic pure
materi difficulti of the affair occupi a secondari posit in hi
mind on ha but to keep all on willpow and reason to deal
with them and thei will all be overcom at the time when onc on ha
familiaris oneself with the minutest detail of the busi but
thi prepar had never been begun hi final decis were what he
came to trust least and when the hour struck it all came to pass quit
differ as it were accident and unexpectedli
on trifl circumst upset hi calcul befor he had even
left the staircas when he reach the landladi kitchen the door
of which wa open as usual he glanc cautious in to see whether in
nastasya absenc the landladi herself wa there or if not whether
the door to her own room wa close so that she might not peep out when
he went in for the ax but what wa hi amaz when he suddenli
saw that nastasya wa not onli at home in the kitchen but wa occupi
there take linen out of a basket and hang it on a line see
him she left off hang the cloth turn to him and stare at him
all the time he wa pass he turn awai hi ey and walk past as
though he notic noth but it wa the end of everyth he had not
the ax he wa overwhelm
what made me think he reflect as he went under the gatewai what
made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment
why why why did i assum thi so certainli
he wa crush and even humili he could have laugh at himself in
hi anger a dull anim rage boil within him
he stood hesit in the gatewai to go into the street to go a walk
for appear sake wa revolt to go back to hi room even more
revolt and what a chanc i have lost for ever he mutter
stand aimlessli in the gatewai just opposit the porter littl
dark room which wa also open suddenli he start from the porter
room two pace awai from him someth shine under the bench to the
right caught hi ey he look about himnobodi he approach the
room on tipto went down two step into it and in a faint voic call
the porter ye not at home somewher near though in the yard for
the door is wide open he dash to the ax it wa an ax and pull
it out from under the bench where it lai between two chunk of wood
at onc befor go out he made it fast in the noos he thrust both
hand into hi pocket and went out of the room no on had notic him
when reason fail the devil help he thought with a strang grin
thi chanc rais hi spirit extraordinarili
he walk along quietli and sedat without hurri to avoid awaken
suspicion he scarc look at the passersbi tri to escap look
at their face at all and to be as littl notic as possibl
suddenli he thought of hi hat good heaven i had the monei the dai
befor yesterdai and did not get a cap to wear instead a curs rose
from the bottom of hi soul
glanc out of the corner of hi ey into a shop he saw by a clock on
the wall that it wa ten minut past seven he had to make hast and at
the same time to go somewai round so as to approach the hous from the
other side
when he had happen to imagin all thi beforehand he had sometim
thought that he would be veri much afraid but he wa not veri much
afraid now wa not afraid at all inde hi mind wa even occupi
by irrelev matter but by noth for long as he pass the yusupov
garden he wa deepli absorb in consid the build of great
fountain and of their refresh effect on the atmospher in all
the squar by degre he pass to the convict that if the summer
garden were extend to the field of mar and perhap join to the
garden of the mihailovski palac it would be a splendid thing and a
great benefit to the town then he wa interest by the question why
in all great town men ar not simpli driven by necess but in some
peculiar wai inclin to live in those part of the town where there
ar no garden nor fountain where there is most dirt and smell and all
sort of nasti then hi own walk through the hai market came back
to hi mind and for a moment he wake up to realiti what nonsens
he thought better think of noth at all
so probabl men led to execut clutch mental at everi object that
meet them on the wai flash through hi mind but simpli flash
like lightn he made hast to dismiss thi thought and by now
he wa near here wa the hous here wa the gate suddenli a clock
somewher struck onc what can it be halfpast seven imposs it
must be fast
luckili for him everyth went well again at the gate at that veri
moment as though expressli for hi benefit a huge waggon of hai had
just driven in at the gate complet screen him as he pass under
the gatewai and the waggon had scarc had time to drive through into
the yard befor he had slip in a flash to the right on the other
side of the waggon he could hear shout and quarrel but no on
notic him and no on met him mani window look into that huge
quadrangular yard were open at that moment but he did not rais hi
headh had not the strength to the staircas lead to the old
woman room wa close by just on the right of the gatewai he wa
alreadi on the stair
draw a breath press hi hand against hi throb heart and
onc more feel for the ax and set it straight he began softli
and cautious ascend the stair listen everi minut but the
stair too were quit desert all the door were shut he met no
on on flat inde on the first floor wa wide open and painter were
at work in it but thei did not glanc at him he stood still thought
a minut and went on of cours it would be better if thei had not been
here but it two storei abov them
and there wa the fourth storei here wa the door here wa the
flat opposit the empti on the flat underneath the old woman wa
appar empti also the visit card nail on the door had been
torn offthei had gone awai he wa out of breath for on instant
the thought float through hi mind shall i go back but he made no
answer and began listen at the old woman door a dead silenc then
he listen again on the staircas listen long and intent
then look about him for the last time pull himself togeth drew
himself up and onc more tri the ax in the noos am i veri pale
he wonder am i not evid agit she is mistrust had i
better wait a littl longer till my heart leav off thump
but hi heart did not leav off on the contrari as though to spite
him it throb more and more violent he could stand it no longer
he slowli put out hi hand to the bell and rang half a minut later he
rang again more loudli
no answer to go on ring wa useless and out of place the old woman
wa of cours at home but she wa suspici and alon he had some
knowledg of her habit and onc more he put hi ear to the door
either hi sens were peculiarli keen which it is difficult to
suppos or the sound wa realli veri distinct anywai he suddenli
heard someth like the cautiou touch of a hand on the lock and the
rustl of a skirt at the veri door someon wa stand stealthili
close to the lock and just as he wa do on the outsid wa secretli
listen within and seem to have her ear to the door he move
a littl on purpos and mutter someth aloud that he might not have
the appear of hide then rang a third time but quietli soberli
and without impati recal it afterward that moment stood out
in hi mind vividli distinctli for ever he could not make out how he
had had such cun for hi mind wa as it were cloud at moment and
he wa almost unconsci of hi bodi an instant later he heard the
latch unfasten
chapter vii
the door wa as befor open a tini crack and again two sharp and
suspici ey stare at him out of the dark then raskolnikov lost
hi head and nearli made a great mistak
fear the old woman would be frighten by their be alon and not
hope that the sight of him would disarm her suspicion he took
hold of the door and drew it toward him to prevent the old woman from
attempt to shut it again see thi she did not pull the door back
but she did not let go the handl so that he almost drag her out with
it on to the stair see that she wa stand in the doorwai not
allow him to pass he advanc straight upon her she step back
in alarm tri to sai someth but seem unabl to speak and stare
with open ey at him
good even alyona ivanovna he began try to speak easili but
hi voic would not obei him it broke and shook i have come i have
brought someth but wed better come in to the light
and leav her he pass straight into the room uninvit the old
woman ran after him her tongu wa unloos

and overcoat without examin or undo the parcel and case but he
had not time to take mani
he suddenli heard step in the room where the old woman lai he stop
short and wa still as death but all wa quiet so it must have been
hi fanci all at onc he heard distinctli a faint cry as though
someon had utter a low broken moan then again dead silenc for
a minut or two he sat squat on hi heel by the box and wait
hold hi breath suddenli he jump up seiz the ax and ran out of
the bedroom
in the middl of the room stood lizaveta with a big bundl in her arm
she wa gaze in stupefact at her murder sister white as a sheet
and seem not to have the strength to cry out see him run out
of the bedroom she began faintli quiver all over like a leaf a
shudder ran down her face she lift her hand open her mouth but
still did not scream she began slowli back awai from him into the
corner stare intent persist at him but still utter no
sound as though she could not get breath to scream he rush at her
with the ax her mouth twitch piteous as on see babi mouth
when thei begin to be frighten stare intent at what frighten them
and ar on the point of scream and thi hapless lizaveta wa so
simpl and had been so thoroughli crush and scare that she did not
even rais a hand to guard her face though that wa the most necessari
and natur action at the moment for the ax wa rais over her face

fear gain more and more masteri over him especi after thi
second quit unexpect murder he long to run awai from the place
as fast as possibl and if at that moment he had been capabl of see
and reason more correctli if he had been abl to realis all the
difficulti of hi posit the hopeless the hideous and the
absurd of it if he could have understood how mani obstacl and
perhap crime he had still to overcom or to commit to get out of
that place and to make hi wai home it is veri possibl that he would
have flung up everyth and would have gone to give himself up and
not from fear but from simpl horror and loath of what he had
done the feel of loath especi surg up within him and grew
stronger everi minut he would not now have gone to the box or even

come now you ar harsh mutter nikodim fomitch sit down at
the tabl and also begin to write he look a littl asham
write said the head clerk to raskolnikov
write what the latter ask gruffli
i will dictat to you
raskolnikov fanci that the head clerk treat him more casual and
contemptu after hi speech but strang to sai he suddenli felt
complet indiffer to anyon opinion and thi revuls took
place in a flash in on instant if he had care to think a littl
he would have been amaz inde that he could have talk to them like
that a minut befor forc hi feel upon them and where had
those feel come from now if the whole room had been fill not
with polic offic but with those nearest and dearest to him he
would not have found on human word for them so empti wa hi heart a
gloomi sensat of agonis everlast solitud and remot took
consciou form in hi soul it wa not the mean of hi sentiment
effus befor ilya petrovitch nor the mean of the latter
triumph over him that had caus thi sudden revuls in hi heart
oh what had he to do now with hi own base with all these petti
vaniti offic german women debt policeoffic if he had been
sentenc to be burnt at that moment he would not have stir would
hardli have heard the sentenc to the end someth wa happen to
him entir new sudden and unknown it wa not that he understood but
he felt clearli with all the intens of sensat that he could
never more appeal to these peopl in the policeoffic with sentiment
effus like hi recent outburst or with anyth whatev and that
if thei had been hi own brother and sister and not policeoffic
it would have been utterli out of the question to appeal to them in ani
circumst of life he had never experienc such a strang and aw
sensat and what wa most agonisingit wa more a sensat than a
concept or idea a direct sensat the most agonis of all the
sensat he had known in hi life
the head clerk began dictat to him the usual form of declar
that he could not pai that he undertook to do so at a futur date that
he would not leav the town nor sell hi properti and so on
but you cant write you can hardli hold the pen observ the head
clerk look with curios at raskolnikov ar you ill
ye i am giddi go on
that all sign it
the head clerk took the paper and turn to attend to other
raskolnikov gave back the pen but instead of get up and go awai
he put hi elbow on the tabl and press hi head in hi hand he
felt as if a nail were be driven into hi skull a strang idea
suddenli occur to him to get up at onc to go up to nikodim
fomitch and tell him everyth that had happen yesterdai and then
to go with him to hi lodg and to show him the thing in the hole
in the corner the impuls wa so strong that he got up from hi seat
to carri it out hadnt i better think a minut flash through hi
mind no better cast off the burden without think but all at onc
he stood still root to the spot nikodim fomitch wa talk eagerli
with ilya petrovitch and the word reach him
it imposs theyll both be releas to begin with the whole
stori contradict itself why should thei have call the porter if it
had been their do to inform against themselv or as a blind no
that would be too cun besid pestryakov the student wa seen at
the gate by both the porter and a woman as he went in he wa walk
with three friend who left him onli at the gate and he ask the
porter to direct him in the presenc of the friend now would he
have ask hi wai if he had been go with such an object as for
koch he spent half an hour at the silversmith below befor he went
up to the old woman and he left him at exactli a quarter to eight now
just consid
but excus me how do you explain thi contradict thei state
themselv that thei knock and the door wa lock yet three minut
later when thei went up with the porter it turn out the door wa
unfasten
that just it the murder must have been there and bolt himself
in and theyd have caught him for a certainti if koch had not been
an ass and gone to look for the porter too he must have seiz the
interv to get downstair and slip by them somehow koch keep cross
himself and sai if i had been there he would have jump out and
kill me with hi ax he is go to have a thanksgiv serviceha
ha
and no on saw the murder
thei might well not see him the hous is a regular noah ark said
the head clerk who wa listen
it clear quit clear nikodim fomitch repeat warmli
no it is anyth but clear ilya petrovitch maintain
raskolnikov pick up hi hat and walk toward the door but he did
not reach it
when he recov conscious he found himself sit in a chair
support by someon on the right side while someon els wa stand
on the left hold a yellowish glass fill with yellow water and
nikodim fomitch stand befor him look intent at him he got up
from the chair
what thi ar you ill nikodim fomitch ask rather sharpli
he could hardli hold hi pen when he wa sign said the head clerk
settl back in hi place and take up hi work again
have you been ill long cri ilya petrovitch from hi place where
he too wa look through paper he had of cours come to look at
the sick man when he faint but retir at onc when he recov
sinc yesterdai mutter raskolnikov in repli
did you go out yesterdai
ye
though you were ill
ye
at what time
about seven
and where did you go mai i ask
along the street
short and clear
raskolnikov white as a handkerchief had answer sharpli jerkili
without drop hi black feverish ey befor ilya petrovitch stare
he can scarc stand upright and you nikodim fomitch wa
begin
no matter ilya petrovitch pronounc rather peculiarli
nikodim fomitch would have made some further protest but glanc at
the head clerk who wa look veri hard at him he did not speak there
wa a sudden silenc it wa strang
veri well then conclud ilya petrovitch we will not detain you
raskolnikov went out he caught the sound of eager convers on hi
departur and abov the rest rose the question voic of nikodim
fomitch in the street hi faint pass off complet
a searchther will be a search at onc he repeat to himself
hurri home the brute thei suspect
hi former terror master him complet again
chapter ii
and what if there ha been a search alreadi what if i find them in my
room
but here wa hi room noth and no on in it no on had peep in
even nastasya had not touch it but heaven how could he have left
all those thing in the hole
he rush to the corner slip hi hand under the paper pull the
thing out and line hi pocket with them there were eight articl in
all two littl box with ear or someth of the sort he hardli
look to see then four small leather case there wa a chain too
mere wrap in newspap and someth els in newspap that look
like a decor he put them all in the differ pocket of hi
overcoat and the remain pocket of hi trouser try to conceal
them as much as possibl he took the purs too then he went out of
hi room leav the door open he walk quickli and resolut and
though he felt shatter he had hi sens about him he wa afraid of
pursuit he wa afraid that in anoth halfhour anoth quarter of an
hour perhap instruct would be issu for hi pursuit and so at
all cost he must hide all trace befor then he must clear everyth
up while he still had some strength some reason power left him
where wa he to go
that had long been settl fling them into the canal and all trace
hidden in the water the thing would be at an end so he had decid in
the night of hi delirium when sever time he had had the impuls to
get up and go awai to make hast and get rid of it all but to get
rid of it turn out to be a veri difficult task he wander along
the bank of the ekaterininski canal for half an hour or more and look
sever time at the step run down to the water but he could not
think of carri out hi plan either raft stood at the step edg
and women were wash cloth on them or boat were moor there and
peopl were swarm everywher moreov he could be seen and notic
from the bank on all side it would look suspici for a man to go
down on purpos stop and throw someth into the water and what if
the box were to float instead of sink and of cours thei would
even as it wa everyon he met seem to stare and look round as if
thei had noth to do but to watch him why is it or can it be my
fanci he thought
at last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the
neva there were not so mani peopl there he would be less observ
and it would be more conveni in everi wai abov all it wa further
off he wonder how he could have been wander for a good halfhour
worri and anxiou in thi danger past without think of it
befor and that halfhour he had lost over an irrat plan simpli
becaus he had thought of it in delirium he had becom extrem absent
and forget and he wa awar of it he certainli must make hast
he walk toward the neva along v prospect but on the wai
anoth idea struck him why to the neva would it not be better to go
somewher far off to the island again and there hide the thing
in some solitari place in a wood or under a bush and mark the spot
perhap and though he felt incap of clear judgment the idea
seem to him a sound on but he wa not destin to go there for
come out of v prospect toward the squar he saw on the left a
passag lead between two blank wall to a courtyard on the right
hand the blank unwhitewash wall of a fourstori hous stretch far
into the court on the left a wooden hoard ran parallel with it for
twenti pace into the court and then turn sharpli to the left here
wa a desert fencedoff place where rubbish of differ sort wa
ly at the end of the court the corner of a low smutti stone shed
appar part of some workshop peep from behind the hoard it
wa probabl a carriag builder or carpent shed the whole place
from the entranc wa black with coal dust here would be the place to
throw it he thought not see anyon in the yard he slip in and
at onc saw near the gate a sink such as is often put in yard where
there ar mani workmen or cabdriv and on the hoard abov had
been scribbl in chalk the timehonour wittic stand here
strictli forbidden thi wa all the better for there would be noth
suspici about hi go in here i could throw it all in a heap and
get awai
look round onc more with hi hand alreadi in hi pocket he notic
against the outer wall between the entranc and the sink a big unhewn
stone weigh perhap sixti pound the other side of the wall wa a
street he could hear passersbi alwai numer in that part but he
could not be seen from the entranc unless someon came in from the
street which might well happen inde so there wa need of hast
he bent down over the stone seiz the top of it firmli in both hand
and us all hi strength turn it over under the stone wa a small
hollow in the ground and he immedi empti hi pocket into it
the purs lai at the top and yet the hollow wa not fill up then he
seiz the stone again and with on twist turn it back so that it wa
in the same posit again though it stood a veri littl higher but
he scrape the earth about it and press it at the edg with hi foot
noth could be notic
then he went out and turn into the squar again an intens
almost unbear joi overwhelm him for an instant as it had in
the policeoffic i have buri my track and who who can think of
look under that stone it ha been ly there most like ever sinc
the hous wa built and will lie as mani year more and if it were
found who would think of me it is all over no clue and he laugh
ye he rememb that he began laugh a thin nervou noiseless
laugh and went on laugh all the time he wa cross the squar but
when he reach the k boulevard where two dai befor he had come
upon that girl hi laughter suddenli ceas other idea crept into hi
mind he felt all at onc that it would be loathsom to pass that seat
on which after the girl wa gone he had sat and ponder and that it
would be hate too to meet that whisker policeman to whom he had
given the twenti copeck damn him
he walk look about him angrili and distractedli all hi idea now
seem to be circl round some singl point and he felt that there
realli wa such a point and that now now he wa left face that
pointand for the first time inde dure the last two month
damn it all he thought suddenli in a fit of ungovern furi
if it ha begun then it ha begun hang the new life good lord how

turn face the neva look toward the palac the sky wa without
a cloud and the water wa almost bright blue which is so rare in the
neva the cupola of the cathedr which is seen at it best from the
bridg about twenti pace from the chapel glitter in the sunlight
and in the pure air everi ornament on it could be clearli distinguish
the pain from the lash went off and raskolnikov forgot about it on

everi time at hi sombr and enigmat impress and mistrust
himself put off find the explan of it he vividli recal
those old doubt and perplex and it seem to him that it wa

place i soon got to know all your affairsal all brother i know
everyth nastasya here will tell you i made the acquaint of
nikodim fomitch and ilya petrovitch and the houseport and mr
zametov alexandr grigorievitch the head clerk in the polic offic

he got round her nastasya murmur smile slyli
why dont you put the sugar in your tea nastasya nikiforovna
you ar a on nastasya cri suddenli go off into a giggl i am
not nikiforovna but petrovna she ad suddenli recov from her
mirth
ill make a note of it well brother to make a long stori short
i wa go in for a regular explos here to uproot all malign
influenc in the local but pashenka won the dai i had not
expect brother to find her so prepossess eh what do you
think
raskolnikov did not speak but he still kept hi ey fix upon him
full of alarm
and all that could be wish inde in everi respect razumihin went
on not at all embarrass by hi silenc
ah the sly dog nastasya shriek again thi convers afford
her unspeak delight
it a piti brother that you did not set to work in the right wai
at first you ought to have approach her differ she is so
to speak a most unaccount charact but we will talk about her
charact later how could you let thing come to such a pass that
she gave up send you your dinner and that i o u you must have been
mad to sign an i o u and that promis of marriag when her daughter
natalya yegorovna wa aliv i know all about it but i see that
a delic matter and i am an ass forgiv me but talk of
foolish do you know praskovya pavlovna is not nearli so foolish as
you would think at first sight
no mumbl raskolnikov look awai but feel that it wa better
to keep up the convers
she isnt is she cri razumihin delight to get an answer out
of him but she is not veri clever either eh she is essenti
essenti an unaccount charact i am sometim quit at a loss
i assur you she must be forti she sai she is thirtysix and
of cours she ha everi right to sai so but i swear i judg her
intellectu simpli from the metaphys point of view there is a
sort of symbol sprung up between us a sort of algebra or what not
i dont understand it well that all nonsens onli see that you
ar not a student now and have lost your lesson and your cloth and
that through the young ladi death she ha no need to treat you as
a relat she suddenli took fright and as you hid in your den and
drop all your old relat with her she plan to get rid of you
and she been cherish that design a long time but wa sorri to lose
the i o u for you assur her yourself that your mother would pai
it wa base of me to sai that my mother herself is almost
a beggar and i told a lie to keep my lodg and be fed
raskolnikov said loudli and distinctli
ye you did veri sensibl but the worst of it is that at that point
mr tchebarov turn up a busi man pashenka would never have
thought of do anyth on her own account she is too retir but
the busi man is by no mean retir and first thing he put the
question is there ani hope of realis the i o u answer there is
becaus he ha a mother who would save her rodya with her hundr and
twentyf roubl pension if she ha to starv herself and a sister
too who would go into bondag for hi sake that what he wa build
upon why do you start i know all the in and out of your affair
now my dear boyit not for noth that you were so open with
pashenka when you were her prospect soninlaw and i sai all thi as
a friend but i tell you what it is an honest and sensit man is
open and a busi man listen and goe on eat you up well
then she gave the i o u by wai of payment to thi tchebarov and without
hesit he made a formal demand for payment when i heard of all thi
i want to blow him up too to clear my conscienc but by that time
harmoni reign between me and pashenka and i insist on stop
the whole affair engag that you would pai i went secur for you

roubl and got the i o u back from him and here i have the honour of
present it to you she trust your word now here take it you see i

i should like to know what
why it all about a housepaint we ar get him out of
a mess though inde there noth to fear now the matter is
absolut selfevid we onli put on steam
a painter
why havent i told you about it i onli told you the begin then
about the murder of the old pawnbrokerwoman well the painter is mix
up in it
oh i heard about that murder befor and wa rather interest in it
partli for on reason i read about it in the paper too
lizaveta wa murder too nastasya blurt out suddenli address
raskolnikov she remain in the room all the time stand by the door
listen
lizaveta murmur raskolnikov hardli audibl
lizaveta who sold old cloth didnt you know her she us to come
here she mend a shirt for you too
raskolnikov turn to the wall where in the dirti yellow paper he
pick out on clumsi white flower with brown line on it and began
examin how mani petal there were in it how mani scallop in the
petal and how mani line on them he felt hi arm and leg as lifeless
as though thei had been cut off he did not attempt to move but stare
obstin at the flower
but what about the painter zossimov interrupt nastasya chatter
with mark displeasur she sigh and wa silent
why he wa accus of the murder razumihin went on hotli
wa there evid against him then
evid inde evid that wa no evid and that what we
have to prove it wa just as thei pitch on those fellow koch and
pestryakov at first foo how stupidli it all done it make on
sick though it not on busi pestryakov mai be come
tonight by the wai rodya youv heard about the busi alreadi
it happen befor you were ill the dai befor you faint at the
polic offic while thei were talk about it
zossimov look curious at raskolnikov he did not stir
but i sai razumihin i wonder at you what a busybodi you ar
zossimov observ
mayb i am but we will get him off anywai shout razumihin
bring hi fist down on the tabl what the most offens is not
their lyingon can alwai forgiv lyingli is a delight thing
for it lead to truthwhat is offens is that thei lie and worship
their own ly i respect porfiri but what threw them out at
first the door wa lock and when thei came back with the porter
it wa open so it follow that koch and pestryakov were the
murderersthat wa their logic
but dont excit yourself thei simpli detain them thei could not
help that and by the wai iv met that man koch he us to bui
unredeem pledg from the old woman eh
ye he is a swindler he bui up bad debt too he make a profess
of it but enough of him do you know what make me angri it their
sicken rotten petrifi routin and thi case might be the mean
of introduc a new method on can show from the psycholog data
alon how to get on the track of the real man we have fact thei
sai but fact ar not everythingat least half the busi li in
how you interpret them
can you interpret them then
anywai on cant hold on tongu when on ha a feel a tangibl
feel that on might be a help if onli eh do you know the
detail of the case
i am wait to hear about the painter
oh ye well here the stori earli on the third dai after the
murder when thei were still dandl koch and pestryakovthough thei
account for everi step thei took and it wa as plain as a pikestaffan
unexpect fact turn up a peasant call dushkin who keep a
dramshop face the hous brought to the polic offic a jewel
case contain some gold ear and told a long rigamarol the
dai befor yesterdai just after eight oclockmark the dai and the
houra journeyman housepaint nikolai who had been in to see me

ask me to give him two roubl for them when i ask him where he got
them he said that he pick them up in the street i did not ask him
anyth more i am tell you dushkin stori i gave him a notea
roubl that isfor i thought if he did not pawn it with me he would
with anoth it would all come to the same thingh spend it on

the quicker you will find it and if anyth turn up if i hear ani
rumour ill take it to the polic of cours that all taradiddl
he li like a hors for i know thi dushkin he is a pawnbrok and
a receiv of stolen good and he did not cheat nikolai out of a
thirtyroubl trinket in order to give it to the polic he wa simpli
afraid but no matter to return to dushkin stori iv known
thi peasant nikolai dementyev from a child he come from the same
provinc and district of zarask we ar both ryazan men and though
nikolai is not a drunkard he drink and i knew he had a job in that
hous paint work with dmitri who come from the same villag too
as soon as he got the roubl he chang it had a coupl of glass
took hi chang and went out but i did not see dmitri with him then

i were paint there all dai and we were just get readi to go and
dmitri took a brush and paint my face and he ran off and i after him

were there i dont rememb and the porter swore at me and the other
porter swore too and the porter wife came out and swore at us too
and a gentleman came into the entri with a ladi and he swore at us
too for dmitri and i lai right across the wai i got hold of dmitri
hair and knock him down and began beat him and dmitri too caught
me by the hair and began beat me but we did it all not for temper
but in a friendli wai for sport and then dmitri escap and ran into
the street and i ran after him but i did not catch him and went back
to the flat alon i had to clear up my thing i began put them
togeth expect dmitri to come and there in the passag in the
corner by the door i step on the box i saw it ly there wrap
up in paper i took off the paper saw some littl hook undid them
and in the box were the ear
behind the door ly behind the door behind the door raskolnikov
cri suddenli stare with a blank look of terror at razumihin and he
slowli sat up on the sofa lean on hi hand
ye why what the matter what wrong razumihin too got up
from hi seat
noth raskolnikov answer faintli turn to the wall all were
silent for a while
he must have wake from a dream razumihin said at last look
inquiringli at zossimov the latter slightli shook hi head
well go on said zossimov what next
what next as soon as he saw the ear forget dmitri and
everyth he took up hi cap and ran to dushkin and as we know got
a roubl from him he told a lie sai he found them in the street and
went off drink he keep repeat hi old stori about the murder
i know noth of it never heard of it till the dai befor yesterdai
and why didnt you come to the polic till now i wa frighten
and why did you try to hang yourself from anxieti what anxieti
that i should be accus of it well that the whole stori and now
what do you suppos thei deduc from that
why there no suppos there a clue such as it is a fact you
wouldnt have your painter set free
now theyv simpli taken him for the murder thei havent a shadow of
doubt
that nonsens you ar excit but what about the ear you
must admit that if on the veri same dai and hour ear from the old
woman box have come into nikolai hand thei must have come there
somehow that a good deal in such a case
how did thei get there how did thei get there cri razumihin
how can you a doctor whose duti it is to studi man and who ha more
opportun than anyon els for studi human naturehow can you fail
to see the charact of the man in the whole stori dont you see at
onc that the answer he ha given in the examin ar the holi
truth thei came into hi hand precis as he ha told ush step
on the box and pick it up
the holi truth but didnt he own himself that he told a lie at first
listen to me listen attent the porter and koch and pestryakov
and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who
wa sit in the porter lodg and the man kryukov who had just got
out of a cab at that minut and went in at the entri with a ladi on hi
arm that is eight or ten wit agre that nikolai had dmitri on
the ground wa ly on him beat him while dmitri hung on to hi
hair beat him too thei lai right across the wai block the
thoroughfar thei were sworn at on all side while thei like children
the veri word of the wit were fall over on anoth
squeal fight and laugh with the funniest face and chase
on anoth like children thei ran into the street now take care
note the bodi upstair were warm you understand warm when thei
found them if thei or nikolai alon had murder them and broken open
the box or simpli taken part in the robberi allow me to ask you on
question do their state of mind their squeal and giggl and childish
scuffl at the gate fit in with ax bloodsh fiendish cun
robberi theyd just kill them not five or ten minut befor for
the bodi were still warm and at onc leav the flat open know
that peopl would go there at onc fling awai their booti thei
roll about like children laugh and attract gener attent
and there ar a dozen wit to swear to that
of cours it is strang it imposs inde but
no brother no but and if the ear be found in nikolai
hand at the veri dai and hour of the murder constitut an import
piec of circumstanti evid against himalthough the explan
given by him account for it and therefor it doe not tell serious
against himon must take into consider the fact which prove him
innoc especi as thei ar fact that cannot be deni and
do you suppos from the charact of our legal system that thei will
accept or that thei ar in a posit to accept thi factrest
simpli on a psycholog impossibilitya irrefut and conclus
break down the circumstanti evid for the prosecut no thei
wont accept it thei certainli wont becaus thei found the jewelcas
and the man tri to hang himself which he could not have done if he
hadnt felt guilti that the point that what excit me you must
understand
oh i see you ar excit wait a bit i forgot to ask you what proof
is there that the box came from the old woman
that been prove said razumihin with appar reluct frown
koch recognis the jewelcas and gave the name of the owner who
prove conclus that it wa hi
that bad now anoth point did anyon see nikolai at the time
that koch and pestryakov were go upstair at first and is there no
evid about that
nobodi did see him razumihin answer with vexat that the
worst of it even koch and pestryakov did not notic them on their wai
upstair though inde their evid could not have been worth much
thei said thei saw the flat wa open and that there must be work go
on in it but thei took no special notic and could not rememb whether
there actual were men at work in it
hm so the onli evid for the defenc is that thei were beat
on anoth and laugh that constitut a strong presumpt but
how do you explain the fact yourself
how do i explain them what is there to explain it clear at ani
rate the direct in which explan is to be sought is clear and
the jewelcas point to it the real murder drop those ear
the murder wa upstair lock in when koch and pestryakov knock
at the door koch like an ass did not stai at the door so the
murder pop out and ran down too for he had no other wai of
escap he hid from koch pestryakov and the porter in the flat when
nikolai and dmitri had just run out of it he stop there while the
porter and other were go upstair wait till thei were out of
hear and then went calmli downstair at the veri minut when dmitri
and nikolai ran out into the street and there wa no on in the entri
possibl he wa seen but not notic there ar lot of peopl go
in and out he must have drop the ear out of hi pocket when
he stood behind the door and did not notic he drop them becaus he
had other thing to think of the jewelcas is a conclus proof that
he did stand there that how i explain it
too clever no my boi your too clever that beat everyth
but why why
why becaus everyth fit too well it too melodramat
aach razumihin wa exclaim but at that moment the door open
and a personag came in who wa a stranger to all present
chapter v
thi wa a gentleman no longer young of a stiff and portli appear
and a cautiou and sour counten he began by stop short in the
doorwai stare about him with offens and undisguis astonish
as though ask himself what sort of place he had come to
mistrustfulli and with an affect of be alarm and almost
affront he scan raskolnikov low and narrow cabin with the

took place reflect probabl from certain fairli unmistak sign
that he would get noth in thi cabin by attempt to overaw them
the gentleman soften somewhat and civilli though with some sever
emphasis everi syllabl of hi question address zossimov
rodion romanovitch raskolnikov a student or formerli a student
zossimov made a slight movement and would have answer had not
razumihin anticip him
here he is ly on the sofa what do you want
thi familiar what do you want seem to cut the ground from the
feet of the pompou gentleman he wa turn to razumihin but check
himself in time and turn to zossimov again

in repli raskolnikov sank languidli back on the pillow put hi hand
behind hi head and gaze at the ceil a look of dismai came into

he ha been consciou a long time sinc the morn went on
razumihin whose familiar seem so much like unaffect goodnatur
that pyotr petrovitch began to be more cheer partli perhap

so you ar the fianc i know and that enough
there wa no doubt about pyotr petrovitch be offend thi time
but he said noth he made a violent effort to understand what it all
meant there wa a moment silenc
meanwhil raskolnikov who had turn a littl toward him when he
answer began suddenli stare at him again with mark curios as
though he had not had a good look at him yet or as though someth
new had struck him he rose from hi pillow on purpos to stare at
him there certainli wa someth peculiar in pyotr petrovitch whole
appear someth which seem to justifi the titl of fianc so
unceremoni appli to him in the first place it wa evid far
too much so inde that pyotr petrovitch had made eager us of hi few
dai in the capit to get himself up and rig himself out in expect
of hi betrotheda perfectli innoc and permiss proceed
inde even hi own perhap too complac conscious of the
agreeabl improv in hi appear might have been forgiven in such
circumst see that pyotr petrovitch had taken up the rle of
fianc all hi cloth were fresh from the tailor and were all
right except for be too new and too distinctli appropri even
the stylish new round hat had the same signific pyotr petrovitch
treat it too respectfulli and held it too carefulli in hi hand the
exquisit pair of lavend glove real louvain told the same tale
if onli from the fact of hi not wear them but carri them in
hi hand for show light and youth colour predomin in pyotr

goodlook and impos counten it wa due to quit other
caus after scan mr luzhin unceremoni raskolnikov smile
malignantli sank back on the pillow and stare at the ceil as
befor
but mr luzhin harden hi heart and seem to determin to take no
notic of their odditi
i feel the greatest regret at find you in thi situat he began
again break the silenc with an effort if i had been awar of your
ill i should have come earlier but you know what busi is i
have too a veri import legal affair in the senat not to mention
other preoccup which you mai well conjectur i am expect your

raskolnikov made a movement and seem about to speak hi face show

charact thing have happen there and there ar all sort of queer
peopl live there and i went there about a scandal busi it
cheap though
i could not of cours find out so much about it for i am a stranger
in petersburg myself pyotr petrovitch repli huffili howev the
two room ar exceedingli clean and as it is for so short a time
i have alreadi taken a perman that is our futur flat he said
address raskolnikov and i am have it done up and meanwhil i am
myself cramp for room in a lodg with my friend andrei semyonovitch
lebeziatnikov in the flat of madam lippevechsel it wa he who told me
of bakaleyev hous too
lebeziatnikov said raskolnikov slowli as if recal someth

excus me i fanci so from your inquiri i wa onc hi guardian
a veri nice young man and advanc i like to meet young peopl on
learn new thing from them luzhin look round hopefulli at them all
how do you mean ask razumihin
in the most seriou and essenti matter pyotr petrovitch repli
as though delight at the question you see it ten year sinc i
visit petersburg all the novelti reform idea have reach us in
the provinc but to see it all more clearli on must be in petersburg
and it my notion that you observ and learn most by watch the
younger gener and i confess i am delight
at what
your question is a wide on i mai be mistaken but i fanci i find
clearer view more so to sai critic more practic
that true zossimov let drop
nonsens there no practic razumihin flew at him
practic is a difficult thing to find it doe not drop down from
heaven and for the last two hundr year we have been divorc from
all practic life idea if you like ar ferment he said to
pyotr petrovitch and desir for good exist though it in a childish
form and honesti you mai find although there ar crowd of brigand
anywai there no practic practic goe well shod
i dont agre with you pyotr petrovitch repli with evid
enjoy of cours peopl do get carri awai and make mistak
but on must have indulg those mistak ar mere evid of
enthusiasm for the caus and of abnorm extern environ if littl
ha been done the time ha been but short of mean i will not speak
it my person view if you care to know that someth ha been
accomplish alreadi new valuabl idea new valuabl work ar
circul in the place of our old dreami and romant author
literatur is take a matur form mani injuri prejudic have been
root up and turn into ridicul in a word we have cut ourselv
off irrevoc from the past and that to my think is a great
thing
he learnt it by heart to show off raskolnikov pronounc suddenli
what ask pyotr petrovitch not catch hi word but he receiv
no repli
that all true zossimov hasten to interpos
isnt it so pyotr petrovitch went on glanc affabl at zossimov
you must admit he went on address razumihin with a shade of
triumph and superciliousnessh almost ad young manthat there
is an advanc or as thei sai now progress in the name of scienc and
econom truth
a commonplac
no not a commonplac hitherto for instanc if i were told love
thy neighbour what came of it pyotr petrovitch went on perhap with
excess hast it came to my tear my coat in half to share with my
neighbour and we both were left half nake as a russian proverb ha
it catch sever hare and you wont catch on scienc now tell
us love yourself befor all men for everyth in the world rest on
selfinterest you love yourself and manag your own affair properli
and your coat remain whole econom truth add that the better privat
affair ar organis in societyth more whole coat so to sayth
firmer ar it foundat and the better is the common welfar
organis too therefor in acquir wealth sole and exclus for
myself i am acquir so to speak for all and help to bring to
pass my neighbour get a littl more than a torn coat and that not
from privat person liber but as a consequ of the gener
advanc the idea is simpl but unhappili it ha been a long time
reach us be hinder by ideal and sentiment and yet it
would seem to want veri littl wit to perceiv it
excus me iv veri littl wit myself razumihin cut in sharpli
and so let us drop it i began thi discuss with an object but iv
grown so sick dure the last three year of thi chatter to amus
oneself of thi incess flow of commonplac alwai the same that
by jove i blush even when other peopl talk like that you ar in a
hurri no doubt to exhibit your acquir and i dont blame you
that quit pardon i onli want to find out what sort of man you
ar for so mani unscrupul peopl have got hold of the progress
caus of late and have so distort in their own interest everyth
thei touch that the whole caus ha been drag in the mire that
enough
excus me sir said luzhin affront and speak with excess
digniti do you mean to suggest so unceremoni that i too
oh my dear sir how could i come that enough razumihin
conclud and he turn abruptli to zossimov to continu their previou
convers
pyotr petrovitch had the good sens to accept the disavow he made up
hi mind to take leav in anoth minut or two
i trust our acquaint he said address raskolnikov mai upon
your recoveri and in view of the circumst of which you ar awar
becom closer abov all i hope for your return to health
raskolnikov did not even turn hi head pyotr petrovitch began get
up from hi chair
on of her custom must have kill her zossimov declar
posit
not a doubt of it repli razumihin porfiri doesnt give hi
opinion but is examin all who have left pledg with her there
examin them raskolnikov ask aloud
ye what then
noth
how doe he get hold of them ask zossimov
koch ha given the name of some of them other name ar on the
wrapper of the pledg and some have come forward of themselv
it must have been a cun and practis ruffian the bold of it
the cool
that just what it wasnt interpos razumihin that what throw
you all off the scent but i maintain that he is not cun not
practis and probabl thi wa hi first crime the supposit that
it wa a calcul crime and a cun crimin doesnt work suppos
him to have been inexperienc and it clear that it wa onli a chanc
that save himand chanc mai do anyth why he did not forese
obstacl perhap and how did he set to work he took jewel worth
ten or twenti roubl stuf hi pocket with them ransack the
old woman trunk her ragsand thei found fifteen hundr roubl
besid note in a box in the top drawer of the chest he did not know
how to rob he could onli murder it wa hi first crime i assur you
hi first crime he lost hi head and he got off more by luck than good
counsel
you ar talk of the murder of the old pawnbrok i believ pyotr
petrovitch put in address zossimov he wa stand hat and glove
in hand but befor depart he felt dispos to throw off a few more
intellectu phrase he wa evid anxiou to make a favour
impress and hi vaniti overcam hi prudenc
ye youv heard of it
oh ye be in the neighbourhood
do you know the detail
i cant sai that but anoth circumst interest me in the
caseth whole question so to sai not to speak of the fact that crime
ha been greatli on the increas among the lower class dure the last
five year not to speak of the case of robberi and arson everywher
what strike me as the strangest thing is that in the higher class
too crime is increas proportion in on place on hear of a
student rob the mail on the high road in anoth place peopl of
good social posit forg fals banknot in moscow of late a whole
gang ha been captur who us to forg lotteri ticket and on of
the ringlead wa a lectur in univers histori then our secretari
abroad wa murder from some obscur motiv of gain and if thi old
woman the pawnbrok ha been murder by someon of a higher class
in societyfor peasant dont pawn gold trinketshow ar we to explain
thi demoralis of the civilis part of our societi
there ar mani econom chang put in zossimov
how ar we to explain it razumihin caught him up it might be
explain by our inveter impract
how do you mean
what answer had your lectur in moscow to make to the question why he
wa forg note everybodi is get rich on wai or anoth so i
want to make hast to get rich too i dont rememb the exact word
but the upshot wa that he want monei for noth without wait or
work weve grown us to have everyth readymad to walk
on crutch to have our food chew for us then the great hour
struck and everi man show himself in hi true colour
the emancip of the serf in 1861 is meant

there have been a great mani of these crime late said zametov
onli the other dai i read in the moscow new that a whole gang of
fals coiner had been caught in moscow it wa a regular societi thei
us to forg ticket
oh but it wa a long time ago i read about it a month ago
raskolnikov answer calmli so you consid them crimin he ad
smile
of cours thei ar crimin
thei thei ar children simpleton not crimin why half a hundr
peopl meet for such an objectwhat an idea three would be too
mani and then thei want to have more faith in on anoth than in
themselv on ha onli to blab in hi cup and it all collaps
simpleton thei engag untrustworthi peopl to chang the noteswhat
a thing to trust to a casual stranger well let us suppos that these
simpleton succe and each make a million and what follow for the
rest of their live each is depend on the other for the rest of hi
life better hang oneself at onc and thei did not know how to chang
the note either the man who chang the note took five thousand
roubl and hi hand trembl he count the first four thousand
but did not count the fifth thousandh wa in such a hurri to get the
monei into hi pocket and run awai of cours he rous suspicion and
the whole thing came to a crash through on fool is it possibl
that hi hand trembl observ zametov ye that quit
possibl that i feel quit sure is possibl sometim on cant
stand thing
cant stand that
why could you stand it then no i couldnt for the sake of a hundr
roubl to face such a terribl experi to go with fals note
into a bank where it their busi to spot that sort of thing no i
should not have the face to do it would you
raskolnikov had an intens desir again to put hi tongu out shiver
kept run down hi spine
i should do it quit differ raskolnikov began thi is how i
would chang the note id count the first thousand three or four time
backward and forward look at everi note and then id set to the
second thousand id count that halfwai through and then hold some
fiftyroubl note to the light then turn it then hold it to the light
againto see whether it wa a good on i am afraid i would sai a
relat of mine lost twentyf roubl the other dai through a
fals note and then id tell them the whole stori and after i began
count the third no excus me i would sai i fanci i made a
mistak in the seventh hundr in that second thousand i am not sure
and so i would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and
so on to the end and when i had finish id pick out on from the
fifth and on from the second thousand and take them again to the light
and ask again chang them pleas and put the clerk into such a stew
that he would not know how to get rid of me when id finish and had
gone out id come back no excus me and ask for some explan
that how id do it
foo what terribl thing you sai said zametov laugh but all
that is onli talk i dare sai when it came to deed youd make a slip
i believ that even a practis desper man cannot alwai reckon on
himself much less you and i to take an exampl near homethat old
woman murder in our district the murder seem to have been a
desper fellow he risk everyth in open daylight wa save by
a miraclebut hi hand shook too he did not succe in rob the
place he couldnt stand it that wa clear from the
raskolnikov seem offend
clear why dont you catch him then he cri malici gibe at
zametov
well thei will catch him
who you do you suppos you could catch him youv a tough job a
great point for you is whether a man is spend monei or not if he had
no monei and suddenli begin spend he must be the man so that ani
child can mislead you
the fact is thei alwai do that though answer zametov a man will
commit a clever murder at the risk of hi life and then at onc he goe
drink in a tavern thei ar caught spend monei thei ar not all
as cun as you ar you wouldnt go to a tavern of cours
raskolnikov frown and look steadili at zametov
you seem to enjoi the subject and would like to know how i should
behav in that case too he ask with displeasur
i should like to zametov answer firmli and serious somewhat too
much earnest began to appear in hi word and look
veri much
veri much
all right then thi is how i should behav raskolnikov began again
bring hi face close to zametov again stare at him and speak
in a whisper so that the latter posit shudder thi is what
i should have done i should have taken the monei and jewel i should
have walk out of there and have gone straight to some desert place
with fenc round it and scarc anyon to be seen some kitchen garden
or place of that sort i should have look out beforehand some stone
weigh a hundredweight or more which had been ly in the corner from
the time the hous wa built i would lift that stonether would sure
to be a hollow under it and i would put the jewel and monei in that
hole then id roll the stone back so that it would look as befor
would press it down with my foot and walk awai and for a year or two
three mayb i would not touch it and well thei could search there
be no trace

whisper and move awai from raskolnikov whose ey were glitter he
had turn fearfulli pale and hi upper lip wa twitch and quiver
he bent down as close as possibl to zametov and hi lip began to move
without utter a word thi last for half a minut he knew what he
wa do but could not restrain himself the terribl word trembl on
hi lip like the latch on that door in anoth moment it will break
out in anoth moment he will let it go he will speak out
and what if it wa i who murder the old woman and lizaveta he said
suddenli andrealis what he had done
zametov look wildli at him and turn white as the tablecloth hi

avdotya romanovna said final and of cours there wa no go
beyond that for thi wa a point which pulcheria alexandrovna wa
afraid to discuss dounia went up and kiss her mother the latter
warmli embrac her without speak then she sat down to wait
anxious for razumihin return timidli watch her daughter who
walk up and down the room with her arm fold lost in thought
thi walk up and down when she wa think wa a habit of avdotya
romanovna and the mother wa alwai afraid to break in on her
daughter mood at such moment
razumihin of cours wa ridicul in hi sudden drunken infatu
for avdotya romanovna yet apart from hi eccentr condit mani
peopl would have thought it justifi if thei had seen avdotya
romanovna especi at that moment when she wa walk to and
fro with fold arm pensiv and melancholi avdotya romanovna wa
remark goodlook she wa tall strikingli wellproport
strong and selfreliantth latter qualiti wa appar in everi
gestur though it did not in the least detract from the grace and
soft of her movement in face she resembl her brother but she
might be describ as realli beauti her hair wa dark brown a
littl lighter than her brother there wa a proud light in her almost
black ey and yet at time a look of extraordinari kind she wa
pale but it wa a healthi pallor her face wa radiant with fresh
and vigour her mouth wa rather small the full red lower lip project
a littl as did her chin it wa the onli irregular in her beauti
face but it gave it a peculiarli individu and almost haughti
express her face wa alwai more seriou and thought than gai
but how well smile how well youth lightheart irrespons
laughter suit her face it wa natur enough that a warm open
simpleheart honest giant like razumihin who had never seen anyon
like her and wa not quit sober at the time should lose hi head
immedi besid as chanc would have it he saw dounia for the
first time transfigur by her love for her brother and her joi at
meet him afterward he saw her lower lip quiver with indign
at her brother insol cruel and ungrat wordsand hi fate wa
seal
he had spoken the truth moreov when he blurt out in hi drunken
talk on the stair that praskovya pavlovna raskolnikov eccentr
landladi would be jealou of pulcheria alexandrovna as well as of
avdotya romanovna on hi account although pulcheria alexandrovna wa
fortythre her face still retain trace of her former beauti she
look much younger than her ag inde which is almost alwai the
case with women who retain seren of spirit sensit and pure
sincer warmth of heart to old ag we mai add in parenthesi that to
preserv all thi is the onli mean of retain beauti to old ag her
hair had begun to grow grei and thin there had long been littl crow
foot wrinkl round her ey her cheek were hollow and sunken from
anxieti and grief and yet it wa a handsom face she wa dounia
over again twenti year older but without the project underlip
pulcheria alexandrovna wa emot but not sentiment timid and
yield but onli to a certain point she could give wai and accept a
great deal even of what wa contrari to her convict but there wa a
certain barrier fix by honesti principl and the deepest convict
which noth would induc her to cross
exactli twenti minut after razumihin departur there came two
subdu but hurri knock at the door he had come back

chapter ii
razumihin wake up next morn at eight oclock troubl and seriou
he found himself confront with mani new and unlookedfor perplex
he had never expect that he would ever wake up feel like that he
rememb everi detail of the previou dai and he knew that a perfectli
novel experi had befallen him that he had receiv an impress
unlik anyth he had known befor at the same time he recognis
clearli that the dream which had fire hi imagin wa hopelessli
unattainableso unattain that he felt posit asham of it and
he hasten to pass to the other more practic care and difficulti
bequeath him by that thrice accurs yesterdai
the most aw recollect of the previou dai wa the wai he had shown
himself base and mean not onli becaus he had been drunk but
becaus he had taken advantag of the young girl posit to abus
her fianc in hi stupid jealousi know noth of their mutual
relat and oblig and next to noth of the man himself and
what right had he to criticis him in that hasti and unguard manner
who had ask for hi opinion wa it thinkabl that such a creatur as
avdotya romanovna would be marri an unworthi man for monei so there
must be someth in him the lodg but after all how could he know
the charact of the lodg he wa furnish a flat foo how
despic it all wa and what justif wa it that he wa drunk
such a stupid excus wa even more degrad in wine is truth and the
truth had all come out that is all the unclean of hi coars
and enviou heart and would such a dream ever be permiss to
him razumihin what wa he besid such a girlh the drunken noisi
braggart of last night wa it possibl to imagin so absurd and cynic
a juxtaposit razumihin blush desper at the veri idea and
suddenli the recollect forc itself vividli upon him of how he had
said last night on the stair that the landladi would be jealou of
avdotya romanovna that wa simpli intoler he brought hi fist
down heavili on the kitchen stove hurt hi hand and sent on of the
brick fly
of cours he mutter to himself a minut later with a feel of
selfabas of cours all these infami can never be wipe out or
smooth over and so it useless even to think of it and i must
go to them in silenc and do my duti in silenc too and not ask
forgiv and sai noth for all is lost now
and yet as he dress he examin hi attir more carefulli than usual
he hadnt anoth suitif he had had perhap he wouldnt have put it
on i would have made a point of not put it on but in ani case he
could not remain a cynic and a dirti sloven he had no right to offend
the feel of other especi when thei were in need of hi
assist and ask him to see them he brush hi cloth carefulli
hi linen wa alwai decent in that respect he wa especi clean
he wash that morn scrupulouslyh got some soap from nastasyah
wash hi hair hi neck and especi hi hand when it came to the
question whether to shave hi stubbl chin or not praskovya pavlovna
had capit razor that had been left by her late husband the question
wa angrili answer in the neg let it stai as it is what if
thei think that i shave on purpos to thei certainli would think
so not on ani account
and the worst of it wa he wa so coars so dirti he had the
manner of a pothous and and even admit that he knew he had
some of the essenti of a gentleman what wa there in that to be
proud of everyon ought to be a gentleman and more than that and all
the same he rememb he too had done littl thing not exactli
dishonest and yet and what thought he sometim had hm and to
set all that besid avdotya romanovna confound it so be it well hed
make a point then of be dirti greasi pothous in hi manner and he
wouldnt care hed be wors
he wa engag in such monologu when zossimov who had spent the night
in praskovya pavlovna parlour came in
he wa go home and wa in a hurri to look at the invalid first
razumihin inform him that raskolnikov wa sleep like a dormous
zossimov gave order that thei shouldnt wake him and promis to see
him again about eleven
if he is still at home he ad damn it all if on cant control
on patient how is on to cure them do you know whether he will
go to them or whether thei ar come here

what wa said she wa wear a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a
white transpar scarf round her neck razumihin soon detect sign of
extrem poverti in their belong had avdotya romanovna been dress
like a queen he felt that he would not be afraid of her but perhap
just becaus she wa poorli dress and that he notic all the miseri
of her surround hi heart wa fill with dread and he began to be
afraid of everi word he utter everi gestur he made which wa veri
try for a man who alreadi felt diffid

restless in hi movement
he onli want a sling on hi arm or a bandag on hi finger to complet
the impress of a man with a pain abscess or a broken arm the
pale sombr face light up for a moment when hi mother and sister
enter but thi onli gave it a look of more intens suffer in
place of it listless deject the light soon di awai but the look
of suffer remain and zossimov watch and studi hi patient
with all the zest of a young doctor begin to practis notic
in him no joi at the arriv of hi mother and sister but a sort of
bitter hidden determin to bear anoth hour or two of inevit
tortur he saw later that almost everi word of the follow
convers seem to touch on some sore place and irrit it but
at the same time he marvel at the power of control himself
and hide hi feel in a patient who the previou dai had like a
monomaniac fallen into a frenzi at the slightest word
ye i see myself now that i am almost well said raskolnikov
give hi mother and sister a kiss of welcom which made pulcheria
alexandrovna radiant at onc and i dont sai thi as i did

am i make such a fuss for what is it all about marri whom you like
he said thi as though to himself but said it aloud and look for
some time at hi sister as though puzzl he open the letter at
last still with the same look of strang wonder on hi face then
slowli and attent he began read and read it through twice
pulcheria alexandrovna show mark anxieti and all inde expect
someth particular
what surpris me he began after a short paus hand the letter
to hi mother but not address anyon in particular is that he is a
busi man a lawyer and hi convers is pretenti inde and
yet he write such an uneduc letter
thei all start thei had expect someth quit differ
but thei all write like that you know razumihin observ abruptli
have you read it
ye
we show him rodya we consult him just now pulcheria
alexandrovna began embarrass
that just the jargon of the court razumihin put in legal
document ar written like that to thi dai
legal ye it just legalbusi languagenot so veri uneduc
and not quit educatedbusi languag
pyotr petrovitch make no secret of the fact that he had a cheap
educ he is proud inde of have made hi own wai avdotya
romanovna observ somewhat offend by her brother tone
well if he proud of it he ha reason i dont deni it you seem to
be offend sister at my make onli such a frivol critic on the
letter and to think that i speak of such trifl matter on purpos to
annoi you it is quit the contrari an observ apropo of the style
occur to me that is by no mean irrelev as thing stand there
is on express blame yourselv put in veri significantli and
plainli and there is besid a threat that he will go awai at onc if i
am present that threat to go awai is equival to a threat to abandon
you both if you ar disobedi and to abandon you now after summon
you to petersburg well what do you think can on resent such an
express from luzhin as we should if he he point to razumihin had
written it or zossimov or on of us
nno answer dounia with more anim i saw clearli that it
wa too nave express and that perhap he simpli ha no skill
in write that is a true critic brother i did not expect
inde

intend but i must disillus you a littl there is on express
in the letter on slander about me and rather a contempt on i
gave the monei last night to the widow a woman in consumpt crush
with troubl and not on the pretext of the funer but simpli to pai
for the funer and not to the daughtera young woman as he write
of notori behaviour whom i saw last night for the first time in my
lifebut to the widow in all thi i see a too hasti desir to slander
me and to rais dissens between us it is express again in legal
jargon that is to sai with a too obviou displai of the aim and
with a veri nave eager he is a man of intellig but to act
sensibl intellig is not enough it all show the man and i

off into space
onli fanci rodya what we got on to yesterdai whether there is such a
thing as crime i told you that we talk our head off
what is there strang it an everydai social question raskolnikov
answer casual
the question wasnt put quit like that observ porfiri
not quit that true razumihin agre at onc get warm and
hurri as usual listen rodion and tell us your opinion i want to
hear it i wa fight tooth and nail with them and want you to
help me i told them you were come it began with the socialist
doctrin you know their doctrin crime is a protest against the
abnorm of the social organis and noth more and noth
more no other caus admit
you ar wrong there cri porfiri petrovitch he wa notic
anim and kept laugh as he look at razumihin which made him
more excit than ever
noth is admit razumihin interrupt with heat
i am not wrong ill show you their pamphlet everyth with them
is the influenc of environ and noth els their favourit
phrase from which it follow that if societi is normal organis
all crime will ceas at onc sinc there will be noth to protest
against and all men will becom righteou in on instant human natur
is not taken into account it is exclud it not suppos to exist
thei dont recognis that human develop by a histor live
process will becom at last a normal societi but thei believ that a
social system that ha come out of some mathemat brain is go
to organis all human at onc and make it just and sinless in an
instant quicker than ani live process that why thei instinct
dislik histori noth but ugli and stupid in it and thei
explain it all as stupid that why thei so dislik the live
process of life thei dont want a live soul the live soul
demand life the soul wont obei the rule of mechan the soul is an
object of suspicion the soul is retrograd but what thei want though
it smell of death and can be made of indiarubb at least is not
aliv ha no will is servil and wont revolt and it come in the end
to their reduc everyth to the build of wall and the plan
of room and passag in a phalansteri the phalansteri is readi
inde but your human natur is not readi for the phalansteryit
want life it hasnt complet it vital process it too soon for the
graveyard you cant skip over natur by logic logic presuppos three
possibl but there ar million cut awai a million and reduc
it all to the question of comfort that the easiest solut of the
problem it seduct clear and you musnt think about it that
the great thing you mustnt think the whole secret of life in two
page of print
now he is off beat the drum catch hold of him do laugh
porfiri can you imagin he turn to raskolnikov six peopl
hold forth like that last night in on room with punch as a
preliminari no brother you ar wrong environ account for a
great deal in crime i can assur you of that
oh i know it doe but just tell me a man of forti violat a child
of ten wa it environ drove him to it
well strictli speak it did porfiri observ with noteworthi
graviti a crime of that natur mai be veri well ascrib to the
influenc of environ
razumihin wa almost in a frenzi oh if you like he roar ill
prove to you that your white eyelash mai veri well be ascrib to the
church of ivan the great be two hundr and fifti feet high and i
will prove it clearli exactli progress and even with a liber
tendenc i undertak to will you bet on it
done let hear pleas how he will prove it
he is alwai humbug confound him cri razumihin jump up and
gesticul what the us of talk to you he doe all that
on purpos you dont know him rodion he took their side yesterdai
simpli to make fool of them and the thing he said yesterdai and thei
were delight he can keep it up for a fortnight togeth last year he
persuad us that he wa go into a monasteri he stuck to it for two
month not long ago he took it into hi head to declar he wa go
to get marri that he had everyth readi for the wed he order
new cloth inde we all began to congratul him there wa no
bride noth all pure fantasi
ah you ar wrong i got the cloth befor it wa the new cloth in
fact that made me think of take you in
ar you such a good dissembl raskolnikov ask carelessli
you wouldnt have suppos it eh wait a bit i shall take you in
too hahaha no ill tell you the truth all these question about
crime environ children recal to my mind an articl of your
which interest me at the time on crime or someth of the
sort i forget the titl i read it with pleasur two month ago in the
period review
my articl in the period review raskolnikov ask in
astonish i certainli did write an articl upon a book six month
ago when i left the univers but i sent it to the weekli review
but it came out in the period
and the weekli review ceas to exist so that why it wasnt
print at the time
that true but when it ceas to exist the weekli review wa
amalgam with the period and so your articl appear two
month ago in the latter didnt you know
raskolnikov had not known
why you might get some monei out of them for the articl what a
strang person you ar you lead such a solitari life that you know
noth of matter that concern you directli it a fact i assur
you
bravo rodya i knew noth about it either cri razumihin ill
run todai to the readingroom and ask for the number two month ago
what wa the date it doesnt matter though i will find it think of
not tell us
how did you find out that the articl wa mine it onli sign with
an initi
i onli learnt it by chanc the other dai through the editor i know
him i wa veri much interest
i analys if i rememb the psycholog of a crimin befor and
after the crime
ye and you maintain that the perpetr of a crime is alwai
accompani by ill veri veri origin but it wa not that part
of your articl that interest me so much but an idea at the end of
the articl which i regret to sai you mere suggest without work
it out clearli there is if you recollect a suggest that there ar
certain person who can that is not precis ar abl to but have
a perfect right to commit breach of moral and crime and that the
law is not for them
raskolnikov smile at the exagger and intent distort of hi
idea
what what do you mean a right to crime but not becaus of the
influenc of environ razumihin inquir with some alarm even
no not exactli becaus of it answer porfiri in hi articl all
men ar divid into ordinari and extraordinari ordinari men have
to live in submiss have no right to transgress the law becaus
dont you see thei ar ordinari but extraordinari men have a right to
commit ani crime and to transgress the law in ani wai just becaus thei
ar extraordinari that wa your idea if i am not mistaken
what do you mean that cant be right razumihin mutter in
bewilder
raskolnikov smile again he saw the point at onc and knew where thei
want to drive him he decid to take up the challeng
that wasnt quit my content he began simpli and modestli yet
i admit that you have state it almost correctli perhap if you like
perfectli so it almost gave him pleasur to admit thi the onli
differ is that i dont contend that extraordinari peopl ar alwai
bound to commit breach of moral as you call it in fact i doubt
whether such an argument could be publish i simpli hint that an
extraordinari man ha the right that is not an offici right but
an inner right to decid in hi own conscienc to overstep certain
obstacl and onli in case it is essenti for the practic fulfil
of hi idea sometim perhap of benefit to the whole of human
you sai that my articl isnt definit i am readi to make it as clear
as i can perhap i am right in think you want me to veri well i
maintain that if the discoveri of kepler and newton could not have
been made known except by sacrif the live of on a dozen a
hundr or more men newton would have had the right would inde have
been in dutybound to elimin the dozen or the hundr men for
the sake of make hi discoveri known to the whole of human but
it doe not follow from that that newton had a right to murder peopl
right and left and to steal everi dai in the market then i rememb i
maintain in my articl that all well legisl and leader of men
such as lycurgu solon mahomet napoleon and so on were all without
except crimin from the veri fact that make a new law thei
transgress the ancient on hand down from their ancestor and held
sacr by the peopl and thei did not stop short at bloodsh either
if that bloodshedoften of innoc person fight brave in defenc
of ancient lawwer of us to their caus it remark in fact
that the major inde of these benefactor and leader of human
were guilti of terribl carnag in short i maintain that all great men
or even men a littl out of the common that is to sai capabl of give
some new word must from their veri natur be criminalsmor or less
of cours otherwis it hard for them to get out of the common rut
and to remain in the common rut is what thei cant submit to from their
veri natur again and to my mind thei ought not inde to submit to
it you see that there is noth particularli new in all that the
same thing ha been print and read a thousand time befor as for my
divis of peopl into ordinari and extraordinari i acknowledg that
it somewhat arbitrari but i dont insist upon exact number i onli
believ in my lead idea that men ar in gener divid by a law
of natur into two categori inferior ordinari that is so to sai
materi that serv onli to reproduc it kind and men who have
the gift or the talent to utter a new word there ar of cours
innumer subdivis but the distinguish featur of both
categori ar fairli well mark the first categori gener
speak ar men conserv in tempera and lawabid thei live
under control and love to be control to my think it is their duti
to be control becaus that their vocat and there is noth
humili in it for them the second categori all transgress the
law thei ar destroy or dispos to destruct accord to their
capac the crime of these men ar of cours rel and vari
for the most part thei seek in veri vari wai the destruct of the
present for the sake of the better but if such a on is forc for the
sake of hi idea to step over a corps or wade through blood he can i
maintain find within himself in hi conscienc a sanction for wade
through bloodthat depend on the idea and it dimens note that
it onli in that sens i speak of their right to crime in my articl
you rememb it began with the legal question there no need for
such anxieti howev the mass will scarc ever admit thi right
thei punish them or hang them more or less and in do so fulfil
quit justli their conserv vocat but the same mass set these
crimin on a pedest in the next gener and worship them more or
less the first categori is alwai the man of the present the second
the man of the futur the first preserv the world and peopl it the
second move the world and lead it to it goal each class ha an equal
right to exist in fact all have equal right with meand vive la
guerr ternelletil the new jerusalem of cours
then you believ in the new jerusalem do you
i do raskolnikov answer firmli as he said these word and dure
the whole preced tirad he kept hi ey on on spot on the carpet
and and do you believ in god excus my curios
i do repeat raskolnikov rais hi ey to porfiri
and do you believ in lazaru rise from the dead
i i do why do you ask all thi
you believ it liter
liter
you dont sai so i ask from curios excus me but let us
go back to the question thei ar not alwai execut some on the
contrari
triumph in their lifetim oh ye some attain their end in thi
life and then
thei begin execut other peopl
if it necessari inde for the most part thei do your remark is
veri witti
thank you but tell me thi how do you distinguish those extraordinari
peopl from the ordinari on ar there sign at their birth i feel
there ought to be more exactitud more extern definit excus the
natur anxieti of a practic lawabid citizen but couldnt thei
adopt a special uniform for instanc couldnt thei wear someth be
brand in some wai for you know if confus aris and a member of
on categori imagin that he belong to the other begin to elimin
obstacl as you so happili express it then
oh that veri often happen that remark is wittier than the other
thank you
no reason to but take note that the mistak can onli aris in
the first categori that is among the ordinari peopl as i perhap
unfortun call them in spite of their predisposit to
obedi veri mani of them through a play of natur sometim
vouchsaf even to the cow like to imagin themselv advanc peopl
destroy and to push themselv into the new movement and
thi quit sincer meanwhil the realli new peopl ar veri often
unobserv by them or even despis as reactionari of grovel
tendenc but i dont think there is ani consider danger here
and you realli need not be uneasi for thei never go veri far of cours
thei might have a thrash sometim for let their fanci run awai
with them and to teach them their place but no more in fact even
thi isnt necessari as thei castig themselv for thei ar veri
conscienti some perform thi servic for on anoth and other
chastis themselv with their own hand thei will impos variou
public act of penit upon themselv with a beauti and edifi
effect in fact youv noth to be uneasi about it a law of
natur
well you have certainli set my mind more at rest on that score but
there anoth thing worri me tell me pleas ar there mani peopl
who have the right to kill other these extraordinari peopl i am
readi to bow down to them of cours but you must admit it alarm
if there ar a great mani of them eh
oh you neednt worri about that either raskolnikov went on in the
same tone peopl with new idea peopl with the faintest capac for
sai someth new ar extrem few in number extraordinarili
so in fact on thing onli is clear that the appear of all these
grade and subdivis of men must follow with unfail regular
some law of natur that law of cours is unknown at present but i am
convinc that it exist and on dai mai becom known the vast mass of
mankind is mere materi and onli exist in order by some great effort
by some mysteri process by mean of some cross of race and
stock to bring into the world at last perhap on man out of a
thousand with a spark of independ on in ten thousand perhapsi
speak roughli approximatelyi born with some independ and with
still greater independ on in a hundr thousand the man of geniu
is on of million and the great genius the crown of human
appear on earth perhap on in mani thousand million in fact i have
not peep into the retort in which all thi take place but there
certainli is and must be a definit law it cannot be a matter of
chanc
why ar you both joke razumihin cri at last there you sit
make fun of on anoth ar you seriou rodya
raskolnikov rais hi pale and almost mourn face and made no repli
and the unconc persist nervou and discourt sarcasm of
porfiri seem strang to razumihin besid that quiet and mourn face
well brother if you ar realli seriou you ar right of cours
in sai that it not new that it like what weve read and heard a
thousand time alreadi but what is realli origin in all thi and is
exclus your own to my horror is that you sanction bloodsh
in the name of conscienc and excus my sai so with such
fanatic that i take it is the point of your articl but that
sanction of bloodsh by conscienc is to my mind more terribl
than the offici legal sanction of bloodsh
you ar quit right it is more terribl porfiri agre
ye you must have exagger there is some mistak i shall read it
you cant think that i shall read it
all that is not in the articl there onli a hint of it said
raskolnikov
ye ye porfiri couldnt sit still your attitud to crime is
pretti clear to me now but excus me for my impertin i am
realli asham to be worri you like thi you see youv remov
my anxieti as to the two grade get mix but there ar variou
practic possibl that make me uneasi what if some man or youth
imagin that he is a lycurgu or mahometa futur on of courseand
suppos he begin to remov all obstacl he ha some great
enterpris befor him and need monei for it and tri to get it
do you see
zametov gave a sudden guffaw in hi corner raskolnikov did not even
rais hi ey to him
i must admit he went on calmli that such case certainli must
aris the vain and foolish ar particularli apt to fall into that
snare young peopl especi
ye you see well then
what then raskolnikov smile in repli that not my fault so it is
and so it alwai will be he said just now he nod at razumihin
that i sanction bloodsh societi is too well protect by prison
banish crimin investig penal servitud there no need to
be uneasi you have but to catch the thief
and what if we do catch him
then he get what he deserv
you ar certainli logic but what of hi conscienc
why do you care about that
simpli from human
if he ha a conscienc he will suffer for hi mistak that will be hi
punishmenta well as the prison
but the real genius ask razumihin frown those who have
the right to murder oughtnt thei to suffer at all even for the blood
theyv shed
why the word ought it not a matter of permiss or prohibit
he will suffer if he is sorri for hi victim pain and suffer ar
alwai inevit for a larg intellig and a deep heart the
realli great men must i think have great sad on earth he ad
dreamili not in the tone of the convers
he rais hi ey look earnestli at them all smile and took hi
cap he wa too quiet by comparison with hi manner at hi entranc and
he felt thi everyon got up
well you mai abus me be angri with me if you like porfiri
petrovitch began again but i cant resist allow me on littl
question i know i am troubl you there is just on littl notion i
want to express simpli that i mai not forget it
veri good tell me your littl notion raskolnikov stood wait pale
and grave befor him

articl sure you couldnt have help hehe fanci yourself
just a littl an extraordinari man utter a new word in your
sens that so isnt it
quit possibl raskolnikov answer contemptu
razumihin made a movement
and if so could you bring yourself in case of worldli difficulti
and hardship or for some servic to humanityto overstep obstacl
for instanc to rob and murder
and again he wink with hi left ey and laugh noiselessli just as
befor
if i did i certainli should not tell you raskolnikov answer with
defiant and haughti contempt
no i wa onli interest on account of your articl from a literari
point of view
foo how obviou and insol that is raskolnikov thought with
repuls
allow me to observ he answer dryli that i dont consid myself
a mahomet or a napoleon nor ani personag of that kind and not be
on of them i cannot tell you how i should act
oh come dont we all think ourselv napoleon now in russia
porfiri petrovitch said with alarm familiar
someth peculiar betrai itself in the veri inton of hi voic
perhap it wa on of these futur napoleon who did for alyona
ivanovna last week zametov blurt out from the corner
raskolnikov did not speak but look firmli and intent at porfiri
razumihin wa scowl gloomili he seem befor thi to be notic
someth he look angrili around there wa a minut of gloomi
silenc raskolnikov turn to go

excess polit veri veri glad of your acquaint as for your
request have no uneasi write just as i told you or better still

a talk as on of the last to be there you might perhap be abl to
tell us someth he ad with a most goodnatur express

sharpli
oh why that not necessari for the present you misunderstand me
i lose no opportun you see and iv talk with all who had
pledg i obtain evid from some of them and you ar the
last ye by the wai he cri seemingli suddenli delight i
just rememb what wa i think of he turn to razumihin you
were talk my ear off about that nikolai of cours i know i know
veri well he turn to raskolnikov that the fellow is innoc but
what is on to do we had to troubl dmitri too thi is the point
thi is all when you went up the stair it wa past seven wasnt it
ye answer raskolnikov with an unpleas sensat at the veri
moment he spoke that he need not have said it
then when you went upstair between seven and eight didnt you see in
a flat that stood open on a second storei do you rememb two workmen
or at least on of them thei were paint there didnt you notic
them it veri veri import for them
painter no i didnt see them raskolnikov answer slowli as
though ransack hi memori while at the same instant he wa rack
everi nerv almost swoon with anxieti to conjectur as quickli as
possibl where the trap lai and not to overlook anyth no i didnt
see them and i dont think i notic a flat like that open but on
the fourth storei he had master the trap now and wa triumphant
i rememb now that someon wa move out of the flat opposit alyona
ivanovna i rememb i rememb it clearli some porter
were carri out a sofa and thei squeez me against the wall but
painter no i dont rememb that there were ani painter and i
dont think that there wa a flat open anywher no there wasnt
what do you mean razumihin shout suddenli as though he had
reflect and realis why it wa on the dai of the murder the
painter were at work and he wa there three dai befor what ar you
ask
foo i have muddl it porfiri slap himself on the forehead
deuc take it thi busi is turn my brain he address
raskolnikov somewhat apologet it would be such a great thing for
us to find out whether anyon had seen them between seven and eight at
the flat so i fanci you could perhap have told us someth i
quit muddl it
then you should be more care razumihin observ grimli
the last word were utter in the passag porfiri petrovitch saw them
to the door with excess polit
thei went out into the street gloomi and sullen and for some step thei
did not sai a word raskolnikov drew a deep breath
chapter vi
i dont believ it i cant believ it repeat razumihin try in
perplex to refut raskolnikov argument
thei were by now approach bakaleyev lodg where pulcheria
alexandrovna and dounia had been expect them a long while razumihin
kept stop on the wai in the heat of discuss confus and excit
by the veri fact that thei were for the first time speak openli about
it
dont believ it then answer raskolnikov with a cold careless
smile you were notic noth as usual but i wa weigh everi
word
you ar suspici that is why you weigh their word hm
certainli i agre porfiri tone wa rather strang and still
more that wretch zametov you ar right there wa someth about
himbut why why
he ha chang hi mind sinc last night
quit the contrari if thei had that brainless idea thei would do
their utmost to hide it and conceal their card so as to catch you
afterward but it wa all impud and careless
if thei had had factsi mean real factsor at least ground for
suspicion then thei would certainli have tri to hide their game
in the hope of get more thei would have made a search long ago
besid but thei have no fact not on it is all mirageal
ambigu simpli a float idea so thei try to throw me out by
impud and perhap he wa irrit at have no fact and blurt
it out in hi vexationor perhap he ha some plan he seem an
intellig man perhap he want to frighten me by pretend to
know thei have a psycholog of their own brother but it is loathsom
explain it all stop
and it insult insult i understand you but sinc we have
spoken openli now and it is an excel thing that we have at lasti
am glad i will own now frankli that i notic it in them long ago
thi idea of cours the merest hint onlyan insinuationbut why an
insinu even how dare thei what foundat have thei if onli you
knew how furiou i have been think onli simpli becaus a poor student
unhing by poverti and hypochondria on the ev of a sever deliri
ill note that suspici vain proud who ha not seen a soul to
speak to for six month in rag and in boot without sole ha to
face some wretch policemen and put up with their insol and
the unexpect debt thrust under hi nose the iou present
by tchebarov the new paint thirti degre reaumur and a stifl
atmospher a crowd of peopl the talk about the murder of a person
where he had been just befor and all that on an empti stomachh
might well have a faint fit and that that is what thei found it
all on damn them i understand how annoi it is but in your place
rodya i would laugh at them or better still spit in their ugli face
and spit a dozen time in all direct id hit out in all
direct neatli too and so id put an end to it damn them dont be
downheart it a shame
he realli ha put it well though raskolnikov thought
damn them but the crossexamin again tomorrow he said with
bitter must i realli enter into explan with them i feel
vex as it is that i condescend to speak to zametov yesterdai in the
restaur
damn it i will go myself to porfiri i will squeez it out of him as
on of the famili he must let me know the in and out of it all and
as for zametov
at last he see through him thought raskolnikov
stai cri razumihin seiz him by the shoulder again stai you
were wrong i have thought it out you ar wrong how wa that a trap
you sai that the question about the workmen wa a trap but if you had
done that could you have said you had seen them paint the flat
and the workmen on the contrari you would have seen noth even if
you had seen it who would own it against himself
if i had done that thing i should certainli have said that i had
seen the workmen and the flat raskolnikov answer with reluct
and obviou disgust
but why speak against yourself
becaus onli peasant or the most inexperienc novic deni
everyth flatli at examin if a man is ever so littl develop
and experienc he will certainli try to admit all the extern fact
that cant be avoid but will seek other explan of them will
introduc some special unexpect turn that will give them anoth
signific and put them in anoth light porfiri might well reckon
that i should be sure to answer so and sai i had seen them to give an
air of truth and then make some explan
but he would have told you at onc that the workmen could not have been
there two dai befor and that therefor you must have been there on
the dai of the murder at eight oclock and so he would have caught you
over a detail
ye that is what he wa reckon on that i should not have time to
reflect and should be in a hurri to make the most like answer and
so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two dai
befor
but how could you forget it
noth easier it is in just such stupid thing clever peopl ar most
easili caught the more cun a man is the less he suspect that he
will be caught in a simpl thing the more cun a man is the simpler
the trap he must be caught in porfiri is not such a fool as you
think
he is a knave then if that is so
raskolnikov could not help laugh but at the veri moment he wa
struck by the strang of hi own frank and the eager
with which he had made thi explan though he had kept up all the
preced convers with gloomi repuls obvious with a motiv
from necess
i am get a relish for certain aspect he thought to himself
but almost at the same instant he becam suddenli uneasi as though an
unexpect and alarm idea had occur to him hi uneasi kept on
increas thei had just reach the entranc to bakaleyev
go in alon said raskolnikov suddenli i will be back directli
where ar you go why we ar just here
i cant help it i will come in half an hour tell them
sai what you like i will come with you
you too want to tortur me he scream with such bitter
irrit such despair in hi ey that razumihin hand drop
he stood for some time on the step look gloomili at raskolnikov
stride rapidli awai in the direct of hi lodg at last grit
hi teeth and clench hi fist he swore he would squeez porfiri
like a lemon that veri dai and went up the stair to reassur pulcheria
alexandrovna who wa by now alarm at their long absenc
when raskolnikov got home hi hair wa soak with sweat and he wa
breath heavili he went rapidli up the stair walk into hi
unlock room and at onc fasten the latch then in senseless terror
he rush to the corner to that hole under the paper where he had put
the thing put hi hand in and for some minut felt carefulli in the
hole in everi crack and fold of the paper find noth he got up
and drew a deep breath as he wa reach the step of bakaleyev he
suddenli fanci that someth a chain a stud or even a bit of paper
in which thei had been wrap with the old woman handwrit on it
might somehow have slip out and been lost in some crack and then
might suddenli turn up as unexpect conclus evid against him
he stood as though lost in thought and a strang humili half
senseless smile strai on hi lip he took hi cap at last and went
quietli out of the room hi idea were all tangl he went dreamili
through the gatewai
here he is himself shout a loud voic
he rais hi head
the porter wa stand at the door of hi littl room and wa point
him out to a short man who look like an artisan wear a long coat
and a waistcoat and look at a distanc remark like a woman he
stoop and hi head in a greasi cap hung forward from hi wrinkl
flabbi face he look over fifti hi littl ey were lost in fat and
thei look out grimli sternli and discontentedli
what is it raskolnikov ask go up to the porter
the man stole a look at him from under hi brow and he look at him
attent deliber then he turn slowli and went out of the
gate into the street without sai a word
what is it cri raskolnikov
why he there wa ask whether a student live here mention your
name and whom you lodg with i saw you come and point you out and
he went awai it funni
the porter too seem rather puzzl but not much so and after
wonder for a moment he turn and went back to hi room
raskolnikov ran after the stranger and at onc caught sight of
him walk along the other side of the street with the same even
deliber step with hi ey fix on the ground as though in
medit he soon overtook him but for some time walk behind him
at last move on to a level with him he look at hi face the man
notic him at onc look at him quickli but drop hi ey again
and so thei walk for a minut side by side without utter a word
you were inquir for me of the porter raskolnikov said at last
but in a curious quiet voic
the man made no answer he didnt even look at him again thei were both
silent
why do you come and ask for me and sai noth what the
mean of it
raskolnikov voic broke and he seem unabl to articul the word
clearli
the man rais hi ey thi time and turn a gloomi sinist look at
raskolnikov
murder he said suddenli in a quiet but clear and distinct voic
raskolnikov went on walk besid him hi leg felt suddenli weak a
cold shiver ran down hi spine and hi heart seem to stand still for
a moment then suddenli began throb as though it were set free so
thei walk for about a hundr pace side by side in silenc
the man did not look at him
what do you mean what is who is a murder mutter
raskolnikov hardli audibl
you ar a murder the man answer still more articul and
emphat with a smile of triumphant hatr and again he look
straight into raskolnikov pale face and stricken ey
thei had just reach the crossroad the man turn to the left
without look behind him raskolnikov remain stand gaze after
him he saw him turn round fifti pace awai and look back at him still
stand there raskolnikov could not see clearli but he fanci that
he wa again smile the same smile of cold hatr and triumph
with slow falter step with shake knee raskolnikov made hi wai
back to hi littl garret feel chill all over he took off hi cap
and put it on the tabl and for ten minut he stood without move
then he sank exhaust on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he
stretch himself on it so he lai for half an hour
he thought of noth some thought or fragment of thought some
imag without order or coher float befor hi mindfac of
peopl he had seen in hi childhood or met somewher onc whom he would
never have recal the belfri of the church at v the billiard tabl
in a restaur and some offic plai billiard the smell of cigar

dark all sloppi with dirti water and strewn with eggshel and the
sundai bell float in from somewher the imag follow on
anoth whirl like a hurrican some of them he like and tri
to clutch at but thei fade and all the while there wa an oppress
within him but it wa not overwhelm sometim it wa even
pleasant the slight shiver still persist but that too
wa an almost pleasant sensat
he heard the hurri footstep of razumihin he close hi ey and
pretend to be asleep razumihin open the door and stood for some
time in the doorwai as though hesit then he step softli into
the room and went cautious to the sofa raskolnikov heard nastasya
whisper

quit so answer razumihin both withdrew carefulli and close the
door anoth halfhour pass raskolnikov open hi ey turn on
hi back again clasp hi hand behind hi head

and from where did he see why ha he onli now sprung out of the earth
and how could he see is it possibl hm continu raskolnikov
turn cold and shiver and the jewel case nikolai found behind the
doorwa that possibl a clue you miss an infinitesim line and you
can build it into a pyramid of evid a fly flew by and saw it is it

had becom i ought to have known it he thought with a bitter smile
and how dare i know myself know how i should be take up an
ax and shed blood i ought to have known beforehand ah but i did
know he whisper in despair at time he came to a standstil at some
thought

and felt that there wa someon hide behind it he cautious move
the cloak and saw sit on a chair in the corner the old woman bent
doubl so that he couldnt see her face but it wa she he stood over

bent her head lower he bent right down to the ground and peep up

with my infam proposalsi that it i am anticip you but
youv onli to assum that i too am a man et nihil humanum in a
word that i am capabl of be attract and fall in love which
doe not depend on our will then everyth can be explain in the
most natur manner the question is am i a monster or am i myself
a victim and what if i am a victim in propos to the object of my
passion to elop with me to america or switzerland i mai have cherish
the deepest respect for her and mai have thought that i wa promot
our mutual happi reason is the slave of passion you know why
probabl i wa do more harm to myself than anyon

want to have anyth to do with you we show you the door go out
svidrigalov broke into a sudden laugh

at my so to sai warmth the stori of your sister had been wrung out to
the last drop for the last three dai marfa petrovna had been forc to
sit at home she had noth to show herself with in the town besid
she had bore them so with that letter you heard about her read the
letter and all of a sudden those two switch fell from heaven her
first act wa to order the carriag to be got out not to speak
of the fact that there ar case when women ar veri veri glad to be
insult in spite of all their show of indign there ar instanc
of it with everyon human be in gener inde greatli love to
be insult have you notic that but it particularli so with women
on might even sai it their onli amus

besid the bell rang i wa sit todai feel veri heavi after a

marfa petrovna again she came in veri smart in a new green silk dress
with a long train good dai arkadi ivanovitch how do you like my
dress aniska cant make like thi aniska wa a dressmak in the
countri on of our former serf girl who had been train in moscow a

i said i want to get marri marfa petrovna that just like you
arkadi ivanovitch it doe you veri littl credit to come look for a
bride when youv hardli buri your wife and if you could make a good
choic at least but i know it wont be for your happi or her you
will onli be a laughingstock to all good peopl then she went out and
her train seem to rustl isnt it nonsens eh
but perhap you ar tell li raskolnikov put in
i rare lie answer svidrigalov thoughtfulli appar not
notic the rude of the question
and in the past have you ever seen ghost befor
yye i have seen them but onli onc in my life six year ago i had
a serf filka just after hi burial i call out forget filka my
pipe he came in and went to the cupboard where my pipe were i sat
still and thought he is do it out of reveng becaus we had a
violent quarrel just befor hi death how dare you come in with a hole
in your elbow i said go awai you scamp he turn and went out
and never came again i didnt tell marfa petrovna at the time i want
to have a servic sung for him but i wa asham
you should go to a doctor
i know i am not well without your tell me though i dont know
what wrong i believ i am five time as strong as you ar i didnt
ask you whether you believ that ghost ar seen but whether you
believ that thei exist
no i wont believ it raskolnikov cri with posit anger
what do peopl gener sai mutter svidrigalov as though
speak to himself look asid and bow hi head thei sai you
ar ill so what appear to you is onli unreal fantasi but that not
strictli logic i agre that ghost onli appear to the sick but that
onli prove that thei ar unabl to appear except to the sick not that
thei dont exist
noth of the sort raskolnikov insist irrit
no you dont think so svidrigalov went on look at him
deliber but what do you sai to thi argument help me with
it ghost ar as it were shred and fragment of other world the
begin of them a man in health ha of cours no reason to see
them becaus he is abov all a man of thi earth and is bound for the
sake of complet and order to live onli in thi life but as soon
as on is ill as soon as the normal earthli order of the organ is
broken on begin to realis the possibl of anoth world and the
more serious ill on is the closer becom on contact with that
other world so that as soon as the man di he step straight into that
world i thought of that long ago if you believ in a futur life you
could believ in that too
i dont believ in a futur life said raskolnikov
svidrigalov sat lost in thought
and what if there ar onli spider there or someth of that sort
he said suddenli
he is a madman thought raskolnikov
we alwai imagin etern as someth beyond our concept
someth vast vast but why must it be vast instead of all that what
if it on littl room like a bath hous in the countri black
and grimi and spider in everi corner and that all etern is i
sometim fanci it like that
can it be you can imagin noth juster and more comfort than
that raskolnikov cri with a feel of anguish
juster and how can we tell perhap that is just and do you know
it what i would certainli have made it answer svidrigalov with a
vagu smile
thi horribl answer sent a cold chill through raskolnikov svidrigalov
rais hi head look at him and suddenli began laugh
onli think he cri half an hour ago we had never seen each other
we regard each other as enemi there is a matter unsettl between
us weve thrown it asid and awai weve gone into the abstract wasnt
i right in sai that we were bird of a feather
kindli allow me raskolnikov went on irrit to ask you to explain
why you have honour me with your visit and and i am in a hurri
i have no time to wast i want to go out
by all mean by all mean your sister avdotya romanovna is go to
be marri to mr luzhin pyotr petrovitch
can you refrain from ani question about my sister and from mention
her name i cant understand how you dare utter her name in my presenc
if you realli ar svidrigalov
why but iv come here to speak about her how can i avoid mention
her
veri good speak but make hast
i am sure that you must have form your own opinion of thi mr
luzhin who is a connect of mine through my wife if you have onli
seen him for half an hour or heard ani fact about him he is no
match for avdotya romanovna i believ avdotya romanovna is sacrif
herself gener and imprud for the sake of for the sake of
her famili i fanci from all i had heard of you that you would be veri
glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrific of worldli
advantag now i know you person i am convinc of it
all thi is veri nave excus me i should have said impud on
your part said raskolnikov
you mean to sai that i am seek my own end dont be uneasi rodion
romanovitch if i were work for my own advantag i would not have
spoken out so directli i am not quit a fool i will confess someth
psycholog curiou about that just now defend my love for
avdotya romanovna i said i wa myself the victim well let me tell you
that iv no feel of love now not the slightest so that i wonder
myself inde for i realli did feel someth
through idl and deprav raskolnikov put in
i certainli am idl and deprav but your sister ha such qualiti
that even i could not help be impress by them but that all
nonsens as i see myself now
have you seen that long
i began to be awar of it befor but wa onli perfectli sure of it the
dai befor yesterdai almost at the moment i arriv in petersburg i
still fanci in moscow though that i wa come to try to get avdotya
romanovna hand and to cut out mr luzhin
excus me for interrupt you kindli be brief and come to the object
of your visit i am in a hurri i want to go out
with the greatest pleasur on arriv here and determin on a
certain journei i should like to make some necessari preliminari
arrang i left my children with an aunt thei ar well provid
for and thei have no need of me person and a nice father i should
make too i have taken noth but what marfa petrovna gave me a year
ago that enough for me excus me i am just come to the point
befor the journei which mai come off i want to settl mr luzhin too
it not that i detest him so much but it wa through him i quarrel
with marfa petrovna when i learn that she had dish up thi marriag
i want now to see avdotya romanovna through your mediat and if you
like in your presenc to explain to her that in the first place she
will never gain anyth but harm from mr luzhin then beg
her pardon for all past unpleas to make her a present of ten
thousand roubl and so assist the ruptur with mr luzhin a ruptur to
which i believ she is herself not disinclin if she could see the wai
to it
you ar certainli mad cri raskolnikov not so much anger as
astonish how dare you talk like that
i knew you would scream at me but in the first place though i am not
rich thi ten thousand roubl is perfectli free i have absolut no
need for it if avdotya romanovna doe not accept it i shall wast
it in some more foolish wai that the first thing secondli my
conscienc is perfectli easi i make the offer with no ulterior motiv
you mai not believ it but in the end avdotya romanovna and you will
know the point is that i did actual caus your sister whom i
greatli respect some troubl and unpleas and so sincer
regret it i wantnot to compens not to repai her for the
unpleas but simpli to do someth to her advantag to show
that i am not after all privileg to do noth but harm if there
were a millionth fraction of selfinterest in my offer i should not
have made it so openli and i should not have offer her ten thousand
onli when five week ago i offer her more besid i mai perhap
veri soon marri a young ladi and that alon ought to prevent suspicion
of ani design on avdotya romanovna in conclus let me sai that
in marri mr luzhin she is take monei just the same onli from
anoth man dont be angri rodion romanovitch think it over coolli
and quietli
svidrigalov himself wa exceedingli cool and quiet as he wa sai
thi
i beg you to sai no more said raskolnikov in ani case thi is
unpardon impertin
not in the least then a man mai do noth but harm to hi neighbour
in thi world and is prevent from do the tiniest bit of good
by trivial convent formal that absurd if i di for
instanc and left that sum to your sister in my will sure she
wouldnt refus it
veri like she would
oh no inde howev if you refus it so be it though ten
thousand roubl is a capit thing to have on occas in ani case i
beg you to repeat what i have said to avdotya romanovna
no i wont
in that case rodion romanovitch i shall be oblig to try and see her
myself and worri her by do so
and if i do tell her will you not try to see her
i dont know realli what to sai i should like veri much to see her
onc more
dont hope for it

he thought to himself strang to sai till that moment it had never
occur to him to wonder what razumihin would think when he knew as he
thought it raskolnikov look at him razumihin account of hi visit
to porfiri had veri littl interest for him so much had come and gone
sinc then
in the corridor thei came upon luzhin he had arriv punctual

cambric handkerchief reek of scent and blew hi nose with an air of
a benevol man who felt himself slight and wa firmli resolv to
insist on an explan in the passag the idea had occur to him to
keep on hi overcoat and walk awai and so give the two ladi a sharp
and emphat lesson and make them feel the graviti of the posit
but he could not bring himself to do thi besid he could not endur
uncertainti and he want an explan if hi request had been so
openli disobei there wa someth behind it and in that case it wa
better to find it out beforehand it rest with him to punish them and
there would alwai be time for that

pulcheria alexandrovna
i imagin that neither you nor avdotya romanovna have ani ground for
uneasi unless of cours you ar yourselv desir of get
into commun with him for my part i am on my guard and am now
discov where he is lodg
oh pyotr petrovitch you would not believ what a fright you have
given me pulcheria alexandrovna went on iv onli seen him twice
but i thought him terribl terribl i am convinc that he wa the
caus of marfa petrovna death
it imposs to be certain about that i have precis inform i
do not disput that he mai have contribut to acceler the cours of
event by the moral influenc so to sai of the affront but as to the
gener conduct and moral characterist of that personag i am
in agreement with you i do not know whether he is well off now and
precis what marfa petrovna left him thi will be known to me within
a veri short period but no doubt here in petersburg if he ha ani
pecuniari resourc he will relaps at onc into hi old wai he is
the most deprav and abjectli viciou specimen of that class of men
i have consider reason to believ that marfa petrovna who wa so
unfortun as to fall in love with him and to pai hi debt eight year
ago wa of servic to him also in anoth wai sole by her exert
and sacrific a crimin charg involv an element of fantast
and homicid brutal for which he might well have been sentenc to
siberia wa hush up that the sort of man he is if you care to
know
good heaven cri pulcheria alexandrovna raskolnikov listen
attent
ar you speak the truth when you sai that you have good evid of
thi dounia ask sternli and emphat
i onli repeat what i wa told in secret by marfa petrovna i must
observ that from the legal point of view the case wa far from clear
there wa and i believ still is live here a woman call resslich
a foreign who lent small sum of monei at interest and did other
commiss and with thi woman svidrigalov had for a long while close
and mysteri relat she had a relat a niec i believ live
with her a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen or perhap not more than
fourteen resslich hate thi girl and grudg her everi crust she
us to beat her mercilessli on dai the girl wa found hang in
the garret at the inquest the verdict wa suicid after the usual
proceed the matter end but later on inform wa given that
the child had been cruelli outrag by svidrigalov it is true thi
wa not clearli establish the inform wa given by anoth german
woman of loos charact whose word could not be trust no statement
wa actual made to the polic thank to marfa petrovna monei and
exert it did not get beyond gossip and yet the stori is a veri
signific on you heard no doubt avdotya romanovna when you were
with them the stori of the servant philip who di of ill treatment he
receiv six year ago befor the abolit of serfdom
i heard on the contrari that thi philip hang himself
quit so but what drove him or rather perhap dispos him
to suicid wa the systemat persecut and sever of mr
svidrigalov
i dont know that answer dounia dryli i onli heard a queer stori
that philip wa a sort of hypochondriac a sort of domest philosoph
the servant us to sai he read himself silli and that he hang
himself partli on account of mr svidrigalov mockeri of him and not
hi blow when i wa there he behav well to the servant and thei
were actual fond of him though thei certainli did blame him for
philip death
i perceiv avdotya romanovna that you seem dispos to undertak hi
defenc all of a sudden luzhin observ twist hi lip into
an ambigu smile there no doubt that he is an astut man and
insinu where ladi ar concern of which marfa petrovna who ha
di so strang is a terribl instanc my onli desir ha been to be
of servic to you and your mother with my advic in view of the renew
effort which mai certainli be anticip from him for my part it
my firm convict that he will end in a debtor prison again
marfa petrovna had not the slightest intent of settl anyth
substanti on him have regard for hi children interest and
if she left him anyth it would onli be the merest suffici
someth insignific and ephemer which would not last a year for a
man of hi habit

work with anger then he turn went out and rare ha ani man
carri awai in hi heart such vindict hatr as he felt against
raskolnikov him and him alon he blame for everyth it is
noteworthi that as he went downstair he still imagin that hi case
wa perhap not utterli lost and that so far as the ladi were
concern all might veri well inde be set right again
chapter iii
the fact wa that up to the last moment he had never expect such an
end he had been overbear to the last degre never dream that
two destitut and defenceless women could escap from hi control thi
convict wa strengthen by hi vaniti and conceit a conceit to
the point of fatuiti pyotr petrovitch who had made hi wai up from
insignific wa morbidli given to selfadmir had the highest
opinion of hi intellig and capac and sometim even gloat
in solitud over hi imag in the glass but what he love and valu
abov all wa the monei he had amass by hi labour and by all sort
of devic that monei made him the equal of all who had been hi
superior
when he had bitterli remind dounia that he had decid to take her in
spite of evil report pyotr petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincer
and had inde felt genuin indign at such black ingratitud
and yet when he made dounia hi offer he wa fulli awar of the
groundless of all the gossip the stori had been everywher
contradict by marfa petrovna and wa by then disbeliev by all the
townspeopl who were warm in douniaa defenc and he would not have
deni that he knew all that at the time yet he still thought highli
of hi own resolut in lift dounia to hi level and regard it as
someth heroic in speak of it to dounia he had let out the secret
feel he cherish and admir and he could not understand that
other should fail to admir it too he had call on raskolnikov with
the feel of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruit of hi good
deed and to hear agreeabl flatteri and as he went downstair now he
consid himself most undeservedli injur and unrecognis
dounia wa simpli essenti to him to do without her wa unthink
for mani year he had had voluptu dream of marriag but he had
gone on wait and amass monei he brood with relish in profound
secret over the imag of a girlvirtu poor she must be poor
veri young veri pretti of good birth and educ veri timid on
who had suffer much and wa complet humbl befor him on who
would all her life look on him as her saviour worship him admir him
and onli him how mani scene how mani amor episod he had imagin
on thi seduct and play theme when hi work wa over and
behold the dream of so mani year wa all but realis the beauti and
educ of avdotya romanovna had impress him her helpless posit
had been a great allur in her he had found even more than he
dream of here wa a girl of pride charact virtu of educ
and breed superior to hi own he felt that and thi creatur would
be slavishli grate all her life for hi heroic condescens and
would humbl herself in the dust befor him and he would have absolut
unbound power over her not long befor he had too after long
reflect and hesit made an import chang in hi career and
wa now enter on a wider circl of busi with thi chang hi
cherish dream of rise into a higher class of societi seem like
to be realis he wa in fact determin to try hi fortun
in petersburg he knew that women could do a veri great deal the
fascin of a charm virtuou highli educ woman might make
hi wai easier might do wonder in attract peopl to him throw
an aureol round him and now everyth wa in ruin thi sudden
horribl ruptur affect him like a clap of thunder it wa like a
hideou joke an absurd he had onli been a tini bit master
had not even time to speak out had simpli made a joke been carri
awayand it had end so serious and of cours too he did love
dounia in hi own wai he alreadi possess her in hi dreamsand all
at onc no the next dai the veri next dai it must all be set right
smooth over settl abov all he must crush that conceit milksop
who wa the caus of it all with a sick feel he could not help
recal razumihin too but he soon reassur himself on that score
as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him the man
he realli dread in earnest wa svidrigalov he had in short a
great deal to attend to
no i i am more to blame than anyon said dounia kiss and
embrac her mother i wa tempt by hi monei but on my honour
brother i had no idea he wa such a base man if i had seen through him
befor noth would have tempt me dont blame me brother
god ha deliv us god ha deliv us pulcheria alexandrovna
mutter but half conscious as though scarc abl to realis what
had happen
thei were all reliev and in five minut thei were laugh onli now
and then dounia turn white and frown rememb what had pass
pulcheria alexandrovna wa surpris to find that she too wa glad
she had onli that morn thought ruptur with luzhin a terribl
misfortun razumihin wa delight he did not yet dare to express hi
joi fulli but he wa in a fever of excit as though a tonweight
had fallen off hi heart now he had the right to devot hi life to
them to serv them anyth might happen now but he felt afraid to
think of further possibl and dare not let hi imagin
rang but raskolnikov sat still in the same place almost sullen and
indiffer though he had been the most insist on get rid of
luzhin he seem now the least concern at what had happen dounia
could not help think that he wa still angri with her and pulcheria
alexandrovna watch him timidli
what did svidrigalov sai to you said dounia approach him
ye ye cri pulcheria alexandrovna
raskolnikov rais hi head
he want to make you a present of ten thousand roubl and he desir
to see you onc in my presenc

offer her monei
then raskolnikov repeat rather dryli hi convers with
svidrigalov omit hi account of the ghostli visit of marfa
petrovna wish to avoid all unnecessari talk
what answer did you give him ask dounia
at first i said i would not take ani messag to you then he said that
he would do hi utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help
he assur me that hi passion for you wa a pass infatu now he
ha no feel for you he doesnt want you to marri luzhin hi talk

how do you explain him to yourself rodya how did he strike you
i must confess i dont quit understand him he offer you ten
thousand and yet sai he is not well off he sai he is go awai and
in ten minut he forget he ha said it then he sai he is go to be
marri and ha alreadi fix on the girl no doubt he ha a motiv
and probabl a bad on but it odd that he should be so clumsi about
it if he had ani design against you of cours i refus thi
monei on your account onc for all altogeth i thought him veri
strang on might almost think he wa mad but i mai be mistaken
that mai onli be the part he assum the death of marfa petrovna seem
to have made a great impress on him
god rest her soul exclaim pulcheria alexandrovna i shall alwai
alwai prai for her where should we be now dounia without thi three
thousand it as though it had fallen from heaven why rodya thi
morn we had onli three roubl in our pocket and dounia and i were
just plan to pawn her watch so as to avoid borrow from that man
until he offer help
dounia seem strang impress by svidrigalov offer she still

almost shudder
raskolnikov notic thi disproportion terror

avdotya romanovna
dounia smile and held out her hand but the look of anxieti did not
leav her face pulcheria alexandrovna gaze at her timidli but the
three thousand roubl had obvious a sooth effect on her
a quarter of an hour later thei were all engag in a live
convers even raskolnikov listen attent for some time
though he did not talk razumihin wa the speaker
and why why should you go awai he flow on ecstat and what

but perhap there is no god at all raskolnikov answer with a sort
of malign laugh and look at her
sonia face suddenli chang a tremor pass over it she look at
him with unutter reproach tri to sai someth but could not
speak and broke into bitter bitter sob hide her face in her hand
you sai katerina ivanovna mind is unhing your own mind is
unhing he said after a brief silenc
five minut pass he still pace up and down the room in silenc not
look at her at last he went up to her hi ey glitter he put
hi two hand on her shoulder and look straight into her tear
face hi ey were hard feverish and pierc hi lip were
twitch all at onc he bent down quickli and drop to the
ground kiss her foot sonia drew back from him as from a madman and
certainli he look like a madman
what ar you do to me she mutter turn pale and a sudden
anguish clutch at her heart
he stood up at onc
i did not bow down to you i bow down to all the suffer of
human he said wildli and walk awai to the window listen he
ad turn to her a minut later i said just now to an insol
man that he wa not worth your littl finger and that i did my sister
honour make her sit besid you
ach you said that to them and in her presenc cri sonia
frighten sit down with me an honour why im dishonour
ah why did you sai that
it wa not becaus of your dishonour and your sin i said that of you
but becaus of your great suffer but you ar a great sinner that
true he ad almost solemnli and your worst sin is that you have
destroi and betrai yourself for noth isnt that fear isnt
it fear that you ar live in thi filth which you loath so and at
the same time you know yourself youv onli to open your ey that you
ar not help anyon by it not save anyon from anyth tell me
he went on almost in a frenzi how thi shame and degrad can exist
in you side by side with other opposit holi feel it would be
better a thousand time better and wiser to leap into the water and end
it all
but what would becom of them sonia ask faintli gaze at him with
ey of anguish but not seem surpris at hi suggest
raskolnikov look strang at her he read it all in her face so she
must have had that thought alreadi perhap mani time and earnestli
she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestli that
now she scarc wonder at hi suggest she had not even notic
the cruelti of hi word the signific of hi reproach and hi
peculiar attitud to her shame she had of cours not notic either
and that too wa clear to him but he saw how monstrous the thought
of her disgrac shame posit wa tortur her and had long
tortur her what what he thought could hitherto have hinder
her from put an end to it onli then he realis what those poor
littl orphan children and that piti halfcrazi katerina ivanovna
knock her head against the wall in her consumpt meant for sonia
but nevertheless it wa clear to him again that with her charact and
the amount of educ she had after all receiv she could not in ani
case remain so he wa still confront by the question how could she
have remain so long in that posit without go out of her mind
sinc she could not bring herself to jump into the water of cours he
knew that sonia posit wa an except case though unhappili not
uniqu and not infrequ inde but that veri exception her
ting of educ her previou life might on would have thought
have kill her at the first step on that revolt path what held her
upsur not deprav all that infami had obvious onli touch
her mechan not on drop of real deprav had penetr to her
heart he saw that he saw through her as she stood befor him
there ar three wai befor her he thought the canal the madhous
or at last to sink into deprav which obscur the mind and turn
the heart to stone
the last idea wa the most revolt but he wa a sceptic he wa
young abstract and therefor cruel and so he could not help believ
that the last end wa the most like
but can that be true he cri to himself can that creatur who ha
still preserv the puriti of her spirit be conscious drawn at last
into that sink of filth and iniqu can the process alreadi have
begun can it be that she ha onli been abl to bear it till now
becaus vice ha begun to be less loathsom to her no no that cannot
be he cri as sonia had just befor no what ha kept her from the
canal till now is the idea of sin and thei the children and if she
ha not gone out of her mind but who sai she ha not gone out of her
mind is she in her sens can on talk can on reason as she doe
how can she sit on the edg of the abyss of loathsom into which she
is slip and refus to listen when she is told of danger doe she
expect a miracl no doubt she doe doesnt that all mean mad
he stai obstin at that thought he like that explan inde
better than ani other he began look more intent at her
so you prai to god a great deal sonia he ask her
sonia did not speak he stood besid her wait for an answer
what should i be without god she whisper rapidli forcibl
glanc at him with suddenli flash ey and squeez hi hand
ah so that is it he thought
and what doe god do for you he ask probe her further
sonia wa silent a long while as though she could not answer her weak
chest kept heav with emot
be silent dont ask you dont deserv she cri suddenli look
sternli and wrathfulli at him
that it that it he repeat to himself
he doe everyth she whisper quickli look down again
that the wai out that the explan he decid scrutinis
her with eager curios with a new strang almost morbid feel
he gaze at that pale thin irregular angular littl face those soft
blue ey which could flash with such fire such stern energi that
littl bodi still shake with indign and angerand it all seem
to him more and more strang almost imposs she is a religi
maniac he repeat to himself
there wa a book ly on the chest of drawer he had notic it everi
time he pace up and down the room now he took it up and look at it
it wa the new testament in the russian translat it wa bound in
leather old and worn

tabl lean hi head on hi hand and look awai sullenli prepar to

raskolnikov saw in part why sonia could not bring herself to read to him
and the more he saw thi the more roughli and irrit he insist on
her do so he understood onli too well how pain it wa for her
to betrai and unveil all that wa her own he understood that these
feel realli were her secret treasur which she had kept perhap
for year perhap from childhood while she live with an unhappi
father and a distract stepmoth craze by grief in the midst of
starv children and unseemli abus and reproach but at the same
time he knew now and knew for certain that although it fill her with
dread and suffer yet she had a torment desir to read and to read

chapter v
when next morn at eleven oclock punctual raskolnikov went into the
depart of the investig of crimin caus and sent hi name in
to porfiri petrovitch he wa surpris at be kept wait so long
it wa at least ten minut befor he wa summon he had expect
that thei would pounc upon him but he stood in the waitingroom and
peopl who appar had noth to do with him were continu
pass to and fro befor him in the next room which look like an
offic sever clerk were sit write and obvious thei had
no notion who or what raskolnikov might be he look uneasili and
suspici about him to see whether there wa not some guard some
mysteri watch be kept on him to prevent hi escap but there wa
noth of the sort he saw onli the face of clerk absorb in petti
detail then other peopl no on seem to have ani concern with him
he might go where he like for them the convict grew stronger in him
that if that enigmat man of yesterdai that phantom sprung out of the
earth had seen everyth thei would not have let him stand and wait
like that and would thei have wait till he elect to appear at
eleven either the man had not yet given inform or or simpli
he knew noth had seen noth and how could he have seen anyth
and so all that had happen to him the dai befor wa again a phantom
exagger by hi sick and overstrain imagin thi conjectur
had begun to grow strong the dai befor in the midst of all hi
alarm and despair think it all over now and prepar for a fresh
conflict he wa suddenli awar that he wa tremblingand he felt a
rush of indign at the thought that he wa trembl with fear at
face that hate porfiri petrovitch what he dread abov all wa
meet that man again he hate him with an intens unmitig hatr
and wa afraid hi hatr might betrai him hi indign wa such
that he ceas trembl at onc he made readi to go in with a cold and
arrog bear and vow to himself to keep as silent as possibl
to watch and listen and for onc at least to control hi overstrain
nerv at that moment he wa summon to porfiri petrovitch
he found porfiri petrovitch alon in hi studi hi studi wa a room
neither larg nor small furnish with a larg writingt that
stood befor a sofa upholst in check materi a bureau a
bookcas in the corner and sever chairsal govern furnitur
of polish yellow wood in the further wall there wa a close door
beyond it there were no doubt other room on raskolnikov entranc
porfiri petrovitch had at onc close the door by which he had come in
and thei remain alon he met hi visitor with an appar genial
and goodtemp air and it wa onli after a few minut that
raskolnikov saw sign of a certain awkward in him as though he had
been thrown out of hi reckon or caught in someth veri secret
ah my dear fellow here you ar in our domain began porfiri
hold out both hand to him come sit down old man or perhap
you dont like to be call my dear fellow and old mantout
court pleas dont think it too familiar here on the sofa
raskolnikov sat down keep hi ey fix on him in our domain
the apolog for familiar the french phrase tout court were all
characterist sign
he held out both hand to me but he did not give me oneh drew it
back in time struck him suspici both were watch each other
but when their ey met quick as lightn thei look awai
i brought you thi paper about the watch here it is is it all
right or shall i copi it again
what a paper ye ye dont be uneasi it all right porfiri
petrovitch said as though in hast and after he had said it he took the
paper and look at it ye it all right noth more is need
he declar with the same rapid and he laid the paper on the tabl
a minut later when he wa talk of someth els he took it from the
tabl and put it on hi bureau
i believ you said yesterdai you would like to question me
formal about my acquaint with the murder woman raskolnikov
wa begin again why did i put in i believ pass through
hi mind in a flash why am i so uneasi at have put in that i
believ came in a second flash and he suddenli felt that hi
uneasi at the mere contact with porfiri at the first word at the
first look had grown in an instant to monstrou proport and that
thi wa fearfulli danger hi nerv were quiver hi emot wa
increas it bad it bad i shall sai too much again
ye ye ye there no hurri there no hurri mutter porfiri
petrovitch move to and fro about the tabl without ani appar aim
as it were make dash toward the window the bureau and the tabl
at on moment avoid raskolnikov suspici glanc then again
stand still and look him straight in the face
hi fat round littl figur look veri strang like a ball roll
from on side to the other and rebound back
weve plenti of time do you smoke have you your own here a
cigarett he went on offer hi visitor a cigarett you know i am
receiv you here but my own quarter ar through there you know my
govern quarter but i am live outsid for the time i had to
have some repair done here it almost finish now govern

iron

though he had just thought of someth quit differ ye a capit
thing he almost shout at last suddenli stare at raskolnikov and
stop short two step from him
thi stupid repetit wa too incongru in it ineptitud with the
seriou brood and enigmat glanc he turn upon hi visitor
but thi stir raskolnikov spleen more than ever and he could not
resist an iron and rather incauti challeng
tell me pleas he ask suddenli look almost insol at him
and take a kind of pleasur in hi own insol i believ it a
sort of legal rule a sort of legal traditionfor all investig
lawyersto begin their attack from afar with a trivial or at least
an irrelev subject so as to encourag or rather to divert the man
thei ar crossexamin to disarm hi caution and then all at onc to
give him an unexpect knockdown blow with some fatal question isnt
that so it a sacr tradit mention i fanci in all the manual
of the art
ye ye why do you imagin that wa why i spoke about govern
quarter eh
and as he said thi porfiri petrovitch screw up hi ey and wink
a goodhumour crafti look pass over hi face the wrinkl on hi
forehead were smooth out hi ey contract hi featur broaden
and he suddenli went off into a nervou prolong laugh shake all
over and look raskolnikov straight in the face the latter forc
himself to laugh too but when porfiri see that he wa laugh
broke into such a guffaw that he turn almost crimson raskolnikov
repuls overcam all precaut he left off laugh scowl and
stare with hatr at porfiri keep hi ey fix on him while hi
intention prolong laughter last there wa lack of precaut on
both side howev for porfiri petrovitch seem to be laugh in
hi visitor face and to be veri littl disturb at the annoy with
which the visitor receiv it the latter fact wa veri signific
in raskolnikov ey he saw that porfiri petrovitch had not been
embarrass just befor either but that he raskolnikov had perhap
fallen into a trap that there must be someth some motiv here
unknown to him that perhap everyth wa in readi and in
anoth moment would break upon him
he went straight to the point at onc rose from hi seat and took hi
cap
porfiri petrovitch he began resolut though with consider
irrit yesterdai you express a desir that i should come to you

convers ladi for instanc peopl in high societi alwai have
their subject of convers cest de rigueur but peopl of the
middl sort like us think peopl that is ar alwai tongueti

keep harp on the same note like a drum there is to be a reform and
we shall be call by a differ name at least heheh and as for
our legal tradit as you so wittili call it i thoroughli agre

lawyer cannot be bound by formal at everi step the work of
investig is so to speak a free art in it own wai heheh
porfiri petrovitch took breath a moment he had simpli babbl on
utter empti phrase let slip a few enigmat word and again
revert to incoher he wa almost run about the room move
hi fat littl leg quicker and quicker look at the ground with hi
right hand behind hi back while with hi left make gesticul
that were extraordinarili incongru with hi word raskolnikov
suddenli notic that as he ran about the room he seem twice to stop
for a moment near the door as though he were listen
is he expect anyth
you ar certainli quit right about it porfiri began gaili look
with extraordinari simplic at raskolnikov which startl him and
instantli put him on hi guard certainli quit right in laugh so
wittili at our legal form hehe some of these elabor psycholog
method ar exceedingli ridicul and perhap useless if on adher
too close to the form ye i am talk of form again well if
i recognis or more strictli speak if i suspect someon or other to
be a crimin in ani case entrust to me your read for the law
of cours rodion romanovitch
ye i wa
well then it is a preced for you for the futurethough dont
suppos i should ventur to instruct you after the articl you publish
about crime no i simpli make bold to state it by wai of fact if i
took thi man or that for a crimin why i ask should i worri him
prematur even though i had evid against him in on case i mai
be bound for instanc to arrest a man at onc but anoth mai be in
quit a differ posit you know so why shouldnt i let him walk
about the town a bit heheh but i see you dont quit understand so
ill give you a clearer exampl if i put him in prison too soon i
mai veri like give him so to speak moral support hehe your
laugh
raskolnikov had no idea of laugh he wa sit with compress
lip hi feverish ey fix on porfiri petrovitch
yet that is the case with some type especi for men ar so
differ you sai evid well there mai be evid but
evid you know can gener be taken two wai i am an examin
lawyer and a weak man i confess it i should like to make a proof so
to sai mathemat clear i should like to make a chain of evid
such as twice two ar four it ought to be a direct irrefut proof
and if i shut him up too sooneven though i might be convinc he
wa the man i should veri like be depriv myself of the mean of
get further evid against him and how by give him so to
speak a definit posit i shall put him out of suspens and set hi
mind at rest so that he will retreat into hi shell thei sai that at
sevastopol soon after alma the clever peopl were in a terribl fright
that the enemi would attack openli and take sevastopol at onc but when
thei saw that the enemi prefer a regular sieg thei were delight
i am told and reassur for the thing would drag on for two month at
least your laugh you dont believ me again of cours your
right too your right your right these ar special case i
admit but you must observ thi my dear rodion romanovitch the
gener case the case for which all legal form and rule ar intend
for which thei ar calcul and laid down in book doe not exist at
all for the reason that everi case everi crime for instanc so soon
as it actual occur at onc becom a thoroughli special case and
sometim a case unlik ani that gone befor veri comic case of that
sort sometim occur if i leav on man quit alon if i dont touch
him and dont worri him but let him know or at least suspect everi
moment that i know all about it and am watch him dai and night and
if he is in continu suspicion and terror hell be bound to lose hi
head hell come of himself or mayb do someth which will make it as
plain as twice two ar fourit delight it mai be so with a simpl
peasant but with on of our sort an intellig man cultiv on a
certain side it a dead certainti for my dear fellow it a veri
import matter to know on what side a man is cultiv and then
there ar nerv there ar nerv you have overlook them why thei
ar all sick nervou and irrit and then how thei all suffer
from spleen that i assur you is a regular goldmin for us and it
no anxieti to me hi run about the town free let him let him walk
about for a bit i know well enough that iv caught him and that he
wont escap me where could he escap to hehe abroad perhap a
pole will escap abroad but not here especi as i am watch
and have taken measur will he escap into the depth of the countri
perhap but you know peasant live there real rude russian peasant
a modern cultiv man would prefer prison to live with such
stranger as our peasant hehe but that all nonsens and on
the surfac it not mere that he ha nowher to run to he is
psycholog unabl to escap me hehe what an express
through a law of natur he cant escap me if he had anywher to go
have you seen a butterfli round a candl that how he will keep
circl and circl round me freedom will lose it attract hell
begin to brood hell weav a tangl round himself hell worri himself
to death what more he will provid me with a mathemat proofif i
onli give him long enough interv and hell keep circl round
me get nearer and nearer and thenflop hell fly straight into my
mouth and ill swallow him and that will be veri amus heheh you
dont believ me
raskolnikov made no repli he sat pale and motionless still gaze with
the same intens into porfiri face
it a lesson he thought turn cold thi is beyond the cat
plai with a mous like yesterdai he cant be show off hi power
with no motiv prompt me he is far too clever for that he must
have anoth object what is it it all nonsens my friend you ar
pretend to scare me youv no proof and the man i saw had no
real exist you simpli want to make me lose my head to work me up
beforehand and so to crush me but you ar wrong you wont do it but
why give me such a hint is he reckon on my shatter nerv no my
friend you ar wrong you wont do it even though you have some trap
for me let us see what you have in store for me
and he brace himself to face a terribl and unknown ordeal at time
he long to fall on porfiri and strangl him thi anger wa what he
dread from the begin he felt that hi parch lip were fleck
with foam hi heart wa throb but he wa still determin not to
speak till the right moment he realis that thi wa the best
polici in hi posit becaus instead of sai too much he would be
irrit hi enemi by hi silenc and provok him into speak too
freeli anyhow thi wa what he hope for
no i see you dont believ me you think i am plai a harmless joke
on you porfiri began again get more and more live chuckl
at everi instant and again pace round the room and to be sure your
right god ha given me a figur that can awaken none but comic idea in
other peopl a buffoon but let me tell you and i repeat it excus
an old man my dear rodion romanovitch you ar a man still young so to
sai in your first youth and so you put intellect abov everyth like
all young peopl play wit and abstract argument fascin you and
that for all the world like the old austrian hofkriegsrath as
far as i can judg of militari matter that is on paper theyd beaten
napoleon and taken him prison and there in their studi thei work it
all out in the cleverest fashion but look you gener mack surrend
with all hi armi heheh i see i see rodion romanovitch you ar
laugh at a civilian like me take exampl out of militari histori
but i cant help it it my weak i am fond of militari scienc
and im ever so fond of read all militari histori iv certainli
miss my proper career i ought to have been in the armi upon my
word i ought i shouldnt have been a napoleon but i might have been a
major hehe well ill tell you the whole truth my dear fellow about
thi special case i mean actual fact and a man tempera my
dear sir ar weighti matter and it astonish how thei sometim
deceiv the sharpest calcul ilisten to an old manam speak
serious rodion romanovitch as he said thi porfiri petrovitch who
wa scarc fiveandthirti actual seem to have grown old even
hi voic chang and he seem to shrink togeth moreov im
a candid man am i a candid man or not what do you sai i fanci i
realli am i tell you these thing for noth and dont even expect a
reward for it hehe well to proce wit in my opinion is a splendid
thing it is so to sai an adorn of natur and a consol of
life and what trick it can plai so that it sometim is hard for a
poor examin lawyer to know where he is especi when he liabl
to be carri awai by hi own fanci too for you know he is a man after
all but the poor fellow is save by the crimin tempera wors
luck for him but young peopl carri awai by their own wit dont think
of that when thei overstep all obstacl as you wittili and cleverli
express it yesterdai he will liethat is the man who is a special
case the incognito and he will lie well in the cleverest fashion
you might think he would triumph and enjoi the fruit of hi wit but at
the most interest the most flagrant moment he will faint of cours
there mai be ill and a stuffi room as well but anywai anywai he
given us the idea he li incompar but he didnt reckon on hi
tempera that what betrai him anoth time he will be carri
awai by hi play wit into make fun of the man who suspect him he
will turn pale as it were on purpos to mislead but hi pale will
be too natur too much like the real thing again he ha given us
an idea though hi question mai be deceiv at first he will think
differ next dai if he is not a fool and of cours it is like
that at everi step he put himself forward where he is not want
speak continu when he ought to keep silent bring in all sort of
allegor allus hehe come and ask why didnt you take me long
ago heheh and that can happen you know with the cleverest man
the psychologist the literari man the tempera reflect everyth
like a mirror gaze into it and admir what you see but why ar you so
pale rodion romanovitch is the room stuffi shall i open the window
oh dont troubl pleas cri raskolnikov and he suddenli broke
into a laugh pleas dont troubl

decant of water in the corner come drink a littl he whisper
rush up to him with the decant it will be sure to do you good
porfiri petrovitch alarm and sympathi were so natur that raskolnikov
wa silent and began look at him with wild curios he did not take
the water howev

though he still look rather disconcert good heaven you must
take more care of yourself dmitri prokofitch wa here came to see me
yesterdayi know i know iv a nasti iron temper but what thei
made of it good heaven he came yesterdai after youd been we
dine and he talk and talk awai and i could onli throw up my hand
in despair did he come from you but do sit down for merci sake sit
down
no not from me but i knew he went to you and why he went
raskolnikov answer sharpli
you knew
i knew what of it
why thi rodion romanovitch that i know more than that about you
i know about everyth i know how you went to take a flat at night
when it wa dark and how you rang the bell and ask about the blood so
that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it ye i
understand your state of mind at that time but youll drive yourself
mad like that upon my word youll lose your head your full of
gener indign at the wrong youv receiv first from destini
and then from the polic offic and so you rush from on thing to
anoth to forc them to speak out and make an end of it all becaus
you ar sick of all thi suspicion and foolish that so isnt
it i have guess how you feel havent i onli in that wai youll
lose your head and razumihin too he too good a man for such
a posit you must know that you ar ill and he is good and your
ill is infecti for him ill tell you about it when you ar
more yourself but do sit down for good sake pleas rest you
look shock do sit down
raskolnikov sat down he no longer shiver he wa hot all over in
amaz he listen with strain attent to porfiri petrovitch who
still seem frighten as he look after him with friendli solicitud
but he did not believ a word he said though he felt a strang
inclin to believ porfiri unexpect word about the flat had
utterli overwhelm him how can it be he know about the flat then
he thought suddenli and he tell it me himself
ye in our legal practic there wa a case almost exactli similar a
case of morbid psycholog porfiri went on quickli a man confess to
murder and how he kept it up it wa a regular hallucin he brought
forward fact he impos upon everyon and why he had been partli but
onli partli unintention the caus of a murder and when he knew that
he had given the murder the opportun he sank into deject it
got on hi mind and turn hi brain he began imagin thing and he
persuad himself that he wa the murder but at last the high court
of appeal went into it and the poor fellow wa acquit and put under
proper care thank to the court of appeal tuttuttut why my dear
fellow you mai drive yourself into delirium if you have the impuls
to work upon your nerv to go ring bell at night and ask about
blood iv studi all thi morbid psycholog in my practic a man
is sometim tempt to jump out of a window or from a belfri just the
same with bellring it all ill rodion romanovitch you
have begun to neglect your ill you should consult an experienc
doctor what the good of that fat fellow you ar lighthead you
were deliri when you did all thi
for a moment raskolnikov felt everyth go round
is it possibl is it possibl flash through hi mind that he is
still ly he cant be he cant be he reject that idea feel
to what a degre of furi it might drive him feel that that furi
might drive him mad
i wa not deliri i knew what i wa do he cri strain
everi faculti to penetr porfiri game i wa quit myself do you
hear
ye i hear and understand you said yesterdai you were not deliri
you were particularli emphat about it i understand all you can tell
me aach listen rodion romanovitch my dear fellow if you were
actual a crimin or were somehow mix up in thi damnabl busi
would you insist that you were not deliri but in full possess
of your faculti and so emphat and persist would it be
possibl quit imposs to my think if you had anyth on
your conscienc you certainli ought to insist that you were deliri
that so isnt it
there wa a note of slyness in thi inquiri raskolnikov drew back on
the sofa as porfiri bent over him and stare in silent perplex at
him
anoth thing about razumihiny certainli ought to have said that he
came of hi own accord to have conceal your part in it but you dont
conceal it you lai stress on hi come at your instig
raskolnikov had not done so a chill went down hi back
you keep tell li he said slowli and weakli twist hi lip
into a sickli smile you ar try again to show that you know all
my game that you know all i shall sai beforehand he said consciou
himself that he wa not weigh hi word as he ought you want to
frighten me or you ar simpli laugh at me
he still stare at him as he said thi and again there wa a light of
intens hatr in hi ey
you keep ly he said you know perfectli well that the best
polici for the crimin is to tell the truth as nearli as possibl to
conceal as littl as possibl i dont believ you
what a wili person you ar porfiri titter there no catch
you youv a perfect monomania so you dont believ me but still you
do believ me you believ a quarter ill soon make you believ the
whole becaus i have a sincer like for you and genuin wish you

raskolnikov lip trembl

noth but frighten them
what ha that to do with you how do you know it what concern is it of
your you ar keep watch on me and want to let me know it
good heaven why i learnt it all from you yourself you dont
notic that in your excit you tell me and other everyth from
razumihin too i learnt a number of interest detail yesterdai no
you interrupt me but i must tell you that for all your wit your
suspici make you lose the commonsens view of thing to return
to bellring for instanc i an examin lawyer have betrai a
preciou thing like that a real fact for it is a fact worth have
and you see noth in it why if i had the slightest suspicion of you
should i have act like that no i should first have disarm your
suspicion and not let you see i knew of that fact should have divert
your attent and suddenli have dealt you a knockdown blow your
express sai and what were you do sir prai at ten or
nearli eleven at the murder woman flat and why did you ring the bell
and why did you ask about blood and why did you invit the porter
to go with you to the polic station to the lieuten that how
i ought to have act if i had a grain of suspicion of you i ought to
have taken your evid in due form search your lodg and perhap
have arrest you too so i have no suspicion of you sinc i have
not done that but you cant look at it normal and you see noth i
sai again
raskolnikov start so that porfiri petrovitch could not fail to

raskolnikov walk straight home he wa so muddl and bewild that
on get home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa try to
collect hi thought he did not attempt to think about nikolai he
wa stupefi he felt that hi confess wa someth inexplic
amazingsometh beyond hi understand but nikolai confess
wa an actual fact the consequ of thi fact were clear to him at
onc it falsehood could not fail to be discov and then thei
would be after him again till then at least he wa free and must do
someth for himself for the danger wa immin
but how immin hi posit gradual becam clear to him
rememb sketchili the main outlin of hi recent scene with
porfiri he could not help shudder again with horror of cours
he did not yet know all porfiri aim he could not see into all hi
calcul but he had alreadi partli shown hi hand and no on knew
better than raskolnikov how terribl porfiri lead had been for
him a littl more and he might have given himself awai complet
circumstanti know hi nervou tempera and from the first
glanc see through him porfiri though plai a bold game wa
bound to win there no deni that raskolnikov had compromis
himself serious but no fact had come to light as yet there wa
noth posit but wa he take a true view of the posit wasnt
he mistaken what had porfiri been try to get at had he realli some
surpris prepar for him and what wa it had he realli been expect
someth or not how would thei have part if it had not been for the
unexpect appear of nikolai
porfiri had shown almost all hi cardsof cours he had risk
someth in show themand if he had realli had anyth up hi
sleev raskolnikov reflect he would have shown that too what wa
that surpris wa it a joke had it meant anyth could it have
conceal anyth like a fact a piec of posit evid hi
yesterdai visitor what had becom of him where wa he todai if
porfiri realli had ani evid it must be connect with him
he sat on the sofa with hi elbow on hi knee and hi face hidden in
hi hand he wa still shiver nervous at last he got up took hi
cap thought a minut and went to the door
he had a sort of presenti that for todai at least he might
consid himself out of danger he had a sudden sens almost of joi he
want to make hast to katerina ivanovna he would be too late for
the funer of cours but he would be in time for the memori dinner
and there at onc he would see sonia
he stood still thought a moment and a suffer smile came for a
moment on to hi lip
todai todai he repeat to himself ye todai so it must
be
but as he wa about to open the door it began open of itself he
start and move back the door open gentli and slowli and there
suddenli appear a figureyesterdai visitor from underground
the man stood in the doorwai look at raskolnikov without speak
and took a step forward into the room he wa exactli the same as
yesterdai the same figur the same dress but there wa a great chang
in hi face he look deject and sigh deepli if he had onli put
hi hand up to hi cheek and lean hi head on on side he would have
look exactli like a peasant woman
what do you want ask raskolnikov numb with terror the man wa
still silent but suddenli he bow down almost to the ground touch
it with hi finger
what is it cri raskolnikov
i have sin the man articul softli
how
by evil thought
thei look at on anoth
i wa vex when you came perhap in drink and bade the porter go
to the polic station and ask about the blood i wa vex that thei
let you go and took you for drunken i wa so vex that i lost my
sleep and rememb the address we came here yesterdai and ask for

clearli befor raskolnikov mind he recollect that there had
been sever peopl there besid the porter women among them
he rememb on voic had suggest take him straight to the
policest he could not recal the face of the speaker and even
now he did not recognis it but he rememb that he had turn round
and made him some answer
so thi wa the solut of yesterdai horror the most aw thought
wa that he had been actual almost lost had almost done for himself
on account of such a trivial circumst so thi man could tell
noth except hi ask about the flat and the blood stain so
porfiri too had noth but that delirium no fact but thi
psycholog which cut both wai noth posit so if no more
fact come to light and thei must not thei must not then then
what can thei do to him how can thei convict him even if thei arrest
him and porfiri then had onli just heard about the flat and had not
known about it befor
wa it you who told porfiri that id been there he cri struck
by a sudden idea

inquiri and find out yesterdai where to go i went todai the
first time i went he wasnt there when i came an hour later he couldnt

to me scold and question me he scold me a great deal and i
told him everyth and i told him that you didnt dare to sai a word
in answer to me yesterdai and that you didnt recognis me and he
fell to run about again and kept hit himself on the chest and
get angri and run about and when you were announc he told
me to go into the next room sit there a bit he said dont move
whatev you mai hear and he set a chair there for me and lock
me in perhap he said i mai call you and when nikolayd been
brought he let me out as soon as you were gone i shall send for you
again and question you he said
and did he question nikolai while you were there
he got rid of me as he did of you befor he spoke to nikolai
the man stood still and again suddenli bow down touch the ground
with hi finger
forgiv me for my evil thought and my slander
mai god forgiv you answer raskolnikov
and as he said thi the man bow down again but not to the ground
turn slowli and went out of the room
it all cut both wai now it all cut both wai repeat
raskolnikov and he went out more confid than ever
now well make a fight for it he said with a malici smile as he
went down the stair hi malic wa aim at himself with shame and
contempt he recollect hi cowardic
part v
chapter i
the morn that follow the fate interview with dounia and
her mother brought sober influenc to bear on pyotr petrovitch
intens unpleas as it wa he wa forc littl by littl to accept
as a fact beyond recal what had seem to him onli the dai befor
fantast and incred the black snake of wound vaniti had been
gnaw at hi heart all night when he got out of bed pyotr petrovitch
immedi look in the lookingglass he wa afraid that he had
jaundic howev hi health seem unimpair so far and look at
hi nobl clearskin counten which had grown fattish of
late pyotr petrovitch for an instant wa posit comfort in the
convict that he would find anoth bride and perhap even a better
on but come back to the sens of hi present posit he turn
asid and spat vigor which excit a sarcast smile in andrei
semyonovitch lebeziatnikov the young friend with whom he wa stai
that smile pyotr petrovitch notic and at onc set it down against hi
young friend account he had set down a good mani point against him
of late hi anger wa redoubl when he reflect that he ought not to
have told andrei semyonovitch about the result of yesterdai interview
that wa the second mistak he had made in temper through impuls
and irrit moreov all that morn on unpleas
follow anoth he even found a hitch await him in hi legal case
in the senat he wa particularli irrit by the owner of the flat
which had been taken in view of hi approach marriag and wa be
redecor at hi own expens the owner a rich german tradesman
would not entertain the idea of break the contract which had just
been sign and insist on the full forfeit monei though pyotr
petrovitch would be give him back the flat practic redecor in
the same wai the upholster refus to return a singl roubl of the
instal paid for the furnitur purchas but not yet remov to the
flat
am i to get marri simpli for the sake of the furnitur pyotr
petrovitch ground hi teeth and at the same time onc more he had a
gleam of desper hope can all that be realli so irrevoc over
is it no us to make anoth effort the thought of dounia sent a
voluptu pang through hi heart he endur anguish at that moment
and if it had been possibl to slai raskolnikov instantli by wish it
pyotr petrovitch would promptli have utter the wish
it wa my mistak too not to have given them monei he thought as
he return dejectedli to lebeziatnikov room and why on earth wa i
such a jew it wa fals economi i meant to keep them without a penni
so that thei should turn to me as their provid and look at them
foo if id spent some fifteen hundr roubl on them for the trousseau
and present on knickknack dressingcas jewelleri materi and
all that sort of trash from knopp and the english shop my posit
would have been better and stronger thei could not have refus me
so easili thei ar the sort of peopl that would feel bound to return
monei and present if thei broke it off and thei would find it hard to
do it and their conscienc would prick them how can we dismiss a man
who ha hitherto been so gener and delic hm iv made a
blunder
and grind hi teeth again pyotr petrovitch call himself a
foolbut not aloud of cours
he return home twice as irrit and angri as befor the
prepar for the funer dinner at katerina ivanovna excit
hi curios as he pass he had heard about it the dai befor he
fanci inde that he had been invit but absorb in hi own care
he had paid no attent inquir of madam lippevechsel who wa busi
lai the tabl while katerina ivanovna wa awai at the cemeteri he
heard that the entertain wa to be a great affair that all the
lodger had been invit among them some who had not known the dead
man that even andrei semyonovitch lebeziatnikov wa invit in spite of
hi previou quarrel with katerina ivanovna that he pyotr petrovitch
wa not onli invit but wa eagerli expect as he wa the most
import of the lodger amalia ivanovna herself had been invit with
great ceremoni in spite of the recent unpleas and so she wa
veri busi with prepar and wa take a posit pleasur in them
she wa moreov dress up to the nine all in new black silk and she
wa proud of it all thi suggest an idea to pyotr petrovitch and he
went into hi room or rather lebeziatnikov somewhat thought he
had learnt that raskolnikov wa to be on of the guest
andrei semyonovitch had been at home all the morn the attitud of
pyotr petrovitch to thi gentleman wa strang though perhap natur
pyotr petrovitch had despis and hate him from the dai he came to stai
with him and at the same time he seem somewhat afraid of him he
had not come to stai with him on hi arriv in petersburg simpli from
parsimoni though that had been perhap hi chief object he had heard
of andrei semyonovitch who had onc been hi ward as a lead young
progress who wa take an import part in certain interest
circl the do of which were a legend in the provinc it had
impress pyotr petrovitch these power omnisci circl who
despis everyon and show everyon up had long inspir in him a
peculiar but quit vagu alarm he had not of cours been abl to form
even an approxim notion of what thei meant he like everyon had
heard that there were especi in petersburg progress of some
sort nihilist and so on and like mani peopl he exagger and
distort the signific of those word to an absurd degre what for
mani year past he had fear more than anyth wa be shown
up and thi wa the chief ground for hi continu uneasi at the
thought of transfer hi busi to petersburg he wa afraid of
thi as littl children ar sometim panicstricken some year befor
when he wa just enter on hi own career he had come upon two case
in which rather import personag in the provinc patron of hi
had been cruelli shown up on instanc had end in great scandal
for the person attack and the other had veri nearli end in seriou
troubl for thi reason pyotr petrovitch intend to go into the
subject as soon as he reach petersburg and if necessari to
anticip conting by seek the favour of our younger
gener he reli on andrei semyonovitch for thi and befor
hi visit to raskolnikov he had succeed in pick up some current
phrase he soon discov that andrei semyonovitch wa a commonplac
simpleton but that by no mean reassur pyotr petrovitch even if he
had been certain that all the progress were fool like him it
would not have allai hi uneasi all the doctrin the idea the
system with which andrei semyonovitch pester him had no interest for
him he had hi own objecth simpli want to find out at onc what
wa happen here had these peopl ani power or not had he anyth
to fear from them would thei expos ani enterpris of hi and what
precis wa now the object of their attack could he somehow make up
to them and get round them if thei realli were power wa thi the
thing to do or not couldnt he gain someth through them in fact
hundr of question present themselv
andrei semyonovitch wa an anmic scroful littl man with strang
flaxen muttonchop whisker of which he wa veri proud he wa a clerk
and had almost alwai someth wrong with hi ey he wa rather
softheart but selfconfid and sometim extrem conceit in
speech which had an absurd effect incongru with hi littl figur
he wa on of the lodger most respect by amalia ivanovna for he did
not get drunk and paid regularli for hi lodg andrei semyonovitch
realli wa rather stupid he attach himself to the caus of progress
and our younger gener from enthusiasm he wa on of the numer
and vari legion of dullard of halfanim abort conceit
halfeduc coxcomb who attach themselv to the idea most in
fashion onli to vulgaris it and who caricatur everi caus thei serv
howev sincer
though lebeziatnikov wa so goodnatur he too wa begin to
dislik pyotr petrovitch thi happen on both side unconsci
howev simpl andrei semyonovitch might be he began to see that pyotr
petrovitch wa dupe him and secretli despis him and that he wa
not the right sort of man he had tri expound to him the system of
fourier and the darwinian theori but of late pyotr petrovitch began to
listen too sarcast and even to be rude the fact wa he had begun
instinct to guess that lebeziatnikov wa not mere a commonplac
simpleton but perhap a liar too and that he had no connect of
ani consequ even in hi own circl but had simpli pick thing up
thirdhand and that veri like he did not even know much about hi own
work of propaganda for he wa in too great a muddl a fine person he
would be to show anyon up it must be note by the wai that pyotr
petrovitch had dure those ten dai eagerli accept the strangest
prais from andrei semyonovitch he had not protest for instanc
when andrei semyonovitch belaud him for be readi to contribut to
the establish of the new commun or to abstain from christen
hi futur children or to acquiesc if dounia were to take a lover a
month after marriag and so on pyotr petrovitch so enjoi hear
hi own prais that he did not disdain even such virtu when thei were
attribut to him
pyotr petrovitch had had occas that morn to realis some
fiveperc bond and now he sat down to the tabl and count over
bundl of note andrei semyonovitch who hardli ever had ani monei
walk about the room pretend to himself to look at all those bank
note with indiffer and even contempt noth would have convinc
pyotr petrovitch that andrei semyonovitch could realli look on the monei
unmov and the latter on hi side kept think bitterli that pyotr
petrovitch wa capabl of entertain such an idea about him and
wa perhap glad of the opportun of teas hi young friend by
remind him of hi inferior and the great differ between them
he found him incred inattent and irrit though he andrei
semyonovitch began enlarg on hi favourit subject the foundat
of a new special commun the brief remark that drop from pyotr
petrovitch between the click of the bead on the reckon frame
betrai unmistak and discourt ironi but the human andrei
semyonovitch ascrib pyotr petrovitch illhumour to hi recent breach
with dounia and he wa burn with impati to discours on that
theme he had someth progress to sai on the subject which
might consol hi worthi friend and could not fail to promot hi
develop
there is some sort of festiv be prepar at that at the
widow isnt there pyotr petrovitch ask suddenli interrupt
andrei semyonovitch at the most interest passag
why dont you know why i wa tell you last night what i think
about all such ceremoni and she invit you too i heard you were
talk to her yesterdai
i should never have expect that beggarli fool would have spent on
thi feast all the monei she got from that other fool raskolnikov i
wa surpris just now as i came through at the prepar there the
wine sever peopl ar invit it beyond everyth continu
pyotr petrovitch who seem to have some object in pursu the
convers what you sai i am ask too when wa that i dont
rememb but i shant go why should i i onli said a word to her in
pass yesterdai of the possibl of her obtain a year salari as
a destitut widow of a govern clerk i suppos she ha invit me on
that account hasnt she heheh
i dont intend to go either said lebeziatnikov
i should think not after give her a thrash you might well
hesit hehe
who thrash whom cri lebeziatnikov fluster and blush
why you thrash katerina ivanovna a month ago i heard so
yesterdai so that what your convict amount to and the woman
question too wasnt quit sound heheh and pyotr petrovitch as
though comfort went back to click hi bead
it all slander and nonsens cri lebeziatnikov who wa alwai
afraid of allus to the subject it wa not like that at all it
wa quit differ youv heard it wrong it a libel i wa simpli
defend myself she rush at me first with her nail she pull
out all my whisker it permiss for anyon i should hope
to defend himself and i never allow anyon to us violenc to me on
principl for it an act of despot what wa i to do i simpli
push her back
heheh luzhin went on laugh malici
you keep on like that becaus you ar out of humour yourself but
that nonsens and it ha noth noth whatev to do with the
woman question you dont understand i us to think inde that
if women ar equal to men in all respect even in strength as is
maintain now there ought to be equal in that too of cours i
reflect afterward that such a question ought not realli to aris
for there ought not to be fight and in the futur societi fight is
unthink and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equal

what of it i think that is it is my own person convict that
thi is the normal condit of women why not i mean distinguon
in our present societi it is not altogeth normal becaus it is
compulsori but in the futur societi it will be perfectli normal
becaus it will be voluntari even as it is she wa quit right she
wa suffer and that wa her asset so to speak her capit which
she had a perfect right to dispos of of cours in the futur
societi there will be no need of asset but her part will have anoth
signific ration and in harmoni with her environ as to sofya
semyonovna person i regard her action as a vigor protest against
the organis of societi and i respect her deepli for it i rejoic
inde when i look at her
i wa told that you got her turn out of these lodg
lebeziatnikov wa enrag
that anoth slander he yell it wa not so at all that wa all
katerina ivanovna invent for she did not understand and i never
made love to sofya semyonovna i wa simpli develop her entir
disinterestedli try to rous her to protest all i want wa her
protest and sofya semyonovna could not have remain here anywai
have you ask her to join your commun

you you dont understand there is no such rle in a commun the
commun is establish that there should be no such rle in a
commun such a rle is essenti transform and what is stupid
here is sensibl there what under present condit is unnatur

that all that modesti is nonsens
not at all not at all how coars how stupidlyexcus me sai
soyou misunderstand the word develop good heaven how crude
you still ar we ar strive for the freedom of women and you have
onli on idea in your head set asid the gener question

resolut in protestingwhich she ha alreadi shown oncesh ha
littl selfreli littl so to sai independ so as to
break free from certain prejudic and certain foolish idea yet she

avers tfoo how vex i am that when i wa expound our system i
refer prematur to the question of person privaci it alwai
a stumblingblock to peopl like you thei turn it into ridicul befor

maintain that that question should not be approach by a novic till
he ha a firm faith in the system and tell me pleas what do you
find so shame even in cesspool i should be the first to be readi
to clean out ani cesspool you like and it not a question of
selfsacrific it simpli work honour us work which is
as good as ani other and much better than the work of a raphael and a
pushkin becaus it is more us
and more honour more honour heheh
what do you mean by more honour i dont understand such
express to describ human activ more honour nobleral
those ar oldfashion prejudic which i reject everyth which is

there is on circumst of which i ought to warn you beforehand and
for which i ventur to troubl you sofya semyonovna to come here in
my opinion monei cannot be inde it unsaf to put it into katerina
ivanovna own hand the dinner todai is a proof of that though she
ha not so to speak a crust of bread for tomorrow and well boot
or shoe or anyth she ha bought todai jamaica rum and even
i believ madeira and and coffe i saw it as i pass through
tomorrow it will all fall upon you again thei wont have a crust of

onli you for instanc am i right
i dont know thi is onli todai onc in her life she wa
so anxiou to do honour to celebr the memori and she is veri

unfold sonia took it flush crimson jump up mutter someth
and began take leav pyotr petrovitch accompani her ceremoni
to the door she got out of the room at last agit and distress

all thi time lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walk about the
room anxiou not to interrupt the convers when sonia had gone he
walk up to pyotr petrovitch and solemnli held out hi hand
i heard and saw everyth he said lai stress on the last verb
that is honour i mean to sai it human you want to avoid
gratitud i saw and although i cannot i confess in principl
sympathis with privat chariti for it not onli fail to erad the
evil but even promot it yet i must admit that i saw your action with
pleasurey ye i like it
that all nonsens mutter pyotr petrovitch somewhat disconcert
look carefulli at lebeziatnikov
no it not nonsens a man who ha suffer distress and annoy as
you did yesterdai and who yet can sympathis with the miseri of other
such a man even though he is make a social mistakei still
deserv of respect i did not expect it inde of you pyotr
petrovitch especi as accord to your idea oh what a drawback
your idea ar to you how distress you ar for instanc by your
illluck yesterdai cri the simpleheart lebeziatnikov who felt
a return of affect for pyotr petrovitch and what do you want with
marriag with legal marriag my dear nobl pyotr petrovitch why do
you cling to thi legal of marriag well you mai beat me if you
like but i am glad posit glad it hasnt come off that you ar
free that you ar not quit lost for human you see iv spoken
my mind
becaus i dont want in your free marriag to be made a fool of and
to bring up anoth man children that why i want legal marriag
luzhin repli in order to make some answer
he seem preoccupi by someth
children you refer to children lebeziatnikov start off like
a warhors at the trumpet call children ar a social question and a
question of first import i agre but the question of children ha
anoth solut some refus to have children altogeth becaus thei
suggest the institut of the famili well speak of children later
but now as to the question of honour i confess that my weak point
that horrid militari pushkin express is unthink in the
dictionari of the futur what doe it mean inde it nonsens
there will be no decept in a free marriag that is onli the natur
consequ of a legal marriag so to sai it correct a protest
so that inde it not humili and if i ever to suppos an
absurd were to be legal marri i should be posit glad of
it i should sai to my wife my dear hitherto i have love you now
i respect you for youv shown you can protest you laugh that
becaus you ar incap of get awai from prejudic confound
it all i understand now where the unpleas is of be deceiv
in a legal marriag but it simpli a despic consequ of a
despic posit in which both ar humili when the decept is
open as in a free marriag then it doe not exist it unthink
your wife will onli prove how she respect you by consid you
incap of oppos her happi and aveng yourself on her for
her new husband damn it all i sometim dream if i were to be marri
pfoo i mean if i were to marri legal or not it just the same
i should present my wife with a lover if she had not found on for
herself my dear i should sai i love you but even more than that i
desir you to respect me see am i not right
pyotr petrovitch snigger as he listen but without much merriment
he hardli heard it inde he wa preoccupi with someth els and
even lebeziatnikov at last notic it pyotr petrovitch seem excit
and rub hi hand lebeziatnikov rememb all thi and reflect
upon it afterward
chapter ii
it would be difficult to explain exactli what could have origin the
idea of that senseless dinner in katerina ivanovna disord brain
nearli ten of the twenti roubl given by raskolnikov for marmeladov
funer were wast upon it possibl katerina ivanovna felt oblig to
honour the memori of the deceas suitabl that all the lodger
and still more amalia ivanovna might know that he wa in no wai their
inferior and perhap veri much their superior and that no on had the
right to turn up hi nose at him perhap the chief element wa that
peculiar poor man pride which compel mani poor peopl to spend
their last save on some tradit social ceremoni simpli in order
to do like other peopl and not to be look down upon it is veri
probabl too that katerina ivanovna long on thi occas at
the moment when she seem to be abandon by everyon to show those
wretch contempt lodger that she knew how to do thing how
to entertain and that she had been brought up in a genteel she might
almost sai aristocrat colonel famili and had not been meant for
sweep floor and wash the children rag at night even the
poorest and most brokenspirit peopl ar sometim liabl to these
paroxysm of pride and vaniti which take the form of an irresist
nervou crave and katerina ivanovna wa not brokenspirit she
might have been kill by circumst but her spirit could not have
been broken that is she could not have been intimid her will
could not be crush moreov sonia had said with good reason that her
mind wa unhing she could not be said to be insan but for a year
past she had been so harass that her mind might well be overstrain
the later stage of consumpt ar apt doctor tell us to affect the
intellect
there wa no great varieti of wine nor wa there madeira but wine
there wa there wa vodka rum and lisbon wine all of the poorest
qualiti but in suffici quantiti besid the tradit rice and
honei there were three or four dish on of which consist of
pancak all prepar in amalia ivanovna kitchen two samovar were
boil that tea and punch might be offer after dinner katerina
ivanovna had herself seen to purchas the provis with the help
of on of the lodger an unfortun littl pole who had somehow been
strand at madam lippevechsel he promptli put himself at katerina
ivanovna dispos and had been all that morn and all the dai befor
run about as fast as hi leg could carri him and veri anxiou
that everyon should be awar of it for everi trifl he ran to katerina
ivanovna even hunt her out at the bazaar at everi instant call
her pani she wa heartili sick of him befor the end though
she had declar at first that she could not have got on without thi
servic and magnanim man it wa on of katerina ivanovna
characterist to paint everyon she met in the most glow colour
her prais were so exagger as sometim to be embarrass she
would invent variou circumst to the credit of her new acquaint
and quit genuin believ in their realiti then all of a sudden she
would be disillus and would rude and contemptu repuls the
person she had onli a few hour befor been liter ador she
wa natur of a gai live and peacelov disposit but from
continu failur and misfortun she had come to desir so keenli
that all should live in peac and joi and should not dare to break the
peac that the slightest jar the smallest disast reduc her almost
to frenzi and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hope and
fanci to curs her fate and rave and knock her head against
the wall
amalia ivanovna too suddenli acquir extraordinari import in
katerina ivanovna ey and wa treat by her with extraordinari
respect probabl onli becaus amalia ivanovna had thrown herself heart
and soul into the prepar she had undertaken to lai the tabl
to provid the linen crockeri etc and to cook the dish in her
kitchen and katerina ivanovna had left it all in her hand and gone
herself to the cemeteri everyth had been well done even the
tablecloth wa nearli clean the crockeri knive fork and glass
were of cours of all shape and pattern lent by differ lodger
but the tabl wa properli laid at the time fix and amalia ivanovna
feel she had done her work well had put on a black silk dress and
a cap with new mourn ribbon and met the return parti with some
pride thi pride though justifi displeas katerina ivanovna for
some reason as though the tabl could not have been laid except by
amalia ivanovna she dislik the cap with new ribbon too could she
be stuck up the stupid german becaus she wa mistress of the hous
and had consent as a favour to help her poor lodger as a favour
fanci that katerina ivanovna father who had been a colonel and almost
a governor had sometim had the tabl set for forti person and then
anyon like amalia ivanovna or rather ludwigovna would not have been
allow into the kitchen
katerina ivanovna howev put off express her feel for the
time and content herself with treat her coldli though she decid
inwardli that she would certainli have to put amalia ivanovna down
and set her in her proper place for good onli knew what she wa
fanci herself katerina ivanovna wa irrit too by the fact that
hardli ani of the lodger invit had come to the funer except
the pole who had just manag to run into the cemeteri while to the
memori dinner the poorest and most insignific of them had turn
up the wretch creatur mani of them not quit sober the older
and more respect of them all as if by common consent stai awai
pyotr petrovitch luzhin for instanc who might be said to be the most
respect of all the lodger did not appear though katerina ivanovna
had the even befor told all the world that is amalia ivanovna
polenka sonia and the pole that he wa the most gener
nobleheart man with a larg properti and vast connect who had
been a friend of her first husband and a guest in her father
hous and that he had promis to us all hi influenc to secur her
a consider pension it must be note that when katerina ivanovna
exalt anyon connect and fortun it wa without ani ulterior
motiv quit disinterestedli for the mere pleasur of ad to
the consequ of the person prais probabl take hi cue from
luzhin that contempt wretch lebeziatnikov had not turn up
either what did he fanci himself he wa onli ask out of kind
and becaus he wa share the same room with pyotr petrovitch and wa a
friend of hi so that it would have been awkward not to invit him
among those who fail to appear were the genteel ladi and her
oldmaidish daughter who had onli been lodger in the hous for the
last fortnight but had sever time complain of the nois and uproar
in katerina ivanovna room especi when marmeladov had come
back drunk katerina ivanovna heard thi from amalia ivanovna who
quarrel with katerina ivanovna and threaten to turn the whole
famili out of door had shout at her that thei were not worth the
foot of the honour lodger whom thei were disturb katerina
ivanovna determin now to invit thi ladi and her daughter whose
foot she wa not worth and who had turn awai haughtili when she
casual met them so that thei might know that she wa more nobl in
her thought and feel and did not harbour malic and might see
that she wa not accustom to her wai of live she had propos to
make thi clear to them at dinner with allus to her late father
governorship and also at the same time to hint that it wa exceedingli
stupid of them to turn awai on meet her the fat colonelmajor he
wa realli a discharg offic of low rank wa also absent but it
appear that he had been not himself for the last two dai the parti
consist of the pole a wretch look clerk with a spotti face and
a greasi coat who had not a word to sai for himself and smelt
abomin a deaf and almost blind old man who had onc been in the
post offic and who had been from immemori ag maintain by someon
at amalia ivanovna
a retir clerk of the commissariat depart came too he wa
drunk had a loud and most unseemli laugh and onli fancywa without
a waistcoat on of the visitor sat straight down to the tabl without
even greet katerina ivanovna final on person have no suit
appear in hi dressinggown but thi wa too much and the effort of
amalia ivanovna and the pole succeed in remov him the pole brought
with him howev two other pole who did not live at amalia ivanovna
and whom no on had seen here befor all thi irrit katerina
ivanovna intens for whom had thei made all these prepar
then to make room for the visitor the children had not even been laid
for at the tabl but the two littl on were sit on a bench in the
furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box while polenka as a big
girl had to look after them feed them and keep their nose wipe like
wellbr children
katerina ivanovna in fact could hardli help meet her guest with
increas digniti and even haughti she stare at some of them with
special sever and loftili invit them to take their seat rush
to the conclus that amalia ivanovna must be respons for those who
were absent she began treat her with extrem nonchal which the
latter promptli observ and resent such a begin wa no good omen
for the end all were seat at last
raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the
cemeteri katerina ivanovna wa greatli delight to see him in the
first place becaus he wa the on educ visitor and as everyon
knew wa in two year to take a professorship in the univers and
secondli becaus he immedi and respectfulli apologis for have
been unabl to be at the funer she posit pounc upon him and
made him sit on her left hand amalia ivanovna wa on her right in
spite of her continu anxieti that the dish should be pass round
correctli and that everyon should tast them in spite of the agonis
cough which interrupt her everi minut and seem to have grown wors
dure the last few dai she hasten to pour out in a half whisper to

when she found it she would come to thank you then too that you
want to avoid thank and that as the sai is your right hand
should not know someth of that sort in fact i thought of so
mani possibl that i put off consid it but still thought it
indel to show you that i knew your secret but anoth idea struck
me again that sofya semyonovna might easili lose the monei befor she
notic it that wa why i decid to come in here to call her out of
the room and to tell her that you put a hundr roubl in her pocket
but on my wai i went first to madam kobilatnikov to take them the
gener treatis on the posit method and especi to recommend
piderit articl and also wagner then i come on here and what a
state of thing i find now could i could i have all these idea and
reflect if i had not seen you put the hundredroubl note in her
pocket
when lebeziatnikov finish hi longwind harangu with the logic
deduct at the end he wa quit tire and the perspir stream
from hi face he could not ala even express himself correctli
in russian though he knew no other languag so that he wa quit
exhaust almost emaci after thi heroic exploit but hi speech
produc a power effect he had spoken with such vehem with such
convict that everyon obvious believ him pyotr petrovitch felt
that thing were go badli with him
what is it to do with me if silli idea did occur to you he shout
that no evid you mai have dreamt it that all and i tell you
you ar ly sir you ar ly and slander from some spite against
me simpli from piqu becaus i did not agre with your freethink
godless social proposit
but thi retort did not benefit pyotr petrovitch murmur of disapprov
were heard on all side
ah that your line now is it cri lebeziatnikov that
nonsens call the polic and ill take my oath there onli on thing
i cant understand what made him risk such a contempt action oh
piti despic man
i can explain why he risk such an action and if necessari i too
will swear to it raskolnikov said at last in a firm voic and he
step forward
he appear to be firm and compos everyon felt clearli from the
veri look of him that he realli knew about it and that the mysteri would
be solv
now i can explain it all to myself said raskolnikov address
lebeziatnikov from the veri begin of the busi i suspect
that there wa some scoundrelli intrigu at the bottom of it i began
to suspect it from some special circumst known to me onli which
i will explain at onc to everyon thei account for everyth your
valuabl evid ha final made everyth clear to me i beg all
all to listen thi gentleman he point to luzhin wa recent
engag to be marri to a young ladymi sister avdotya romanovna
raskolnikov but come to petersburg he quarrel with me the dai
befor yesterdai at our first meet and i drove him out of my roomi
have two wit to prove it he is a veri spite man the dai
befor yesterdai i did not know that he wa stai here in your room

yesterdayh saw me give katerina ivanovna some monei for the funer
as a friend of the late mr marmeladov he at onc wrote a note to
my mother and inform her that i had given awai all my monei not
to katerina ivanovna but to sofya semyonovna and refer in a most
contempt wai to the charact of sofya semyonovna that is
hint at the charact of my attitud to sofya semyonovna all thi you
understand wa with the object of divid me from my mother and sister
by insinu that i wa squander on unworthi object the monei
which thei had sent me and which wa all thei had yesterdai even
befor my mother and sister and in hi presenc i declar that i had
given the monei to katerina ivanovna for the funer and not to sofya
semyonovna and that i had no acquaint with sofya semyonovna and had
never seen her befor inde at the same time i ad that he
pyotr petrovitch luzhin with all hi virtu wa not worth sofya
semyonovna littl finger though he spoke so ill of her to hi
questionwould i let sofya semyonovna sit down besid my sister i
answer that i had alreadi done so that dai irrit that my mother
and sister were unwil to quarrel with me at hi insinu he
gradual began be unpardon rude to them a final ruptur took
place and he wa turn out of the hous all thi happen yesterdai

have shown to my mother and sister that he wa almost right in hi
suspicion that he had reason to be angri at my put my sister on
a level with sofya semyonovna that in attack me he wa protect
and preserv the honour of my sister hi betroth in fact he might
even through all thi have been abl to estrang me from my famili
and no doubt he hope to be restor to favour with them to sai noth
of reveng himself on me person for he ha ground for suppos
that the honour and happi of sofya semyonovna ar veri preciou to
me that wa what he wa work for that how i understand it that
the whole reason for it and there can be no other
it wa like thi or somewhat like thi that raskolnikov wound up hi
speech which wa follow veri attent though often interrupt by
exclam from hi audienc but in spite of interrupt he spoke
clearli calmli exactli firmli hi decis voic hi tone of

it for he ask me as soon as sofya semyonovna came into our room

essenti for him that you should be here that it that it
luzhin smile contemptu and did not speak but he wa veri pale he

chapter iv
raskolnikov had been a vigor and activ champion of sonia against
luzhin although he had such a load of horror and anguish in hi own
heart but have gone through so much in the morn he found a sort
of relief in a chang of sensat apart from the strong person
feel which impel him to defend sonia he wa agit too
especi at some moment by the thought of hi approach interview
with sonia he had to tell her who had kill lizaveta he knew the
terribl suffer it would be to him and as it were brush awai the
thought of it so when he cri as he left katerina ivanovna well
sofya semyonovna we shall see what youll sai now he wa still
superfici excit still vigor and defiant from hi triumph over
luzhin but strang to sai by the time he reach sonia lodg he
felt a sudden impot and fear he stood still in hesit at the
door ask himself the strang question must he tell her who kill
lizaveta it wa a strang question becaus he felt at the veri time
not onli that he could not help tell her but also that he could
not put off the tell he did not yet know why it must be so he
onli felt it and the agonis sens of hi impot befor
the inevit almost crush him to cut short hi hesit and
suffer he quickli open the door and look at sonia from the
doorwai she wa sit with her elbow on the tabl and her face in
her hand but see raskolnikov she got up at onc and came to meet
him as though she were expect him
what would have becom of me but for you she said quickli meet

all due to your social posit and the habit associ with it did
you understand that just now

pleas dont begin it there is miseri enough without that
she made hast to smile afraid that he might not like the reproach

he told her that amalia ivanovna wa turn them out of their lodg
and that katerina ivanovna had run off somewher to seek justic

physic organ of the insan and that insan is so to sai a
logic mistak an error of judgment an incorrect view of thing he
gradual show the madman hi error and would you believ it thei

chapter i
a strang period began for raskolnikov it wa as though a fog had
fallen upon him and wrap him in a dreari solitud from which there
wa no escap recal that period long after he believ that hi
mind had been cloud at time and that it had continu so with
interv till the final catastroph he wa convinc that he had been
mistaken about mani thing at that time for instanc as to the date
of certain event anywai when he tri later on to piec hi
recollect togeth he learnt a great deal about himself from what
other peopl told him he had mix up incid and had explain
event as due to circumst which exist onli in hi imagin at
time he wa a prei to agoni of morbid uneasi amount sometim
to panic but he rememb too moment hour perhap whole dai
of complet apathi which came upon him as a reaction from hi previou
terror and might be compar with the abnorm insens sometim
seen in the dy he seem to be try in that latter stage to escap
from a full and clear understand of hi posit certain essenti
fact which requir immedi consider were particularli irksom
to him how glad he would have been to be free from some care the
neglect of which would have threaten him with complet inevit
ruin
he wa particularli worri about svidrigalov he might be said to be
perman think of svidrigalov from the time of svidrigalov
too menac and unmistak word in sonia room at the moment of
katerina ivanovna death the normal work of hi mind seem to
break down but although thi new fact caus him extrem uneasi
raskolnikov wa in no hurri for an explan of it at time find
himself in a solitari and remot part of the town in some wretch
eatinghous sit alon lost in thought hardli know how he had
come there he suddenli thought of svidrigalov he recognis
suddenli clearli and with dismai that he ought at onc to come to an
understand with that man and to make what term he could walk
outsid the citi gate on dai he posit fanci that thei had
fix a meet there that he wa wait for svidrigalov anoth
time he woke up befor daybreak ly on the ground under some bush
and could not at first understand how he had come there
but dure the two or three dai after katerina ivanovna death he
had two or three time met svidrigalov at sonia lodg where he
had gone aimlessli for a moment thei exchang a few word and made no
refer to the vital subject as though thei were tacitli agre not
to speak of it for a time
katerina ivanovna bodi wa still ly in the coffin svidrigalov wa
busi make arrang for the funer sonia too wa veri busi at
their last meet svidrigalov inform raskolnikov that he had made
an arrang and a veri satisfactori on for katerina ivanovna
children that he had through certain connect succeed in get
hold of certain personag by whose help the three orphan could be at
onc place in veri suitabl institut that the monei he had settl
on them had been of great assist as it is much easier to place
orphan with some properti than destitut on he said someth
too about sonia and promis to come himself in a dai or two to see
raskolnikov mention that he would like to consult with him that
there were thing thei must talk over
thi convers took place in the passag on the stair svidrigalov
look intent at raskolnikov and suddenli after a brief paus
drop hi voic ask but how is it rodion romanovitch you
dont seem yourself you look and you listen but you dont seem to
understand cheer up well talk thing over i am onli sorri iv
so much to do of my own busi and other peopl ah rodion

air more than anyth
he move to on side to make wai for the priest and server who
were come up the stair thei had come for the requiem servic by
svidrigalov order it wa sung twice a dai punctual svidrigalov
went hi wai raskolnikov stood still a moment thought and follow
the priest into sonia room he stood at the door thei began quietli
slowli and mournfulli sing the servic from hi childhood the
thought of death and the presenc of death had someth oppress
and mysteri aw and it wa long sinc he had heard the requiem

raskolnikov stai all through the servic as he bless them and
took hi leav the priest look round strang after the servic
raskolnikov went up to sonia she took both hi hand and let her
head sink on hi shoulder thi slight friendli gestur bewild
raskolnikov it seem strang to him that there wa no trace of
repugn no trace of disgust no tremor in her hand it wa the
furthest limit of selfabneg at least so he interpret it
sonia said noth raskolnikov press her hand and went out he felt
veri miser if it had been possibl to escap to some solitud he
would have thought himself lucki even if he had to spend hi whole life
there but although he had almost alwai been by himself of late he had
never been abl to feel alon sometim he walk out of the town on to
the high road onc he had even reach a littl wood but the loneli
the place wa the more he seem to be awar of an uneasi presenc near
him it did not frighten him but greatli annoi him so that he
made hast to return to the town to mingl with the crowd to enter
restaur and tavern to walk in busi thoroughfar there he felt
easier and even more solitari on dai at dusk he sat for an hour
listen to song in a tavern and he rememb that he posit
enjoi it but at last he had suddenli felt the same uneasi again
as though hi conscienc smote him here i sit listen to sing
is that what i ought to be do he thought yet he felt at onc
that that wa not the onli caus of hi uneasi there wa someth
requir immedi decis but it wa someth he could not clearli
understand or put into word it wa a hopeless tangl no better the
struggl again better porfiri again or svidrigalov better some
challeng again some attack ye ye he thought he went out of
the tavern and rush awai almost at a run the thought of dounia and
hi mother suddenli reduc him almost to a panic that night he woke
up befor morn among some bush in krestovski island trembl
all over with fever he walk home and it wa earli morn when he

head wa fresher and he wa calmer than he had been for the last three

the door open and razumihin came in
ah he eat then he not ill said razumihin he took a chair
and sat down at the tabl opposit raskolnikov
he wa troubl and did not attempt to conceal it he spoke with evid

while the porter and the two wit were go up he got up on
purpos to disarm suspicion the cun the presenc of mind of the
young dog on can hardli credit it but it hi own explan he
ha confess it all and what a fool i wa about it well he simpli
a geniu of hypocrisi and resourc in disarm the suspicion of
the lawyersso there noth much to wonder at i suppos of cours
peopl like that ar alwai possibl and the fact that he couldnt keep
up the charact but confess make him easier to believ in but
what a fool i wa i wa frantic on their side
tell me pleas from whom did you hear that and why doe it interest
you so raskolnikov ask with unmistak agit
what next you ask me why it interest me well i heard it from
porfiri among other it wa from him i heard almost all about it
from porfiri
from porfiri
what what did he sai raskolnikov ask in dismai
he gave me a capit explan of it psycholog after hi
fashion
he explain it explain it himself
ye ye goodby ill tell you all about it anoth time but now
im busi there wa a time when i fanci but no matter anoth
time what need is there for me to drink now you have made me drunk

he went out
he a polit conspir there not a doubt about it razumihin
decid as he slowli descend the stair and he drawn hi sister
in that quit quit in keep with avdotya romanovna charact
there ar interview between them she hint at it too so mani of
her word and hint bear that mean and how els can all thi
tangl be explain hm and i wa almost think good heaven
what i thought ye i took leav of my sens and i wrong him it wa
hi do under the lamp in the corridor that dai pfoo what a crude
nasti vile idea on my part nikolai is a brick for confess and
how clear it all is now hi ill then all hi strang action
befor thi in the univers how moros he us to be how gloomi
but what the mean now of that letter there someth in that
too perhap whom wa it from i suspect no i must find out
he thought of dounia realis all he had heard and hi heart throb
and he suddenli broke into a run
as soon as razumihin went out raskolnikov got up turn to the window
walk into on corner and then into anoth as though forget the
small of hi room and sat down again on the sofa he felt so to
speak renew again the struggl so a mean of escap had come
ye a mean of escap had come it had been too stifl too
cramp the burden had been too agonis a lethargi had come upon
him at time from the moment of the scene with nikolai at porfiri he
had been suffoc pen in without hope of escap after nikolai
confess on that veri dai had come the scene with sonia hi
behaviour and hi last word had been utterli unlik anyth he
could have imagin beforehand he had grown feebler instantli and
fundament and he had agre at the time with sonia he had agre
in hi heart he could not go on live alon with such a thing on hi
mind
and svidrigalov wa a riddl he worri him that wa true but
somehow not on the same point he might still have a struggl to come
with svidrigalov svidrigalov too might be a mean of escap but
porfiri wa a differ matter
and so porfiri himself had explain it to razumihin had explain it
psycholog he had begun bring in hi damn psycholog again
porfiri but to think that porfiri should for on moment believ that
nikolai wa guilti after what had pass between them befor nikolai
appear after that ttett interview which could have onli
on explan dure those dai raskolnikov had often recal
passag in that scene with porfiri he could not bear to let hi mind
rest on it such word such gestur had pass between them thei
had exchang such glanc thing had been said in such a tone and had
reach such a pass that nikolai whom porfiri had seen through at the
first word at the first gestur could not have shaken hi convict
and to think that even razumihin had begun to suspect the scene in the
corridor under the lamp had produc it effect then he had rush to
porfiri but what had induc the latter to receiv him like that
what had been hi object in put razumihin off with nikolai he must
have some plan there wa some design but what wa it it wa true that
a long time had pass sinc that morningtoo long a timeand no sight
nor sound of porfiri well that wa a bad sign
raskolnikov took hi cap and went out of the room still ponder it
wa the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in hi mind
at least i must settl svidrigalov he thought and as soon as
possibl he too seem to be wait for me to come to him of my own
accord and at that moment there wa such a rush of hate in hi
weari heart that he might have kill either of those twoporfiri or
svidrigalov at least he felt that he would be capabl of do it
later if not now
we shall see we shall see he repeat to himself
but no sooner had he open the door than he stumbl upon porfiri
himself in the passag he wa come in to see him raskolnikov wa
dumbfound for a minut but onli for on minut strang to sai he
wa not veri much astonish at see porfiri and scarc afraid of
him he wa simpli startl but wa quickli instantli on hi guard
perhap thi will mean the end but how could porfiri have approach
so quietli like a cat so that he had heard noth could he have been
listen at the door
you didnt expect a visitor rodion romanovitch porfiri explain
laugh iv been mean to look in a long time i wa pass by
and thought why not go in for five minut ar you go out i wont
keep you long just let me have on cigarett
sit down porfiri petrovitch sit down raskolnikov gave hi visitor
a seat with so pleas and friendli an express that he would have
marvel at himself if he could have seen it
the last moment had come the last drop had to be drain so a man
will sometim go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand
yet when the knife is at hi throat at last he feel no fear
raskolnikov seat himself directli face porfiri and look at him
without flinch porfiri screw up hi ey and began light a
cigarett
speak speak seem as though it would burst from raskolnikov
heart come why dont you speak
chapter ii
ah these cigarett porfiri petrovitch ejacul at last have
light on thei ar pernici posit pernici and yet i
cant give them up i cough i begin to have tickl in my throat and
a difficulti in breath you know i am a coward i went late to
dr bn he alwai give at least half an hour to each patient he
posit laugh look at me he sound me tobacco bad for
you he said your lung ar affect but how am i to give it up
what is there to take it place i dont drink that the mischief
heheh that i dont everyth is rel rodion romanovitch

why he plai hi profession trick again raskolnikov thought
with disgust all the circumst of their last interview suddenli
came back to him and he felt a rush of the feel that had come upon
him then
i came to see you the dai befor yesterdai in the even you didnt
know porfiri petrovitch went on look round the room i came into
thi veri room i wa pass by just as i did todai and i thought
id return your call i walk in as your door wa wide open i look
round wait and went out without leav my name with your servant
dont you lock your door
raskolnikov face grew more and more gloomi porfiri seem to guess
hi state of mind
iv come to have it out with you rodion romanovitch my dear fellow
i ow you an explan and must give it to you he continu with a
slight smile just pat raskolnikov knee
but almost at the same instant a seriou and careworn look came into hi
face to hi surpris raskolnikov saw a touch of sad in it he had
never seen and never suspect such an express in hi face
a strang scene pass between us last time we met rodion romanovitch
our first interview too wa a strang on but then and on thing
after anoth thi is the point i have perhap act unfairli to you
i feel it do you rememb how we part your nerv were unhing and
your knee were shake and so were mine and you know our behaviour
wa unseemli even ungentlemanli and yet we ar gentlemen abov all
in ani case gentlemen that must be understood do you rememb what we
came to and it wa quit indecor
what is he up to what doe he take me for raskolnikov ask himself
in amaz rais hi head and look with open ey on porfiri
iv decid open is better between us porfiri petrovitch went
on turn hi head awai and drop hi ey as though unwil to
disconcert hi former victim and as though disdain hi former wile
ye such suspicion and such scene cannot continu for long nikolai
put a stop to it or i dont know what we might not have come to that
damn workman wa sit at the time in the next roomcan you realis
that you know that of cours and i am awar that he came to you
afterward but what you suppos then wa not true i had not sent for
anyon i had made no kind of arrang you ask why i hadnt what
shall i sai to you it had all come upon me so suddenli i had scarc
sent for the porter you notic them as you went out i dare sai
an idea flash upon me i wa firmli convinc at the time you see
rodion romanovitch come i thoughteven if i let on thing slip for
a time i shall get hold of someth elsei shant lose what i want
anywai you ar nervous irrit rodion romanovitch by tempera
it out of proport with other qualiti of your heart and charact
which i flatter myself i have to some extent divin of cours i did
reflect even then that it doe not alwai happen that a man get up and
blurt out hi whole stori it doe happen sometim if you make a
man lose all patienc though even then it rare i wa capabl of
realis that if i onli had a fact i thought the least littl fact
to go upon someth i could lai hold of someth tangibl not
mere psycholog for if a man is guilti you must be abl to get
someth substanti out of him on mai reckon upon most surpris
result inde i wa reckon on your tempera rodion romanovitch
on your tempera abov all thing i had great hope of you at that
time
but what ar you drive at now raskolnikov mutter at last ask
the question without think

take me to be innoc
what am i drive at iv come to explain myself i consid it my
duti so to speak i want to make clear to you how the whole busi
the whole misunderstand aros iv caus you a great deal of
suffer rodion romanovitch i am not a monster i understand what
it must mean for a man who ha been unfortun but who is proud
imperi and abov all impati to have to bear such treatment
i regard you in ani case as a man of nobl charact and not without
element of magnanim though i dont agre with all your convict
i want to tell you thi first frankli and quit sincer for abov
all i dont want to deceiv you when i made your acquaint i felt
attract by you perhap you will laugh at my sai so you have a
right to i know you dislik me from the first and inde youv no
reason to like me you mai think what you like but i desir now to do
all i can to effac that impress and to show that i am a man of heart
and conscienc i speak sincer
porfiri petrovitch made a dignifi paus raskolnikov felt a rush of
renew alarm the thought that porfiri believ him to be innoc
began to make him uneasi
it scarc necessari to go over everyth in detail porfiri
petrovitch went on inde i could scarc attempt it to begin with
there were rumour through whom how and when those rumour came to
me and how thei affect you i need not go into my suspicion
were arous by a complet accid which might just as easili not have
happen what wa it hm i believ there is no need to go into that
either those rumour and that accid led to on idea in my mind i
admit it openlyfor on mai as well make a clean breast of iti wa
the first to pitch on you the old woman note on the pledg and
the rest of itthat all came to noth your wa on of a hundr
i happen too to hear of the scene at the offic from a man who
describ it capit unconsci reproduc the scene with great
vivid it wa just on thing after anoth rodion romanovitch my
dear fellow how could i avoid be brought to certain idea from a
hundr rabbit you cant make a hors a hundr suspicion dont make
a proof as the english proverb sai but that onli from the ration
point of viewyou cant help be partial for after all a lawyer
is onli human i thought too of your articl in that journal do you
rememb on your first visit we talk of it i jeer at you at the
time but that wa onli to lead you on i repeat rodion romanovitch
you ar ill and impati that you were bold headstrong in earnest
and had felt a great deal i recognis long befor i too have felt
the same so that your articl seem familiar to me it wa conceiv
on sleepless night with a throb heart in ecstasi and suppress
enthusiasm and that proud suppress enthusiasm in young peopl is
danger i jeer at you then but let me tell you that as a literari
amateur i am awfulli fond of such first essai full of the heat of
youth there is a misti and a chord vibrat in the mist your
articl is absurd and fantast but there a transpar sincer
a youth incorrupt pride and the dare of despair in it it a
gloomi articl but that what fine in it i read your articl and
put it asid think as i did so that man wont go the common wai
well i ask you after that as a preliminari how could i help be
carri awai by what follow oh dear i am not sai anyth i
am not make ani statement now i simpli note it at the time what is
there in it i reflect there noth in it that is realli noth
and perhap absolut noth and it not at all the thing for
the prosecutor to let himself be carri awai by notion here i have
nikolai on my hand with actual evid against himyou mai think what
you like of it but it evid he bring in hi psycholog too on
ha to consid him too for it a matter of life and death why am
i explain thi to you that you mai understand and not blame my
malici behaviour on that occas it wa not malici i assur
you hehe do you suppos i didnt come to search your room at the
time i did i did hehe i wa here when you were ly ill in bed
not offici not in my own person but i wa here your room wa
search to the last thread at the first suspicion but umsonst i
thought to myself now that man will come will come of himself and
quickli too if he guilti he sure to come anoth man wouldnt
but he will and you rememb how mr razumihin began discuss the
subject with you we arrang that to excit you so we purpos spread
rumour that he might discuss the case with you and razumihin is not a
man to restrain hi indign mr zametov wa tremend struck by
your anger and your open dare think of blurt out in a restaur
i kill her it wa too dare too reckless i thought so myself if
he is guilti he will be a formid oppon that wa what i thought
at the time i wa expect you but you simpli bowl zametov over
and well you see it all li in thisthat thi damnabl psycholog
can be taken two wai well i kept expect you and so it wa you
came my heart wa fairli throb ach
now why need you have come your laughter too as you came in do you
rememb i saw it all plain as daylight but if i hadnt expect you
so special i should not have notic anyth in your laughter you
see what influenc a mood ha mr razumihin thenah that stone that
stone under which the thing were hidden i seem to see it somewher
in a kitchen garden it wa in a kitchen garden you told zametov and
afterward you repeat that in my offic and when we began pick
your articl to piec how you explain it on could take everi word
of your in two sens as though there were anoth mean hidden
so in thi wai rodion romanovitch i reach the furthest limit and
knock my head against a post i pull myself up ask myself what
i wa about after all i said you can take it all in anoth sens if
you like and it more natur so inde i couldnt help admit
it wa more natur i wa bother no id better get hold of some
littl fact i said so when i heard of the bellring i held my
breath and wa all in a tremor here is my littl fact thought i and
i didnt think it over i simpli wouldnt i would have given a thousand
roubl at that minut to have seen you with my own ey when you
walk a hundr pace besid that workman after he had call you
murder to your face and you did not dare to ask him a question
all the wai and then what about your trembl what about your
bellring in your ill in semidelirium
and so rodion romanovitch can you wonder that i plai such prank on
you and what made you come at that veri minut someon seem to
have sent you by jove and if nikolai had not part us and do you
rememb nikolai at the time do you rememb him clearli it wa a
thunderbolt a regular thunderbolt and how i met him i didnt believ
in the thunderbolt not for a minut you could see it for yourself
and how could i even afterward when you had gone and he began make
veri veri plausibl answer on certain point so that i wa surpris
at him myself even then i didnt believ hi stori you see what it is
to be as firm as a rock no thought i morgenfrh what ha nikolai
got to do with it
razumihin told me just now that you think nikolai guilti and had
yourself assur him of it
hi voic fail him and he broke off he had been listen in
indescrib agit as thi man who had seen through and through
him went back upon himself he wa afraid of believ it and did not
believ it in those still ambigu word he kept eagerli look for
someth more definit and conclus
mr razumihin cri porfiri petrovitch seem glad of a question
from raskolnikov who had till then been silent heheh but i had to
put mr razumihin off two is compani three is none mr razumihin is
not the right man besid he is an outsid he came run to me
with a pale face but never mind him why bring him in to return
to nikolai would you like to know what sort of a type he is how i
understand him that is to begin with he is still a child and not
exactli a coward but someth by wai of an artist realli dont laugh
at my describ him so he is innoc and respons to influenc he
ha a heart and is a fantast fellow he sing and danc he tell
stori thei sai so that peopl come from other villag to hear him
he attend school too and laugh till he cri if you hold up a finger
to him he will drink himself senselessnot as a regular vice but at
time when peopl treat him like a child and he stole too then
without know it himself for how can it be steal if on pick it
up and do you know he is an old believ or rather a dissent there
have been wander in hi famili and he wa for two year in hi
villag under the spiritu guidanc of a certain elder i learnt all
thi from nikolai and from hi fellow villag and what more he
want to run into the wilder he wa full of fervour prai at
night read the old book the true on and read himself crazi
a religi secttransl note
petersburg had a great effect upon him especi the women and the
wine he respond to everyth and he forgot the elder and all that i
learnt that an artist here took a fanci to him and us to go and see
him and now thi busi came upon him
well he wa frighten he tri to hang himself he ran awai how can
on get over the idea the peopl have of russian legal proceed the
veri word trial frighten some of them whose fault is it we shall
see what the new juri will do god grant thei do good well in
prison it seem he rememb the vener elder the bibl too
made it appear again do you know rodion romanovitch the forc of
the word suffer among some of these peopl it not a question of
suffer for someon benefit but simpli on must suffer if thei
suffer at the hand of the author so much the better in my time
there wa a veri meek and mild prison who spent a whole year in prison
alwai read hi bibl on the stove at night and he read himself
crazi and so crazi do you know that on dai apropo of noth he
seiz a brick and flung it at the governor though he had done him
no harm and the wai he threw it too aim it a yard on on side
on purpos for fear of hurt him well we know what happen to
a prison who assault an offic with a weapon so he took hi
suffer
so i suspect now that nikolai want to take hi suffer or someth
of the sort i know it for certain from fact inde onli he doesnt
know that i know what you dont admit that there ar such fantast
peopl among the peasant lot of them the elder now ha begun
influenc him especi sinc he tri to hang himself but hell
come and tell me all himself you think hell hold out wait a bit
hell take hi word back i am wait from hour to hour for him to
come and abjur hi evid i have come to like that nikolai and am
studi him in detail and what do you think hehe he answer me
veri plausibl on some point he obvious had collect some evid
and prepar himself cleverli but on other point he is simpli at sea
know noth and doesnt even suspect that he doesnt know
no rodion romanovitch nikolai doesnt come in thi is a fantast
gloomi busi a modern case an incid of todai when the heart
of man is troubl when the phrase is quot that blood renew when
comfort is preach as the aim of life here we have bookish dream a
heart unhing by theori here we see resolut in the first stage
but resolut of a special kind he resolv to do it like jump over
a precipic or from a bell tower and hi leg shook as he went to the
crime he forgot to shut the door after him and murder two peopl for
a theori he commit the murder and couldnt take the monei and what
he did manag to snatch up he hid under a stone it wasnt enough for
him to suffer agoni behind the door while thei batter at the door and
rung the bell no he had to go to the empti lodg half deliri to
recal the bellring he want to feel the cold shiver over again
well that we grant wa through ill but consid thi he is
a murder but look upon himself as an honest man despis other
pose as injur innoc no that not the work of a nikolai my
dear rodion romanovitch
all that had been said befor had sound so like a recant that
these word were too great a shock raskolnikov shudder as though he
had been stab
then who then is the murder he ask in a breathless voic
unabl to restrain himself
porfiri petrovitch sank back in hi chair as though he were amaz at
the question
who is the murder he repeat as though unabl to believ hi
ear why you rodion romanovitch you ar the murder he ad
almost in a whisper in a voic of genuin convict
raskolnikov leapt from the sofa stood up for a few second and sat down
again without utter a word hi face twitch convuls
your lip is twitch just as it did befor porfiri petrovitch
observ almost sympathet youv been misunderstand me i
think rodion romanovitch he ad after a brief paus that why
you ar so surpris i came on purpos to tell you everyth and deal
openli with you
it wa not i murder her raskolnikov whisper like a frighten
child caught in the act
no it wa you you rodion romanovitch and no on els porfiri
whisper sternli with convict
thei were both silent and the silenc last strang long about ten
minut raskolnikov put hi elbow on the tabl and pass hi finger
through hi hair porfiri petrovitch sat quietli wait suddenli
raskolnikov look scornfulli at porfiri
you ar at your old trick again porfiri petrovitch your old method
again i wonder you dont get sick of it
oh stop that what doe that matter now it would be a differ
matter if there were wit present but we ar whisper alon you
see yourself that i have not come to chase and captur you like a hare
whether you confess it or not is noth to me now for myself i am
convinc without it
if so what did you come for raskolnikov ask irrit i ask you
the same question again if you consid me guilti why dont you take
me to prison
oh that your question i will answer you point for point in the
first place to arrest you so directli is not to my interest
how so if you ar convinc you ought
ach what if i am convinc that onli my dream for the time why
should i put you in safeti you know that it sinc you ask me to do
it if i confront you with that workman for instanc and you sai to him
were you drunk or not who saw me with you i simpli took you to be
drunk and you were drunk too well what could i answer especi
as your stori is a more like on than hi for there noth but
psycholog to support hi evidencethat almost unseemli with hi ugli
mug while you hit the mark exactli for the rascal is an inveter
drunkard and notori so and i have myself admit candidli sever
time alreadi that that psycholog can be taken in two wai and that the
second wai is stronger and look far more probabl and that apart from
that i have as yet noth against you and though i shall put you in
prison and inde have comequit contrari to etiquetteto inform you
of it beforehand yet i tell you frankli also contrari to etiquett
that it wont be to my advantag well secondli iv come to you

you with a direct and open propositionthat you should surrend
and confess it will be infinit more to your advantag and to my
advantag too for my task will be done well is thi open on my part

the right to put it off ani longer i must arrest you so think it over
it make no differ to me now and so i speak onli for your sake
believ me it will be better rodion romanovitch
raskolnikov smile malignantli
that not simpli ridicul it posit shameless why even if i
were guilti which i dont admit what reason should i have to confess
when you tell me yourself that i shall be in greater safeti in prison
ah rodion romanovitch dont put too much faith in word perhap
prison will not be altogeth a rest place that onli theori and
my theori and what author am i for you perhap too even now i am
hide someth from you i cant lai bare everyth hehe and how
can you ask what advantag dont you know how it would lessen your
sentenc you would be confess at a moment when anoth man ha taken
the crime on himself and so ha muddl the whole case consid that i
swear befor god that i will so arrang that your confess shall
come as a complet surpris we will make a clean sweep of all these
psycholog point of a suspicion against you so that your crime
will appear to have been someth like an aberr for in truth it
wa an aberr i am an honest man rodion romanovitch and will keep
my word
raskolnikov maintain a mourn silenc and let hi head sink
dejectedli he ponder a long while and at last smile again but hi
smile wa sad and gentl
no he said appar abandon all attempt to keep up appear
with porfiri it not worth it i dont care about lessen the
sentenc
that just what i wa afraid of porfiri cri warmli and as it
seem involuntarili that just what i fear that you wouldnt
care about the mitig of sentenc
raskolnikov look sadli and express at him

he got up again as though he meant to go awai but sat down again in
evid despair

calcul that porfiri had reach the street and move awai then he
too went hurriedli out of the room
chapter iii
he hurri to svidrigalov what he had to hope from that man he
did not know but that man had some hidden power over him have onc
recognis thi he could not rest and now the time had come
on the wai on question particularli worri him had svidrigalov been
to porfiri
as far as he could judg he would swear to it that he had not he
ponder again and again went over porfiri visit no he hadnt been
of cours he hadnt
but if he had not been yet would he go meanwhil for the present he
fanci he couldnt why he could not have explain but if he could
he would not have wast much thought over it at the moment it all
worri him and at the same time he could not attend to it strang to
sai none would have believ it perhap but he onli felt a faint vagu
anxieti about hi immedi futur anoth much more import anxieti
torment himit concern himself but in a differ more vital wai
moreov he wa consciou of immens moral fatigu though hi mind wa
work better that morn than it had done of late
and wa it worth while after all that had happen to contend with
these new trivial difficulti wa it worth while for instanc to
manoeuvr that svidrigalov should not go to porfiri wa it worth
while to investig to ascertain the fact to wast time over anyon
like svidrigalov
oh how sick he wa of it all
and yet he wa hasten to svidrigalov could he be expect
someth new from him inform or mean of escap men will
catch at straw wa it destini or some instinct bring them togeth
perhap it wa onli fatigu despair perhap it wa not svidrigalov
but some other whom he need and svidrigalov had simpli present
himself by chanc sonia but what should he go to sonia for now to beg
her tear again he wa afraid of sonia too sonia stood befor him as
an irrevoc sentenc he must go hi own wai or her at that moment
especi he did not feel equal to see her no would it not be
better to try svidrigalov and he could not help inwardli own that
he had long felt that he must see him for some reason
but what could thei have in common their veri evildo could not
be of the same kind the man moreov wa veri unpleas evid
deprav undoubtedli cun and deceit possibl malign such
stori were told about him it is true he wa befriend katerina
ivanovna children but who could tell with what motiv and what it
meant the man alwai had some design some project
there wa anoth thought which had been continu hover of late
about raskolnikov mind and caus him great uneasi it wa so
pain that he made distinct effort to get rid of it he sometim
thought that svidrigalov wa dog hi footstep svidrigalov had
found out hi secret and had had design on dounia what if he had them
still wasnt it practic certain that he had and what if have
learnt hi secret and so have gain power over him he were to us it
as a weapon against dounia
thi idea sometim even torment hi dream but it had never
present itself so vividli to him as on hi wai to svidrigalov
the veri thought move him to gloomi rage to begin with thi would
transform everyth even hi own posit he would have at onc to
confess hi secret to dounia would he have to give himself up perhap
to prevent dounia from take some rash step the letter thi morn
dounia had receiv a letter from whom could she get letter in
petersburg luzhin perhap it true razumihin wa there to protect
her but razumihin knew noth of the posit perhap it wa hi duti
to tell razumihin he thought of it with repugn
in ani case he must see svidrigalov as soon as possibl he decid
final thank god the detail of the interview were of littl
consequ if onli he could get at the root of the matter but
if svidrigalov were capabl if he were intrigu against
douniathen
raskolnikov wa so exhaust by what he had pass through that month
that he could onli decid such question in on wai then i shall kill
him he thought in cold despair
a sudden anguish oppress hi heart he stood still in the middl of
the street and began look about to see where he wa and which wai he
wa go he found himself in x prospect thirti or forti pace from
the hai market through which he had come the whole second storei of
the hous on the left wa us as a tavern all the window were wide
open judg from the figur move at the window the room were
full to overflow there were sound of sing of clarionet and
violin and the boom of a turkish drum he could hear women shriek
he wa about to turn back wonder why he had come to the x prospect
when suddenli at on of the end window he saw svidrigalov sit
at a teatabl right in the open window with a pipe in hi mouth
raskolnikov wa dreadfulli taken aback almost terrifi svidrigalov
wa silent watch and scrutinis him and what struck raskolnikov
at onc seem to be mean to get up and slip awai unobserv
raskolnikov at onc pretend not to have seen him but to be look
absentmindedli awai while he watch him out of the corner of hi ey
hi heart wa beat violent yet it wa evid that svidrigalov
did not want to be seen he took the pipe out of hi mouth and wa on
the point of conceal himself but as he got up and move back hi
chair he seem to have becom suddenli awar that raskolnikov had seen
him and wa watch him what had pass between them wa much the
same as what happen at their first meet in raskolnikov room a
sly smile came into svidrigalov face and grew broader and
broader each knew that he wa seen and watch by the other at last
svidrigalov broke into a loud laugh
well well come in if you want me i am here he shout from the
window
raskolnikov went up into the tavern he found svidrigalov in a tini
back room adjoin the saloon in which merchant clerk and number
of peopl of all sort were drink tea at twenti littl tabl to the
desper bawl of a choru of singer the click of billiard ball
could be heard in the distanc on the tabl befor svidrigalov stood
an open bottl and a glass half full of champagn in the room he found
also a boi with a littl hand organ a healthylook redcheek girl
of eighteen wear a tuckedup stripe skirt and a tyroles hat with
ribbon in spite of the choru in the other room she wa sing some
servant hall song in a rather huski contralto to the accompani of
the organ
come that enough svidrigalov stop her at raskolnikov
entranc the girl at onc broke off and stood wait respectfulli
she had sung her guttur rhyme too with a seriou and respect
express in her face
hei philip a glass shout svidrigalov
i wont drink anyth said raskolnikov
as you like i didnt mean it for you drink katia i dont want
anyth more todai you can go he pour her out a full glass and
laid down a yellow note
katia drank off her glass of wine as women do without put it down
in twenti gulp took the note and kiss svidrigalov hand which he
allow quit serious she went out of the room and the boi trail
after her with the organ both had been brought in from the street
svidrigalov had not been a week in petersburg but everyth about him
wa alreadi so to speak on a patriarch foot the waiter philip
wa by now an old friend and veri obsequi
the door lead to the saloon had a lock on it svidrigalov wa at
home in thi room and perhap spent whole dai in it the tavern wa
dirti and wretch not even secondr
i wa go to see you and look for you raskolnikov began but
i dont know what made me turn from the hai market into the x prospect
just now i never take thi turn i turn to the right from the hai
market and thi isnt the wai to you i simpli turn and here you ar
it is strang
why dont you sai at onc it a miracl
becaus it mai be onli chanc
oh that the wai with all you folk laugh svidrigalov you wont
admit it even if you do inwardli believ it a miracl here you sai
that it mai be onli chanc and what coward thei all ar here about
have an opinion of their own you cant fanci rodion romanovitch i
dont mean you you have an opinion of your own and ar not afraid to
have it that how it wa you attract my curios

but onli slightli so he had not had more than half a glass of wine
i fanci you came to see me befor you knew that i wa capabl of have
what you call an opinion of my own observ raskolnikov
oh well it wa a differ matter everyon ha hi own plan and

chapter iv
you know perhapsy i told you myself began svidrigalov that
i wa in the debtor prison here for an immens sum and had not
ani expect of be abl to pai it there no need to go into
particular how marfa petrovna bought me out do you know to what a
point of insan a woman can sometim love she wa an honest woman
and veri sensibl although complet uneduc would you believ
that thi honest and jealou woman after mani scene of hyster and
reproach condescend to enter into a kind of contract with me which
she kept throughout our marri life she wa consider older than
i and besid she alwai kept a clove or someth in her mouth there
wa so much swinish in my soul and honesti too of a sort as to
tell her straight out that i couldnt be absolut faith to her
thi confess drove her to frenzi but yet she seem in a wai to have
like my brutal frank she thought it show i wa unwil to
deceiv her if i warn her like thi beforehand and for a jealou
woman you know that the first consider after mani tear an
unwritten contract wa drawn up between us first that i would never
leav marfa petrovna and would alwai be her husband secondli that i
would never absent myself without her permiss thirdli that i would
never set up a perman mistress fourthli in return for thi marfa
petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidserv but onli with her
secret knowledg fifthli god forbid my fall in love with a woman of
our class sixthli in case iwhich god forbidshould be visit by
a great seriou passion i wa bound to reveal it to marfa petrovna on
thi last score howev marfa petrovna wa fairli at eas she wa a
sensibl woman and so she could not help look upon me as a dissolut
proflig incap of real love but a sensibl woman and a jealou
woman ar two veri differ thing and that where the troubl
came in but to judg some peopl imparti we must renounc certain
preconceiv opinion and our habitu attitud to the ordinari peopl
about us i have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than
in anyon perhap you have alreadi heard a great deal that wa
ridicul and absurd about marfa petrovna she certainli had some veri
ridicul wai but i tell you frankli that i feel realli sorri for the
innumer woe of which i wa the caus well and that enough i
think by wai of a decor oraison funbr for the most tender wife
of a most tender husband when we quarrel i usual held my tongu
and did not irrit her and that gentlemanli conduct rare fail to
attain it object it influenc her it pleas her inde these were
time when she wa posit proud of me but your sister she couldnt
put up with anywai and howev she came to risk take such a
beauti creatur into her hous as a gover my explan is that
marfa petrovna wa an ardent and impression woman and simpli fell
in love herselfliter fell in lovewith your sister well littl
wonderlook at avdotya romanovna i saw the danger at the first glanc
and what do you think i resolv not to look at her even but avdotya
romanovna herself made the first step would you believ it would you
believ it too that marfa petrovna wa posit angri with me at first
for my persist silenc about your sister for my careless recept
of her continu ador prais of avdotya romanovna i dont know
what it wa she want well of cours marfa petrovna told avdotya
romanovna everi detail about me she had the unfortun habit of
tell liter everyon all our famili secret and continu
complain of me how could she fail to confid in such a delight
new friend i expect thei talk of noth els but me and no doubt
avdotya romanovna heard all those dark mysteri rumour that were
current about me i dont mind bet that you too have heard
someth of the sort alreadi
i have luzhin charg you with have caus the death of a child is
that true
dont refer to those vulgar tale i beg said svidrigalov with
disgust and annoy if you insist on want to know about all that
idioci i will tell you on dai but now
i wa told too about some footman of your in the countri whom you
treat badli
i beg you to drop the subject svidrigalov interrupt again with
obviou impati
wa that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe
you told me about it yourself raskolnikov felt more and more
irrit
svidrigalov look at him attent and raskolnikov fanci he caught
a flash of spite mockeri in that look but svidrigalov restrain
himself and answer veri civilli
ye it wa i see that you too ar extrem interest and shall
feel it my duti to satisfi your curios at the first opportun upon
my soul i see that i realli might pass for a romant figur with
some peopl judg how grate i must be to marfa petrovna for have
repeat to avdotya romanovna such mysteri and interest gossip
about me i dare not guess what impress it made on her but in ani
case it work in my interest with all avdotya romanovna natur
avers and in spite of my invari gloomi and repel aspectsh
did at least feel piti for me piti for a lost soul and if onc a
girl heart is move to piti it more danger than anyth she
is bound to want to save him to bring him to hi sens and lift
him up and draw him to nobler aim and restor him to new life and
usefulnesswel we all know how far such dream can go i saw at onc
that the bird wa fly into the cage of herself and i too made readi
i think you ar frown rodion romanovitch there no need as you
know it all end in smoke hang it all what a lot i am drink
do you know i alwai from the veri begin regret that it wasnt
your sister fate to be born in the second or third centuri ad as
the daughter of a reign princ or some governor or proconsul in asia
minor she would undoubtedli have been on of those who would endur
martyrdom and would have smile when thei brand her bosom with hot
pincer and she would have gone to it of herself and in the fourth or
fifth centuri she would have walk awai into the egyptian desert and
would have stai there thirti year live on root and ecstasi and
vision she is simpli thirst to face some tortur for someon and
if she cant get her tortur shell throw herself out of a window iv
heard someth of a mr razumihinh said to be a sensibl fellow
hi surnam suggest it inde he probabl a divin student well
hed better look after your sister i believ i understand her and i am
proud of it but at the begin of an acquaint as you know on
is apt to be more heedless and stupid on doesnt see clearli hang it
all why is she so handsom it not my fault in fact it began on
my side with a most irresist physic desir avdotya romanovna is
awfulli chast incred and phenomen so take note i tell you
thi about your sister as a fact she is almost morbidli chast in
spite of her broad intellig and it will stand in her wai there
happen to be a girl in the hous then parasha a blackei
wench whom i had never seen beforesh had just come from anoth
villageveri pretti but incred stupid she burst into tear
wail so that she could be heard all over the place and caus scandal
on dai after dinner avdotya romanovna follow me into an avenu in
the garden and with flash ey insist on my leav poor parasha
alon it wa almost our first convers by ourselv i of cours
wa onli too pleas to obei her wish tri to appear disconcert
embarrass in fact plai my part not badli then came interview
mysteri convers exhort entreati supplic even
tearswould you believ it even tear think what the passion for
propaganda will bring some girl to i of cours threw it all on
my destini pose as hunger and thirst for light and final
resort to the most power weapon in the subject of the
femal heart a weapon which never fail on it the wellknown
resourceflatteri noth in the world is harder than speak the
truth and noth easier than flatteri if there the hundredth part
of a fals note in speak the truth it lead to a discord and that
lead to troubl but if all to the last note is fals in flatteri it
is just as agreeabl and is heard not without satisfact it mai be
a coars satisfact but still a satisfact and howev coars the
flatteri at least half will be sure to seem true that so for all
stage of develop and class of societi a vestal virgin might be
seduc by flatteri i can never rememb without laughter how i onc
seduc a ladi who wa devot to her husband her children and her
principl what fun it wa and how littl troubl and the ladi realli
had principlesof her own anywai all my tactic lai in simpli be
utterli annihil and prostrat befor her puriti i flatter her
shamelessli and as soon as i succeed in get a pressur of
the hand even a glanc from her i would reproach myself for have
snatch it by forc and would declar that she had resist so that
i could never have gain anyth but for my be so unprincipl
i maintain that she wa so innoc that she could not forese my
treacheri and yield to me unconsci unawar and so on in
fact i triumph while my ladi remain firmli convinc that she wa
innoc chast and faith to all her duti and oblig and
had succumb quit by accid and how angri she wa with me when i
explain to her at last that it wa my sincer convict that she wa
just as eager as i poor marfa petrovna wa awfulli weak on the side of
flatteri and if i had onli care to i might have had all her properti
settl on me dure her lifetim i am drink an aw lot of wine
now and talk too much i hope you wont be angri if i mention now
that i wa begin to produc the same effect on avdotya romanovna
but i wa stupid and impati and spoil it all avdotya romanovna had
sever timesand on time in particularbeen greatli displeas by
the express of my ey would you believ it there wa sometim a
light in them which frighten her and grew stronger and stronger and
more unguard till it wa hate to her no need to go into detail
but we part there i act stupidli again i fell to jeer in the
coarsest wai at all such propaganda and effort to convert me parasha
came on to the scene again and not she alon in fact there wa a
tremend todo ah rodion romanovitch if you could onli see how your
sister ey can flash sometim never mind my be drunk at thi
moment and have had a whole glass of wine i am speak the truth
i assur you that thi glanc ha haunt my dream the veri rustl of
her dress wa more than i could stand at last i realli began to think
that i might becom epilept i could never have believ that i could
be move to such a frenzi it wa essenti inde to be reconcil
but by then it wa imposs and imagin what i did then to what
a pitch of stupid a man can be brought by frenzi never undertak
anyth in a frenzi rodion romanovitch i reflect that avdotya
romanovna wa after all a beggar ach excus me that not the word
but doe it matter if it express the mean that she live by
her work that she had her mother and you to keep ach hang it you
ar frown again and i resolv to offer her all my moneythirti
thousand roubl i could have realis thenif she would run awai with
me here to petersburg of cours i should have vow etern love
raptur and so on do you know i wa so wild about her at that time
that if she had told me to poison marfa petrovna or to cut her throat
and to marri herself it would have been done at onc but it end in
the catastroph of which you know alreadi you can fanci how frantic i
wa when i heard that marfa petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelli
attornei luzhin and had almost made a match between themwhich would
realli have been just the same thing as i wa propos wouldnt it

he ground hi teeth and sank into silenc again again dounia imag

she had lower the revolv in terror and gaze blankli at him so that
he might have seiz her twice over and she would not have lift a hand
to defend herself if he had not remind her he recal how at that

as befor the wind wa howl under the window how disgust he
thought with annoy
he got up and sat on the edg of the bedstead with hi back to the
window it better not to sleep at all he decid there wa a cold
damp draught from the window howev without get up he drew the
blanket over him and wrap himself in it he wa not think of
anyth and did not want to think but on imag rose after anoth
incoher scrap of thought without begin or end pass through hi
mind he sank into drowsi perhap the cold or the damp or
the dark or the wind that howl under the window and toss the tree
rous a sort of persist crave for the fantast he kept dwell
on imag of flower he fanci a charm flower garden a bright
warm almost hot dai a holidaytrin dai a fine sumptuou countri
cottag in the english tast overgrown with fragrant flower with
flower bed go round the hous the porch wreath in climber wa
surround with bed of rose a light cool staircas carpet with
rich rug wa decor with rare plant in china pot he notic
particularli in the window nosegai of tender white heavili fragrant
narcissu bend over their bright green thick long stalk he wa
reluct to move awai from them but he went up the stair and came
into a larg high drawingroom and again everywhereat the window
the door on to the balconi and on the balconi itselfwer flower
the floor were strewn with freshlycut fragrant hai the window
were open a fresh cool light air came into the room the bird were
chirrup under the window and in the middl of the room on a tabl
cover with a white satin shroud stood a coffin the coffin wa
cover with white silk and edg with a thick white frill wreath of
flower surround it on all side among the flower lai a girl in a
white muslin dress with her arm cross and press on her bosom as
though carv out of marbl but her loos fair hair wa wet there wa
a wreath of rose on her head the stern and alreadi rigid profil of
her face look as though chisel of marbl too and the smile on her
pale lip wa full of an immens unchildish miseri and sorrow appeal
svidrigalov knew that girl there wa no holi imag no burn candl
besid the coffin no sound of prayer the girl had drown herself
she wa onli fourteen but her heart wa broken and she had destroi
herself crush by an insult that had appal and amaz that childish
soul had smirch that angel puriti with unmerit disgrac and torn
from her a last scream of despair unheed and brutal disregard on
a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howl
svidrigalov came to himself got up from the bed and went to the
window he felt for the latch and open it the wind lash furious
into the littl room and stung hi face and hi chest onli cover with
hi shirt as though with frost under the window there must have been
someth like a garden and appar a pleasur garden there too
probabl there were teatabl and sing in the daytim now drop of
rain flew in at the window from the tree and bush it wa dark as
in a cellar so that he could onli just make out some dark blur of
object svidrigalov bend down with elbow on the windowsil
gaze for five minut into the dark the boom of a cannon follow
by a second on resound in the dark of the night ah the
signal the river is overflow he thought by morn it will be
swirl down the street in the lower part flood the basement and
cellar the cellar rat will swim out and men will curs in the rain
and wind as thei drag their rubbish to their upper storei what time is
it now and he had hardli thought it when somewher near a clock on
the wall tick awai hurriedli struck three
aha it will be light in an hour why wait ill go out at onc
straight to the park ill choos a great bush there drench with rain
so that as soon as on shoulder touch it million of drop drip on
on head
he move awai from the window shut it light the candl put on hi
waistcoat hi overcoat and hi hat and went out carri the candl
into the passag to look for the rag attend who would be asleep
somewher in the midst of candleend and all sort of rubbish to pai
him for the room and leav the hotel it the best minut i couldnt
choos a better
he walk for some time through a long narrow corridor without find
anyon and wa just go to call out when suddenli in a dark corner
between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strang object
which seem to be aliv he bent down with the candl and saw a littl
girl not more than five year old shiver and cry with her
cloth as wet as a soak houseflannel she did not seem afraid of
svidrigalov but look at him with blank amaz out of her big
black ey now and then she sob as children do when thei have been
cry a long time but ar begin to be comfort the child face
wa pale and tire she wa numb with cold how can she have come here
she must have hidden here and not slept all night he began question
her the child suddenli becom anim chatter awai in her babi
languag someth about mammi and that mammi would beat her and
about some cup that she had bwoken the child chatter on without
stop he could onli guess from what she said that she wa a
neglect child whose mother probabl a drunken cook in the servic
of the hotel whip and frighten her that the child had broken
a cup of her mother and wa so frighten that she had run awai the
even befor had hidden for a long while somewher outsid in the
rain at last had made her wai in here hidden behind the cupboard and
spent the night there cry and trembl from the damp the dark
and the fear that she would be badli beaten for it he took her in hi
arm went back to hi room sat her on the bed and began undress
her the torn shoe which she had on her stockingless feet were as
wet as if thei had been stand in a puddl all night when he had
undress her he put her on the bed cover her up and wrap her in
the blanket from her head downward she fell asleep at onc then he
sank into dreari muse again
what folli to troubl myself he decid suddenli with an oppress
feel of annoy what idioci in vexat he took up the candl
to go and look for the rag attend again and make hast to go awai
damn the child he thought as he open the door but he turn again
to see whether the child wa asleep he rais the blanket carefulli
the child wa sleep soundli she had got warm under the blanket
and her pale cheek were flush but strang to sai that flush seem
brighter and coarser than the rosi cheek of childhood it a flush
of fever thought svidrigalov it wa like the flush from drink as
though she had been given a full glass to drink her crimson lip were
hot and glow but what wa thi he suddenli fanci that her long
black eyelash were quiver as though the lid were open and a
sly crafti ey peep out with an unchildlik wink as though the littl
girl were not asleep but pretend ye it wa so her lip part in
a smile the corner of her mouth quiver as though she were try to
control them but now she quit gave up all effort now it wa a grin
a broad grin there wa someth shameless provoc in that quit
unchildish face it wa deprav it wa the face of a harlot the
shameless face of a french harlot now both ey open wide thei
turn a glow shameless glanc upon him thei laugh invit
him there wa someth infinit hideou and shock in that
laugh in those ey in such nasti in the face of a child what
at five year old svidrigalov mutter in genuin horror what doe
it mean and now she turn to him her littl face all aglow hold
out her arm accurs child svidrigalov cri rais hi hand
to strike her but at that moment he woke up

fli woke up and settl on the untouch veal which wa still on
the tabl he stare at them and at last with hi free right hand began
try to catch on he tri till he wa tire but could not catch it
at last realis that he wa engag in thi interest pursuit he
start got up and walk resolut out of the room a minut later he
wa in the street

slipperi dirti wooden pavement toward the littl neva he wa pictur
the water of the littl neva swollen in the night petrovski island
the wet path the wet grass the wet tree and bush and at last the
bush he began illhumouredli stare at the hous try to think
of someth els there wa not a cabman or a passerbi in the street

thoughtfulli to her heart i confid much of what ha sinc been so
hideous realis dont be uneasi he return to dounia she wa
as much oppos to it as you and i am glad that she is gone the great
point is that everyth now is go to be differ is go to
be broken in two he cri suddenli return to hi deject
everyth everyth and am i prepar for it do i want it myself
thei sai it is necessari for me to suffer what the object of these
senseless suffer shall i know ani better what thei ar for when i
am crush by hardship and idioci and weak as an old man after twenti
year penal servitud and what shall i have to live for then why am i
consent to that life now oh i knew i wa contempt when i stood

moment later of hi angri gestur to dounia but why ar thei so fond
of me if i dont deserv it oh if onli i were alon and no on love

be humbl befor all of them indiscriminatelyhumbl by convict
and yet why not it must be so would not twenti year of continu
bondag crush him utterli water wear out a stone and why why should
he live after that why should he go now when he knew that it would be
so it wa the hundredth time perhap that he had ask himself that
question sinc the previou even but still he went

siberia on the bank of a broad solitari river stand a town on of
the administr centr of russia in the town there is a fortress
in the fortress there is a prison in the prison the secondclass
convict rodion raskolnikov ha been confin for nine month almost a
year and a half ha pass sinc hi crime
there had been littl difficulti about hi trial the crimin adher
exactli firmli and clearli to hi statement he did not confus nor
misrepres the fact nor soften them in hi own interest nor omit
the smallest detail he explain everi incid of the murder the
secret of the pledg the piec of wood with a strip of metal which
wa found in the murder woman hand he describ minut how he
had taken her kei what thei were like as well as the chest and it
content he explain the mysteri of lizaveta murder describ how
koch and after him the student knock and repeat all thei had said
to on anoth how he afterward had run downstair and heard nikolai
and dmitri shout how he had hidden in the empti flat and afterward
gone home he end by indic the stone in the yard off the
voznesenski prospect under which the purs and the trinket were found
the whole thing in fact wa perfectli clear the lawyer and the
judg were veri much struck among other thing by the fact that he
had hidden the trinket and the purs under a stone without make
us of them and that what wa more he did not now rememb what the
trinket were like or even how mani there were the fact that he had
never open the purs and did not even know how much wa in it seem
incred there turn out to be in the purs three hundr and
seventeen roubl and sixti copeck from be so long under the stone
some of the most valuabl note ly uppermost had suffer from the
damp thei were a long while try to discov why the accus man
should tell a lie about thi when about everyth els he had made
a truth and straightforward confess final some of the lawyer
more vers in psycholog admit that it wa possibl he had realli
not look into the purs and so didnt know what wa in it when he
hid it under the stone but thei immedi drew the deduct that
the crime could onli have been commit through temporari mental
derang through homicid mania without object or the pursuit of
gain thi fell in with the most recent fashion theori of temporari
insan so often appli in our dai in crimin case moreov
raskolnikov hypochondriac condit wa prove by mani wit by
dr zossimov hi former fellow student hi landladi and her servant
all thi point strongli to the conclus that raskolnikov wa not
quit like an ordinari murder and robber but that there wa anoth
element in the case
to the intens annoy of those who maintain thi opinion the
crimin scarc attempt to defend himself to the decis question
as to what motiv impel him to the murder and the robberi he
answer veri clearli with the coarsest frank that the caus wa
hi miser posit hi poverti and helpless and hi desir to
provid for hi first step in life by the help of the three thousand
roubl he had reckon on find he had been led to the murder
through hi shallow and cowardli natur exasper moreov by
privat and failur to the question what led him to confess he
answer that it wa hi heartfelt repent all thi wa almost
coars
the sentenc howev wa more merci than could have been expect
perhap partli becaus the crimin had not tri to justifi himself
but had rather shown a desir to exagger hi guilt all the strang
and peculiar circumst of the crime were taken into consider
there could be no doubt of the abnorm and povertystricken condit
of the crimin at the time the fact that he had made no us of what he
had stolen wa put down partli to the effect of remors partli to hi
abnorm mental condit at the time of the crime incident the
murder of lizaveta serv inde to confirm the last hypothesi a man
commit two murder and forget that the door is open final the
confess at the veri moment when the case wa hopelessli muddl by
the fals evid given by nikolai through melancholi and fanatic
and when moreov there were no proof against the real crimin no
suspicion even porfiri petrovitch fulli kept hi wordal thi did
much to soften the sentenc other circumst too in the prison
favour came out quit unexpectedli razumihin somehow discov and
prove that while raskolnikov wa at the univers he had help a poor
consumpt fellow student and had spent hi last penni on support
him for six month and when thi student di leav a decrepit
old father whom he had maintain almost from hi thirteenth year
raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospit and paid for hi funer
when he di raskolnikov landladi bore wit too that when thei
had live in anoth hous at five corner raskolnikov had rescu two
littl children from a hous on fire and wa burnt in do so thi wa
investig and fairli well confirm by mani wit these fact
made an impress in hi favour
and in the end the crimin wa in consider of extenu
circumst condemn to penal servitud in the second class for a
term of eight year onli
at the veri begin of the trial raskolnikov mother fell ill dounia
and razumihin found it possibl to get her out of petersburg dure the
trial razumihin chose a town on the railwai not far from petersburg so
as to be abl to follow everi step of the trial and at the same time
to see avdotya romanovna as often as possibl pulcheria alexandrovna
ill wa a strang nervou on and wa accompani by a partial
derang of her intellect
when dounia return from her last interview with her brother she
had found her mother alreadi ill in feverish delirium that even
razumihin and she agre what answer thei must make to her mother
question about raskolnikov and made up a complet stori for her
mother benefit of hi have to go awai to a distant part of russia
on a busi commiss which would bring him in the end monei and
reput
but thei were struck by the fact that pulcheria alexandrovna never
ask them anyth on the subject neither then nor thereaft on the
contrari she had her own version of her son sudden departur she
told them with tear how he had come to sai goodby to her hint
that she alon knew mani mysteri and import fact and that rodya
had mani veri power enemi so that it wa necessari for him to be
in hide as for hi futur career she had no doubt that it would be
brilliant when certain sinist influenc could be remov she assur
razumihin that her son would be on dai a great statesman that hi
articl and brilliant literari talent prove it thi articl she wa
continu read she even read it aloud almost took it to bed
with her but scarc ask where rodya wa though the subject wa
obvious avoid by the other which might have been enough to awaken
her suspicion
thei began to be frighten at last at pulcheria alexandrovna strang
silenc on certain subject she did not for instanc complain of
get no letter from him though in previou year she had onli live
on the hope of letter from her belov rodya thi wa the caus of
great uneasi to dounia the idea occur to her that her mother
suspect that there wa someth terribl in her son fate and wa
afraid to ask for fear of hear someth still more aw in ani
case dounia saw clearli that her mother wa not in full possess of
her faculti
it happen onc or twice howev that pulcheria alexandrovna gave
such a turn to the convers that it wa imposs to answer her
without mention where rodya wa and on receiv unsatisfactori and
suspici answer she becam at onc gloomi and silent and thi mood
last for a long time dounia saw at last that it wa hard to deceiv
her and came to the conclus that it wa better to be absolut
silent on certain point but it becam more and more evid that
the poor mother suspect someth terribl dounia rememb her
brother tell her that her mother had overheard her talk in her
sleep on the night after her interview with svidrigalov and befor the
fatal dai of the confess had not she made out someth from that
sometim dai and even week of gloomi silenc and tear would be

raskolnikov had been veri dreami for a few dai befor he ask a great
deal about hi mother and wa constantli anxiou about her he worri
so much about her that it alarm dounia when he heard about hi

reserv all the time with the help of the monei left to her by
svidrigalov sonia had long ago made her prepar to follow the
parti of convict in which he wa despatch to siberia not a word

sister and razumihin fervent anticip of their happi futur
togeth when he should come out of prison he predict that their
mother ill would soon have a fatal end sonia and he at last
set off
two month later dounia wa marri to razumihin it wa a quiet and
sorrow wed porfiri petrovitch and zossimov were invit howev
dure all thi period razumihin wore an air of resolut determin
dounia put implicit faith in hi carri out hi plan and inde she
could not but believ in him he displai a rare strength of will
among other thing he began attend univers lectur again in order
to take hi degre thei were continu make plan for the futur

melancholi and anxiou to give her pleasur razumihin told her how
raskolnikov had look after the poor student and hi decrepit father
and how a year ago he had been burnt and injur in rescu two
littl children from a fire these two piec of new excit pulcheria

continu talk about them even enter into convers with
stranger in the street though dounia alwai accompani her in public
convey and shop wherev she could captur a listen she would
begin the discours about her son hi articl how he had help the
student how he had been burnt at the fire and so on dounia did
not know how to restrain her apart from the danger of her morbid
excit there wa the risk of someon recal raskolnikov name
and speak of the recent trial pulcheria alexandrovna found out the
address of the mother of the two children her son had save and insist
on go to see her
at last her restless reach an extrem point she would sometim
begin to cry suddenli and wa often ill and feverishli deliri on
morn she declar that by her reckon rodya ought soon to be home
that she rememb when he said goodby to her he said that thei must
expect him back in nine month she began to prepar for hi come

put up new hang and so on dounia wa anxiou but said noth and
help her to arrang the room after a fatigu dai spent in continu
fanci in joy daydream and tear pulcheria alexandrovna wa
taken ill in the night and by morn she wa feverish and deliri
it wa brain fever she di within a fortnight in her delirium she
drop word which show that she knew a great deal more about her
son terribl fate than thei had suppos
for a long time raskolnikov did not know of hi mother death though
a regular correspond had been maintain from the time he reach
siberia it wa carri on by mean of sonia who wrote everi month
to the razumihin and receiv an answer with unfail regular at
first thei found sonia letter dry and unsatisfactori but later on
thei came to the conclus that the letter could not be better for
from these letter thei receiv a complet pictur of their unfortun
brother life sonia letter were full of the most matteroffact
detail the simplest and clearest descript of all raskolnikov
surround as a convict there wa no word of her own hope no
conjectur as to the futur no descript of her feel instead of
ani attempt to interpret hi state of mind and inner life she gave the
simpl factsthat is hi own word an exact account of hi health
what he ask for at their interview what commiss he gave her
and so on all these fact she gave with extraordinari minut the
pictur of their unhappi brother stood out at last with great clear
and precis there could be no mistak becaus noth wa given but
fact
but dounia and her husband could get littl comfort out of the new
especi at first sonia wrote that he wa constantli sullen and not
readi to talk that he scarc seem interest in the new she gave
him from their letter that he sometim ask after hi mother and
that when see that he had guess the truth she told him at last
of her death she wa surpris to find that he did not seem greatli
affect by it not extern at ani rate she told them that although
he seem so wrap up in himself and as it were shut himself off
from everyoneh took a veri direct and simpl view of hi new life
that he understood hi posit expect noth better for the time
had no illfound hope as is so common in hi posit and scarc
seem surpris at anyth in hi surround so unlik anyth he
had known befor she wrote that hi health wa satisfactori he did hi
work without shirk or seek to do more he wa almost indiffer
about food but except on sundai and holidai the food wa so bad that
at last he had been glad to accept some monei from her sonia to have
hi own tea everi dai he beg her not to troubl about anyth els
declar that all thi fuss about him onli annoi him sonia wrote
further that in prison he share the same room with the rest that she
had not seen the insid of their barrack but conclud that thei were
crowd miser and unhealthi that he slept on a plank bed with a
rug under him and wa unwil to make ani other arrang but that
he live so poorli and roughli not from ani plan or design but simpli
from inattent and indiffer
sonia wrote simpli that he had at first shown no interest in her visit
had almost been vex with her inde for come unwil to talk and
rude to her but that in the end these visit had becom a habit and
almost a necess for him so that he wa posit distress when
she wa ill for some dai and could not visit him she us to see him
on holidai at the prison gate or in the guardroom to which he wa
brought for a few minut to see her on work dai she would go to
see him at work either at the workshop or at the brick kiln or at the
shed on the bank of the irtish
about herself sonia wrote that she had succeed in make some
acquaint in the town that she did sew and as there
wa scarc a dressmak in the town she wa look upon as an
indispens person in mani hous but she did not mention that the
author were through her interest in raskolnikov that hi task
wa lighten and so on
at last the new came dounia had inde notic sign of alarm and
uneasi in the preced letter that he held aloof from everyon
that hi fellow prison did not like him that he kept silent for dai
at a time and wa becom veri pale in the last letter sonia wrote
that he had been taken veri serious ill and wa in the convict ward of
the hospit
ii
he wa ill a long time but it wa not the horror of prison life not
the hard labour the bad food the shaven head or the patch cloth
that crush him what did he care for all those trial and hardship
he wa even glad of the hard work physic exhaust he could at
least reckon on a few hour of quiet sleep and what wa the food to
himth thin cabbag soup with beetl float in it in the past as a
student he had often not had even that hi cloth were warm and suit
to hi manner of life he did not even feel the fetter wa he asham
of hi shaven head and particolour coat befor whom befor sonia
sonia wa afraid of him how could he be asham befor her and yet he
wa asham even befor sonia whom he tortur becaus of it with
hi contemptu rough manner but it wa not hi shaven head and hi
fetter he wa asham of hi pride had been stung to the quick it wa
wound pride that made him ill oh how happi he would have been if he
could have blame himself he could have born anyth then even
shame and disgrac but he judg himself sever and hi exasper
conscienc found no particularli terribl fault in hi past except
a simpl blunder which might happen to anyon he wa asham just
becaus he raskolnikov had so hopelessli stupidli come to grief
through some decre of blind fate and must humbl himself and submit to
the idioci of a sentenc if he were anyhow to be at peac
vagu and objectless anxieti in the present and in the futur a
continu sacrific lead to nothingthat wa all that lai befor
him and what comfort wa it to him that at the end of eight year he
would onli be thirtytwo and abl to begin a new life what had he to
live for what had he to look forward to why should he strive to live
in order to exist why he had been readi a thousand time befor to
give up exist for the sake of an idea for a hope even for a fanci
mere exist had alwai been too littl for him he had alwai want
more perhap it wa just becaus of the strength of hi desir that he
had thought himself a man to whom more wa permiss than to other
and if onli fate would have sent him repentanceburn repent that
would have torn hi heart and rob him of sleep that repent the
aw agoni of which bring vision of hang or drown oh he would
have been glad of it tear and agoni would at least have been life
but he did not repent of hi crime
at least he might have found relief in rage at hi stupid as he
had rage at the grotesqu blunder that had brought him to prison
but now in prison in freedom he thought over and criticis all hi
action again and by no mean found them so blunder and so grotesqu
as thei had seem at the fatal time
in what wai he ask himself wa my theori stupid than other
that have swarm and clash from the begin of the world on ha
onli to look at the thing quit independ broadli and uninfluenc
by commonplac idea and my idea will by no mean seem so strang
oh sceptic and halfpenni philosoph why do you halt halfwai
why doe my action strike them as so horribl he said to himself is
it becaus it wa a crime what is meant by crime my conscienc is at
rest of cours it wa a legal crime of cours the letter of the law
wa broken and blood wa shed well punish me for the letter of the
law and that enough of cours in that case mani of the
benefactor of mankind who snatch power for themselv instead of
inherit it ought to have been punish at their first step but
those men succeed and so thei were right and i didnt and so i
had no right to have taken that step
it wa onli in that that he recognis hi crimin onli in the fact
that he had been unsuccess and had confess it
he suffer too from the question why had he not kill himself why
had he stood look at the river and prefer to confess wa the
desir to live so strong and wa it so hard to overcom it had not
svidrigalov overcom it although he wa afraid of death
in miseri he ask himself thi question and could not understand that
at the veri time he had been stand look into the river he had
perhap been dimli consciou of the fundament falsiti in himself and
hi convict he didnt understand that that conscious might be
the promis of a futur crisi of a new view of life and of hi futur
resurrect
he prefer to attribut it to the dead weight of instinct which he
could not step over again through weak and mean he look at
hi fellow prison and wa amaz to see how thei all love life and
prize it it seem to him that thei love and valu life more in
prison than in freedom what terribl agoni and privat some of
them the tramp for instanc had endur could thei care so much for
a rai of sunshin for the primev forest the cold spring hidden awai
in some unseen spot which the tramp had mark three year befor and
long to see again as he might to see hi sweetheart dream of the
green grass round it and the bird sing in the bush as he went on he
saw still more inexplic exampl
in prison of cours there wa a great deal he did not see and did not
want to see he live as it were with downcast ey it wa loathsom
and unbear for him to look but in the end there wa much that
surpris him and he began as it were involuntarili to notic much
that he had not suspect befor what surpris him most of all wa
the terribl imposs gulf that lai between him and all the rest thei
seem to be a differ speci and he look at them and thei at
him with distrust and hostil he felt and knew the reason of hi
isol but he would never have admit till then that those reason
were so deep and strong there were some polish exil polit
prison among them thei simpli look down upon all the rest as
ignor churl but raskolnikov could not look upon them like that
he saw that these ignor men were in mani respect far wiser than the
pole there were some russian who were just as contemptu a former
offic and two seminarist raskolnikov saw their mistak as clearli
he wa dislik and avoid by everyon thei even began to hate him at
lastwhi he could not tell men who had been far more guilti despis
and laugh at hi crime
your a gentleman thei us to sai you shouldnt hack about with
an ax that not a gentleman work
the second week in lent hi turn came to take the sacrament with hi
gang he went to church and prai with the other a quarrel broke out
on dai he did not know how all fell on him at onc in a furi
your an infidel you dont believ in god thei shout you ought
to be kill
he had never talk to them about god nor hi belief but thei want to
kill him as an infidel he said noth on of the prison rush at
him in a perfect frenzi raskolnikov await him calmli and silent
hi eyebrow did not quiver hi face did not flinch the guard
succeed in interven between him and hi assail or there would
have been bloodsh
there wa anoth question he could not decid why were thei all so
fond of sonia she did not try to win their favour she rare met
them sometim onli she came to see him at work for a moment and yet
everybodi knew her thei knew that she had come out to follow him
knew how and where she live she never gave them monei did them no
particular servic onli onc at christma she sent them all present
of pi and roll but by degre closer relat sprang up between
them and sonia she would write and post letter for them to their
relat relat of the prison who visit the town at their
instruct left with sonia present and monei for them their wive
and sweetheart knew her and us to visit her and when she visit
raskolnikov at work or met a parti of the prison on the road thei
all took off their hat to her littl mother sofya semyonovna you
ar our dear good littl mother coars brand crimin said to that
frail littl creatur she would smile and bow to them and everyon wa
delight when she smile thei even admir her gait and turn round
to watch her walk thei admir her too for be so littl and in
fact did not know what to admir her most for thei even came to her
for help in their ill
he wa in the hospit from the middl of lent till after easter when
he wa better he rememb the dream he had had while he wa feverish
and deliri he dreamt that the whole world wa condemn to a
terribl new strang plagu that had come to europ from the depth of
asia all were to be destroi except a veri few chosen some new sort
of microb were attack the bodi of men but these microb were
endow with intellig and will men attack by them becam at onc
mad and furiou but never had men consid themselv so intellectu
and so complet in possess of the truth as these suffer never
had thei consid their decis their scientif conclus their
moral convict so infal whole villag whole town and peopl
went mad from the infect all were excit and did not understand
on anoth each thought that he alon had the truth and wa wretch
look at the other beat himself on the breast wept and wrung
hi hand thei did not know how to judg and could not agre what to
consid evil and what good thei did not know whom to blame whom
to justifi men kill each other in a sort of senseless spite thei
gather togeth in armi against on anoth but even on the march
the armi would begin attack each other the rank would be broken
and the soldier would fall on each other stab and cut bite
and devour each other the alarm bell wa ring all dai long in
the town men rush togeth but why thei were summon and who wa
summon them no on knew the most ordinari trade were abandon
becaus everyon propos hi own idea hi own improv and thei
could not agre the land too wa abandon men met in group agre
on someth swore to keep togeth but at onc began on someth
quit differ from what thei had propos thei accus on anoth
fought and kill each other there were conflagr and famin all
men and all thing were involv in destruct the plagu spread and
move further and further onli a few men could be save in the whole
world thei were a pure chosen peopl destin to found a new race and
a new life to renew and purifi the earth but no on had seen these
men no on had heard their word and their voic

distanc at the hospit gate she seem to be wait for someon
someth stab him to the heart at that minut he shudder and
move awai from the window next dai sonia did not come nor the dai
after he notic that he wa expect her uneasili at last he wa
