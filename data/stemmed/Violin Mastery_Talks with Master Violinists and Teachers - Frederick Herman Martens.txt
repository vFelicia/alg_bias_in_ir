violin masteri
eugn ysay
the tool of violin masteri
who is there among contemporari master of the violin whose name stand
for more at the present time than that of the great belgian artist hi
extraordinari temperament power as an interpret enhanc by a
hundr and on special gift of tone and technic gift often allud
to by hi admir colleagu for ysay is the greatest expon of
that wonder belgian school of violin plai which is root in hi
teacher vieuxtemp and wieniawski and which as ysay himself sai
dure a period cover seventi year reign suprem at the
conservatoir in pari in the person of massart remi marsick and
other of it great interpret
what most impress on who meet ysay and talk with him for the
first time is the mental breadth and vision of the man hi kind and
amiabl hi utter lack of small vaniti when the writer first call
on him in new york with a note of introductio from hi friend and
admir adolfo betti and later at scarsdal where in compani with hi
friend thibaud he wa divid hi time between music and tenni ysay
made him entir at home and willingli talk of hi art and it
ideal in repli to some question anent hi own studi year he said
strang to sai my father wa my veri first teacherit is not often
the case i studi with him until i went to the lige conservatori in
1867 where i won a second prize share it with ovid musin for
plai viotti 22d concerto then i had lesson from wieniawski in
brussel and studi two year with vieuxtemp in pari vieuxtemp wa
a paralyt when i came to him yet a wonder teacher though he could
no longer plai and i wa alreadi a concert artist when i met him
he wa a veri great man the grandeur of whose tradit live in the
whole romant school of violin plai look at hi seven
concertosof cours thei ar written with an ey to effect from the
virtuoso standpoint yet how firmli and solidli thei ar built up
how interest is their workingout and the orchestr score is far
more than a mere accompani as regard virtuos effect onli
paganini music compar with hi and paganini of cours did not
plai it as it is now plai in wealth of technic develop in true
music express vieuxtemp is a master a proof is the fact that
hi work have endur forti to fifti year a long life for
composit
joachim lonard sivori wieniawskial admir vieuxtemp in
paganini and locatelli work the effect compar speak
li in the mechan but vieuxtemp is the great artist who made the
instrument take the road of romantic which hugo balzac and gauthier
trod in literatur and befor all the violin wa made to charm to
move and vieuxtemp knew it like rubinstein he held that the artist
must first of all have idea emot powerhi technic must be so
perfect that he doe not have to think of it incident speak
of school of violin plai i find that there is a great tendenc to
confus the belgian and french thi should not be thei ar distinct
though the latter ha undoubtedli been form and influenc by the
former mani of the great violin name in factvieuxtemp lonard
marsick remi parent de broux musin thomsonar all belgian
transcrib note origin text read leonard
ysay repertori
ysay spoke of vieuxtempss repertoryonli he did not call it that he
spoke of the vieuxtemp composit and of vieuxtemp himself
vieuxtemp wrote in the grand style hi music is alwai rich and
sonor if hi violin is realli to sound the violinist must plai
vieuxtemp just as the cellist plai servai you know in the
cathol church at vesper whenev god name is spoken we bow the
head and wieniawski would alwai bow hi head when he said vieuxtemp
is the master of us all
i have often plai hi fifth concerto so warm brilliant and
replet with tempera alwai fullsound rich in an almost
unbound strength of cours sinc vieuxtemp wrote hi concerto a
great varieti of fine modern work ha appear the appreci of
chambermus ha grown and develop and with it that of the sonata
and the modern violin sonata is also a vehicl for violin virtuos in
the veri best mean of the word the sonata of csar franck dindi
thodor duboi lekeu viern ropartz lazarrithei ar all highli
express yet at the same time virtuos the violin part develop a
love song line yet their technic is far from simpl take lekeu
splendid sonata in g major rug and massiv make decid technic
demandsit yet ha a wonder breadth of melodi a great express
qualiti of song
these worksthos who have heard the master plai the beauti lazarri
sonata thi season will not soon forget itar all dedic to ysay
and thi hold good too of the csar franck sonata as ysay sai
perform of these great sonata call for two artistsfor their
piano part ar sometim veri elabor csar franck sent me hi
sonata on septemb 26 1886 my wed dayit wa hi wed
present i cannot complain as regard the number of work realli
import work inscrib to me there ar so manybi chausson hi
symphoni ropartz duboi hi sonataon of the best after franck
dindi the istar variat and other work gabriel faur the
quintet debussi the quartet there ar more than i can recal at
the momentviolin sonata symphon music chambermus choral
work composit of everi kind
debussi as you know wrote practic noth origin for the
violin and pianowith the except perhap of a work publish by
durand dure hi last ill yet he came veri near write someth
for me fifteen year ago he told me he wa compos a nocturn for
me i went off on a concert tour and wa awai a long time when i
return to pari i wrote to debussi to find out what had becom of my
nocturn and he repli that somehow it had shape itself up for
orchestra instead of a violin solo it is on of the troi nocturn
for orchestra perhap on reason why so much ha been inscrib to me
is the fact that as an interpret artist i have never cultiv a
specialti i have plai everyth from bach to debussi for real art
should be intern
ysay himself ha an almost marvel rightarm and fingerboard control
which enabl him to produc at will the finest and most subtl tonal
nuanc in all bow then too he overcom the most intric
mechan problem with seemingli effortless eas and hi tone ha
well been call golden hi own definit of tone is worth
record he sai it should be in music what the heart suggest and
the soul express
the tool of violin masteri
with regard to mechan ysay continu at the present dai the
tool of violin masteri of express technic mechan ar far more
necessari than in dai gone by in fact thei ar indispens if the
spirit is to express itself without restraint and the greater
mechan command on ha the less notic it becom all that
suggest effort awkward difficulti repel the listen who more
than anyth els delight in a sing violin tone vieuxtemp often
said pa de trait pour le traitchantez chantez not run for the
sake of runss sing
too mani of the technician of the present dai no longer sing their
difficultiesthei surmount them more or less happili but the effect is
too appar and though at time the listen mai be astonish he
can never be charm agil finger sure of themselv and a perfect
bow stroke ar essenti and thei must be suprem abl to carri
along the rhythm and poetic action the artist desir mechan
becom if anyth more access in proport as it domain is
enrich by new formula the violinist of todai command far greater
technic resourc than did hi predecessor paganini is access to
nearli all player vieuxtemp no longer offer the difficulti he did
thirti year ago yet the woodwind brass and even the string
instrument subsist in a measur on the heritag transmit by the
master of the past i often feel that violin teach todai endeavor
to develop the esthet sens at too earli a stage and in devot
itself to the head it forget the hand with the result that the
young soldier of the violinist armi full of ardor and courag ar
ill equip for the great battl of art
in thi connect there exist an excel set of tudescapric
by e chaumont which offer the advanc student new element and
formula of develop though in some of them the frame is too larg
for the pictur and though difficult from a violinist point of view
thei lie admir well up the neck to us on of vieuxtempss
express and i take pleasur in call attent to them
when i said that the string instrument includ the violin subsist
in a measur on the heritag transmit by the master of the past i
spoke with special regard to technic sinc vieuxtemp there ha been
hardli on new passag written for the violin and thi ha retard the
develop of it technic in the case of the piano men like godowski
have creat a new technic for their instrument but although
saintsan bruch lalo and other have in their work endow the
violin with much beauti music music itself wa their first concern
and not music for the violin there ar no more concerto written for
the solo flute trombon etca a result there is no new technic
materi ad to the resourc of these instrument
in a wai the same hold good of the violinnew work conceiv onli
from the music point of view bring about the stagnat of technic
discoveri the invent of new passag of novel harmon wealth of
combin is not encourag and a violinist ow it to himself to
exploit the great possibl of hi own instrument i have tri to
find new technic wai and mean of express in my own composit
for exampl i have written a diverti for violin and orchestra in
which i believ i have embodi new thought and idea and have
attempt to give violin technic a broader scope of life and vigor
in the dai of viotti and rode the harmon possibl were more
limitedthei had onli a few chord and hardli ani chord of the ninth
but now harmon materi for the develop of a new violin technic is
there i have some violin studi in ms which i mai publish some dai
devot to that end i am alwai somewhat hesit about
publishingther ar mani thing i might publish but i have seen so
much brought out that wa banal poor unworthi that i have alwai been
inclin to mistrust the valu of my own creation rather than fall into
the same error we have the scale of debussi and hi successor to draw
upon their new chord and success of fourth and fifthsfor new
technic formula ar alwai evolv out of and follow after new
harmon discoveriesthough there is as yet no violin method which
give a finger for the wholeton scale perhap we will have to wait
until kreisler or i will have written on which make plain the new
flower of technic beauti and esthet develop which it bring
the violin
as to teach violin i have never taught violin in the gener
accept sens of the phrase but at godinn where i usual spent my
summer when in europ i gave a kind of tradit cours in the work
of vieuxtemp wieniawski and other master to some forti or fifti
artiststud who would gather thereth same cours i look forward
to give in cincinnati to a master class of veri advanc pupil thi
wa and will be a labor of love for the composit of vieuxtemp and
wieniawski especi ar so inspir and yet as a rule thei ar so
badli playedwithout grandeur or beauti with no thought of the
tradit interpretationthat thei seem the piecework of technic
factori
violin masteri
when i take the whole histori of the violin into account i feel that
the true inward of violin masteri is best express by a kind of
threefold group of great artist first in the order of romant
express we have a triniti made up of corelli viotti and vieuxtemp
then there is a triniti of mechan perfect compos of locatelli
tartini and paganini or a more modern equival csar thomson
kubelik and burmeist and final what i might call in the order of
lyric express a quartet compris ysay thibaud mischa elman and
sametini of chicago the lastnam a wonderfulli fine artist of the
lyric or sing type of cours there ar qualif to be made
locatelli wa not altogeth an expon of technic and mani other fine
artist besid those mention share the characterist of those in
the variou group yet speak in a gener wai i believ that these
group of attain might be said to sum up what violin masteri
realli is and a violin master he must be a violinist a thinker a
poet a human be he must have known hope love passion and despair
he must have run the gamut of the emot in order to express them all
in hi plai he must plai hi violin as pan plai hi flute
in conclus ysay sound a note of warn for the too ambiti
young student and player if art is to progress the technic and
mechan element must not of cours be neglect but a boi of
eighteen cannot expect to express that to which the seriou student of
thirti the man who ha actual live can give voic if the
violinist art is truli a great art it cannot come to fruition in the
artist teen hi accomplish then is no more than a promisea
promis which find it realiz in and by life itself yet american
have the brain as well as the spiritu endow necessari to
understand and appreci beauti in a high degre thei can alreadi
point with pride to violinist who emphat deserv to be call
artist and anoth quartercenturi of artist strive mai well bring
them into the front rank of violinist achiev

leopold auer
a method without secret
when that celebr laboratori of bud music geniu the petrograd
conservatori close it door indefinit ow to the disturb
polit condit of russia the famou violinist and teacher
professor leopold auer decid to pai the visit to the unit state
which had so repeatedli been urg on him by hi friend and pupil hi
fame ow to such herald as efrem zimbalist mischa elman kathleen
parlow eddi brown franci macmillan and more recent sascha heifetz
toscha seidel and max rosen had long sinc preced him and the
recept accord him in thi countri as a soloist and on of the
greatest expon and teacher of hi instrument ha been on justli
due to hi author and premin
it wa not easi to have a hearttoheart talk with the master anent hi
art sinc everi minut of hi time wa preciou yet usher into
hi presenc the writer discov that he had laid asid for the
moment other preoccup and wa amiabl respons to all
question onc their object had been disclos natur the first
and burn question in the case of so celebr a pedagogu wa how
do you form such wonder artist what is the secret of your method
illustr leopold auer with handwritten note
a method without secret
i know said professor auer that there is a theori somewhat to the
effect that i make a few magic pass with the bow by wai of
illustr andprestoy have a zimbalist or a heifetz but the
truth is i have no methodunless you want to call pure natur line
of develop base on natur principl a methodand so of
cours there is no secret about my teach the on great point i lai
stress on in teach is never to kill the individu of my variou
pupil each pupil ha hi own inborn aptitud hi own person
qualiti as regard tone and interpret i alwai have made an
individu studi of each pupil and given each pupil individu
treatment and alwai alwai i have encourag them to develop freeli
in their own wai as regard inspir and ideal so long as thi wa
not contrari to esthet principl and those of my art my idea ha
alwai been to help bring out what natur ha alreadi given rather than
to us dogma to forc a student natur inclin into channel i
myself might prefer and anoth great principl in my teach on
which is product of result is to demand as much as possibl of the
pupil then he will give you someth
of cours the whole subject of violin teach is on that i look at
from the standpoint of the teacher who tri to make what is alreadi
excel perfect from the music and artist standpoint i insist on
a perfect technic develop in everi pupil who come to me art
begin where technic end there can be no real art develop befor
on technic is firmli establish and a great deal of technic work
ha to be done befor the great work of violin literatur the sonata
and concerto mai be approach in petrograd my own assist who
were familiar with my idea prepar my pupil for me and in my own
experi i have found that on cannot teach by word by the spoken
explan alon if i have a point to make i explain it but if my
explan fail to explain i take my violin and bow and clear up the
matter beyond ani doubt the word live it is true but often the word
must be materi by action so that it mean is clear there ar
alwai thing which the pupil must be shown liter though
explan should alwai supplement illustr i studi with
joachim as a boi of sixteenit wa befor 1866 when there wa still a
kingdom of hanov in existenceand joachim alwai illustr hi
mean with bow and fiddl but he never explain the technic side
of what he illustr those more advanc understood without verbal
comment yet there were some who did not
as regard the theori that you can tell who a violinist teacher is by
the wai in which he plai i do not believ in it i do not believ that
you can tell an auer pupil by the manner in which he plai and i am
proud of it sinc it show that my pupil have profit by my
encourag of individu develop and that thei becom genuin
artist each with a person of hi own instead of violinist
automat all bear a mark famili resembl
question as to how hi variou pupil reflect differ phase of
hi teach ideal professor auer mention that he had long sinc
given over pass final decis on hi pupil i could express no
such opinion without unconsci impli comparison and so few
comparison realli compar then too mine would be mere an
individu opinion therefor as ha been my custom for year i will
continu to leav ani ultim decis regard my pupil plai to
the public and the press
hour of practic
how long should the advanc pupil practic professor auer wa ask
the right kind of practic is not a matter of hour he repli
practic should repres the utmost concentr of brain it is
better to plai with concentr for two hour than to practic eight
without i should sai that four hour would be a good maximum practic
timei never ask more of my pupilsand that dure each minut of the
time the brain be as activ as the finger
nation versu the conservatori system
i think there is more valu in the idea of a nation conservatori than
in the idea of nation as regard violin plai no matter what hi
birthplac there is onli on wai in which a student can becom an
artistand that is to have a teacher who can teach in europ the best
teacher ar to be found in the great nation conservatori thibaud
ysayeartist of the highest typear product of the conservatori
system with it splendid teacher so is kreisler on of the greatest
artist who studi in vienna and pari eddi brown the brilliant
american violinist finish at the budapest conservatori in the pari
conservatori the number of pupil in a class is strictli limit and
from these pupil each professor choos the veri bestwho mai not be
abl to pai for their coursefor free instruct at the petrograd
conservatori where wieniawski preced me there were hundr of free
scholarship avail if a realli big talent came along he alwai had
hi opportun we took and taught those less talent at the
conservatori in order to be abl to give scholarship to the deserv
of limit mean in thi wai no real violinist geniu whom poverti
might otherwis have kept from ever realiz hi dream wa depriv
of hi chanc in life among the pupil there in my class have
scholarship were kathleen parlow elman zimbalist heifetz and
seidel
violin masteri
violin masteri to me it repres the sum total of accomplish on
the part of those who live in the histori of the art all those who mai
have di long sinc yet the memori of whose work and whose creation
still live ar the true master of the violin and it masteri is the
record of their accomplish as a child i rememb the wellknown
compos of the dai were marschner hiller nicolai and othersyet
most of what thei have written ha been forgotten on the other hand
there ar tartini nardini paganini kreutzer dont and rodethei
still live and so do ernst saras vieuxtemp and wieniawski
joachim incident the onli great german violinist of whom i
knowand he wa a hungarian though he had but few great pupil and
compos but littl will alwai be rememb becaus he togeth with
david gave violin virtuos a nobler trend and introduc a higher
ideal in the music plai for violin it is men such as these who alwai
will remain violin master just as violin masteri is defin by
what thei have done
the bach violin sonata and other composit
repli to a question as to the valu of the bach violin sonata
professor auer said my pupil alwai have to plai bach i have
publish my own revis of them with a new york hous the most
impress thing about these bach solo sonata is thei do not need an
accompani on feel it would be superflu bach compos so
rapidli he wrote with such eas that it would have been no troubl for
him to suppli on had he felt it necessari but he did not and he wa
right and thei still must be plai as he ha written them we have the
modern orchestra the modern piano but thank heaven no modern
violin such indic as i have made in my edit with regard to
bow finger nuanc of express ar more or less in accord
with the spirit of the time but not a singl note that bach ha
written ha been chang the sonata ar technic among the most
difficult thing written for the violin except ernst and paganini
not that thei ar hard in a modern wai bach knew noth of harmon
pizzicati scale in octav and tenth but hi counterpoint hi
fuguesto plai them well when the princip theme is sometim in the
outer voic sometim in the inner voic or move from on to the
otheri suprem difficult in the last sonata there is a larger
number of small movement but thi doe not make them ani easier to
plai
i have also edit the beethoven sonata togeth with rudolph ganz he
work at the piano part in new york while i studi and revis the
violin part in petrograd and norwai where i spent my summer dure
the war there wa not so much to do said professor auer modestli a
littl finger some bow indic and not much els no revis
need to put ani indic for nuanc and shade in beethoven he
wa quit abl to attend to all that himself there is no compos who
show such refin of nuanc you need onli to take hi quartet
or these same sonata to convinc yourself of the fact in my brahm
revis i have suppli realli need finger bow and other
indic import composit on which i am now at work includ
ernst fine concerto op 23 the mozart violin concerto and
tartini trill du diabl with a special cadenza for my pupil
toscha seidel
as regard prodigi
prodigi said professor auer the word prodigi when appli to
some youth artist is alwai us with an accent of reproach public
and critic ar inclin to regard them with suspicion why after all
the import thing is not their youth but their artistri examin the
histori of musicy will discov that ani number of great master
great in the matur of their geniu were great in it infanc as
well there ar mozart beethoven liszt rubinstein dalbert hofmann
scriabin wieniawskithei were all infant prodigi and certainli
not in ani objection sens not that i wish to claim that everi
prodigi necessarili becom a great master that doe not alwai
follow but i believ that a music prodigi instead of be regard
with suspicion ha a right to be look upon as a strike exampl of a
pronounc natur predisposit for music art of cours full
mental develop of artist power must come as a result of the
matur process of life itself but i firmli believ that everi
prodigi repres a valuabl music phenomenon on deserv of the
keenest interest and encourag it doe not seem right to me that
when the art of the prodigi is incontest great that the mere fact
of hi youth should serv as an excus to look upon him with prejudic
and even with a certain degre of distrust
iii
eddi brown
hubai and auer technic
hint to the student
notwithstand the fact that eddi brown wa born in chicago ill and
that he is so great a favorit with concert audienc in the land of hi
birth the gift violinist hesit to qualifi himself as a strictli
american violinist as he express it music i wa altogeth
educ in europei never studi here becaus i left thi countri at
the ag of seven and onli return a few year ago so i would not like
to be place in the posit of claim anyth under fals pretens
hubai and auer some comparison
with whom did i studi with two famou master by a strang
coincid both hungarian first with jen hubai at the nation
academi of music in budapest later with leopold auer in petrograd
hubai had been a pupil of vieuxtemp in brussel and is a justli
celebr teacher veri thorough and painstak in explain to hi
pupil how to do thing but the great differ between hubai and auer
is that while hubai tell a student how to do thing auer a
temperament teacher liter drag out of him whatev there is in
him awaken latent power he never knew he possess hubai is a
splendid builder of virtuos and ha a fine sens for phrase for a
year and a half i work at noth but studi with him give special
attent to technic he did not believ in give too much time to left
hand develop when without adequ bow technic finger facil is
useless here he wa in accord with auer in fact with everi teacher
serious deserv of the name hubai wa a firstclass pedagog and
under hi instruct on could not help becom a wellbalanc and
musicianli player but there is a higher ideal in violin plai than
mere correct and auer is an inspir teacher hubai ha written
some admir studi notabl twelv studi for the right hand
though he never stress technic too greatli on the other hand auer
most notabl contribut to violin literatur ar hi revis of
such work as the bach sonata the tschaikovski concerto etc in a wai
it point the differ in their mental attitud hubai more concern
with the technic educ mean on which cannot be overlook
auer more interest in the interpret artist educ end
which ha alwai claim hi attent hubai person wa a grand
seigneur a multimillionair and marri to an hungarian countess he
had a fine ear for phrase could improvis most interest violin
accompani to whatev hi pupil plai and besid rode kreutzer
and fiorillo i studi the concerto and other repertori work with him
then there were the conservatori lesson attend at a european
conservatori is veri broaden music not onli doe the individu
violin pupil for exampl profit by listen to hi colleagu plai in
class he also studi theori music histori the piano ensembl
plai chambermus and orchestra i wa concertmast of the
conservatori orchestra while studi with hubai there should be a
nation conservatori of music in thi countri music in gener would
advanc more rapidli and it would help teach american student to
approach the art of violin plai from the right point of view as it
is too mani want to studi abroad under some renown teacher not
primarili with the idea of becom great artist but in the hope of
draw great futur commerci dividend from an initi financi
invest in art the financi should alwai be a secondari
consider
it stand to reason that no matter how great a student gift mai be
he can profit by studi with a great teacher thi i think appli to
all after i had alreadi appear in concert at albert hall london in
1909 where i plai the beethoven concerto with orchestra i decid to
studi with auer when i first came to him he want to know why i did
so and after hear me plai told me that i did not need ani lesson
from him but i knew that there wa a certain someth which i wish
to add to my violinist makeup and instinct felt that he alon
could give me what i want i soon found that in mani essenti hi
idea coincid with those of hubai but i also discov that auer
made me develop my individu unconsci place no undu
restrict whatsoev upon my manner of express bar of
cours unmusicianli tendenc when he ha a realli talent pupil the
professor give him of hi best i never gave a thought to technic while
i studi with himth great thing were a sing tone bow
interpret i studi brahm and beethoven and though hubai alwai
finish with the bach sonata i studi them again carefulli with
auer
technic some hint to the student
at the bottom of all technic li the scale and scale practic is the
ladder by mean of which all must climb to higher profici scale
in singl tone and interv third sixth octav tenth with the
incident chang of posit ar the foundat of technic thei
should be practic slowli alwai with the develop of tone in mind
and not too long a time at ani on session no on can lai claim to a
perfect technic who ha not master the scale better a good tone
even though a hundr mistak be made in produc it than a tone that
is poor thin and without qualiti i find the singer fingerbungen ar
excel for muscular develop in scale work for impart the
great strength which is necessari for the finger to have and the
kreutzer tude ar indispens to secur an absolut legato
tone a true sing tone on the violin on should plai scale with a
perfectli well sustain and steadi bow in whole note slowli and
mezzofort take care that each note is clear and pure and that
it volum doe not vari dure the stroke the qualiti of tone must be
equal and each whole note should be sung with a singl bow
the chang from upbow to downbow and vice versa should be made
without a break exclus through skill manipul of the wrist
to accomplish thi unbroken chang of bow on should cultiv a loos
wrist and do special work at the extrem end nut and tip
the vibrato is a great tone beautifi too rapid or too slow a
vibrato defeat the object desir there is a happi medium of
tempo rather faster than slower which give the best result carl
flesch ha some interest theori about vibrat which ar worth
investig a slow and a moder rapid vibrato from the wrist
is best for practic and the underli idea while work must be
tone and not fingerwork
staccato is on of the less import branch of bow technic there
is a knack in do it and it is pure pyrotechn staccato
passag in quantiti ar onli to be found in solo of the virtuoso type
on never meet with extend staccato passag in beethoven brahm
bruch or lalo and the saintsanss violin concerto if i rememb
rightli contain but a singl staccato passag
spiccato is a veri differ matter from staccato violinist as a
rule us the middl of the bow for spiccato i us the upper third of
the bow and thu get most satisfactori result in no matter what
tempo thi question as to what portion of the bow to us for
spiccato each violinist must decid for himself howev through
experi i have tri both wai and find that by the last mention
us of the bow i secur quicker cleaner result student while
practic thi bow should take care that the wrist and never the
arm be us hubai ha written some veri excel studi for thi
form of spring bow
the trill when it roll quickli and evenli is a trill inde i never
had ani difficulti in acquir it and can keep on trill
indefinit without the slightest uneven or slacken of speed
auer himself ha assur me that i have a trill that run on and on
without a sign of fatigu or uncertainti the trill ha to be practic
veri slowli at first later with increas rapid and alwai with a
firm pressur of the finger it is a veri beauti embellish and
on much us on find it in beethoven mendelssohn brahm etc
doubl note never seem hard to me but harmon ar not as easili
acquir as some of the other violin effect i advis press down the
first finger on the string inordin especi in the higher
posit when plai artifici harmon the higher the finger
ascend on the string the more firmli thei should press them otherwis
the harmon ar apt to grow shrill and lose in clear the major
of student have troubl with their harmon becaus thei do not
practic them in thi wai of cours the qualiti of the harmon
produc vari with the qualiti of the string that produc them first
class string ar an absolut necess for the product of pure
harmon yet in the case of the artist he himself is held
respons and not hi string
octav occasion as in auer transcript of beethoven danc of
the dervish or in the close section of the ernst concerto when
thei ar us to obtain a certain weird effect thei sound well but
ordinarili if cleanli plai thei sound like onenot success in
the exampl mention the socal finger octav which ar veri
difficult ar emploi ordinari octav ar not so troublesom after
all in octav plai we simpli doubl the note for the purpos of
make them more power
as regard the plai of tenth it seem to me that the interv
alwai sound constrain and hardli ever euphoni enough to justifi
it difficulti especi in rapid passag yet paganini us thi
awkward interv veri freeli in hi composit and on of hi
capric is a variat in tenth which should be plai more often
than it is as it is veri effect in thi connect chang of
posit which i have alreadi touch on with regard to scale plai
should be so smooth that it escap notic among special effect the
glissando is realli beauti when properli done and thi call for
judgment it might be ad though that the glissando is an effect
which should not be overdon the portamentoglid from on note to
anotheri also a love effect it proper and time applic

a spanish violin
i usual plai a strad but veri often turn to my beauti
guillami said mr brown when ask about hi violin it is an old
spanish violin made in barcelona in 1728 with a tone that ha a
distinct stradivariu charact in appear it close resembl a
guadagnini and ha often been taken for on when the dealer of whom i
bought it first show it to me it wa completebut in four distinct
piec kubelik who wa in budapest at the time heard of it and want
to bui it but the dealer as wa onli right did not forget that my
offer repres a prior claim and so i secur it the guadagnini
which i have plai in all my concert here i am veri fond ofit ha a
stradivariu tone rather than the on we usual associ with the
make mr brown show the writer hi grancino a beauti littl
instrument about to be sent to the repair shop sinc exposur to the
damp atmospher of the seashor had open it seamsand the rare and
valuabl simon bow now hi which had onc been the properti of
sivori mr brown ha us a wire e ever sinc he broke six gut string
in on hour while at seal harbor main a wire string i find is not
onli easier to plai but it ha a more brilliant qualiti of tone than a
gut string and i am now so accustom to us a wire e that i would
feel ill at eas if i did not have on on my instrument contrari to
gener belief it doe not sound metal unless the string itself
is of veri poor qualiti

mischa elman
life and color in interpret
technic phase
to hear mischa elman on the concert platform to listen to him plai
with all that wealth of tone emot and impuls which place him in
the veri foremost rank of live violinist should be joi enough for
ani music lover to talk with him in hi own home howev give on a
deeper insight into hi art as an interpret and in the pleasant
intimaci of familiar convers the writer learn much that the
seriou student of the violin will be interest in know
illustr mischa elman with handwritten note
manner in plai
we all know that elman when he plai in public move hi head move
hi bodi swai in time to the music in a word there ar certain
manner associ with hi plai which critic have on occas
mention with grave suspicion as evid of sensation half
fear to insult him by ask whether he wa sincer or whether hi
motion were stage busi carefulli rehears as had been impli
i still ventur the question he laugh boyishli and wa evid
much amus
no no he said i do not studi up ani stage busi to help out
my plai i do not know whether i ought to compar myself to a dancer
but the appeal of the danc is in all music movement certain rhythm
and music combin affect me subconsci i suppos the direct
influenc of the music on me is such that there is a sort of emot
reflex i move with the music in an unconsci translat of it into
gestur it is all so individu the french violinist as a rule plai
veri correctli in public keep their ey on finger and bow and thi
appeal to me strongli in theori in practic i seem to get awai from
it it is a matter of tempera i presum i am will to believ im
not grace but theni do not know whether i move or do not move
some of my friend have spoken of it to me at variou time so i
suppos i do move and swai and all the rest but ani movement of the
sort must be unconsci for i myself know noth of them and the
idea that thei ar prepar as stage effect is delight and
again elman laugh
life and color in interpret
for that matter he continu everi real artist ha some manner
when plai i imagin yet more than manner ar need to impress
an american audienc life and color in interpret ar the true
secret of great art and beauti of interpret depend first of
all on varieti of color technic is after all onli secondari no
matter how well plai a composit be it perform must have
color nuanc movement life each emot mood of the moment must
be fulli express and if it is it appeal is sure i rememb when i
onc plai for don manuel the young exk of portug in london i
had an illustr of the fact he wa just a pathet boi veri
democrat and person veri likabl he wa somewhat neglect at
the time for it is well known and not altogeth unnatur that
royalti secur establish find king in exil a bit embarrass
don manuel wa a musiclov and especi fond of bach i had had
long talk with the young king at variou time and my sympathi had
been arous in hi behalf on the even of which i speak i plai a
chopin nocturn and i know that into my plai there went some of my
feel for the patho of the situat of thi young stranger in a
strang land of my own ag eat the bitter bread of exil when i
had finish the marchio of ripon touch my arm look at the
king she whisper don manuel had been move to tear
of cours the pure mechan must alwai be domin by the
artist person of the player yet technic is also an import
part of interpret know exactli how long to hold a bow the most
delic inflect of it pressur on the string there must be
perfect sympathi also with the compos thought hi spirit must stand
behind the person of the artist in the case of certain famou
composit like the beethoven concerto for instanc thi is so well
establish that the artist and never the compos is held respons
if it is not well plai but too rigor an adher to tradit
in plai is also an extrem i onc plai privat for joachim in
berlin it wa the bach chaconn now the edit i us wa a
standard on and joachim wa extrem reverenti as regard
tradit yet he did not hesit to indic some chang which he
thought should be made in the version of an authorit edit
becaus thei sound better and how doe it sound is realli the
true test of all interpret
absolut pitch the first essenti of a
perfect technic
what is the fundament of a perfect violin technic wa a natur
question at thi point absolut pitch first of all repli elman
promptli mani a violinist plai a difficult passag sound everi
note and yet it sound out of tune the first and second movement of
the beethoven concerto have no doublestop yet thei ar extrem
difficult to plai why becaus thei call for absolut pitch thei must
be plai in perfect tune so that each tone stand out in all it
full and clariti like a rock in the sea and without a fundament
control of pitch such a master work will alwai be beyond the
violinist reach mani a player ha the facil but without perfect
inton he can never attain the highest perfect on the other
hand ani on who can plai a singl phrase in absolut pitch ha the
first and great essenti few artist not bar some of the
greatest plai with perfect inton it control depend first of all
on the ear and a sensit ear find differ and shade it bid
the violinist plai a trifl sharper a trifl flatter accord to the
gener harmon color of the accompani it lead him to observ a
differ when the harmon atmospher demand it between a c sharp
in the kei of e major and a d flat in the same kei
technic phase
everi player find some phase of technic easi and other difficult
for instanc i have never had to work hard for qualiti of tonewhen i
wish to get certain color effect thei come i have no difficulti in
express my feel my emot in tone and in a technic wai
spiccato bow which mani find so hard ha alwai been easi to me
i have never had to work for it doublestop on the contrari cost me
hour of intens work befor i plai them with eas and facil
what did i practic scale in doublestopsthei give color and varieti
to tone and i gave up a certain portion of my regular practic time to
passag from concerto and sonata there is wonder work in
doublestop in the ernst concerto and in the paganini tude for
instanc with octav and tenth i have never had ani troubl i have a
broad hand and a wide stretch which account for it i suppos
then there ar harmon flageoletsi have never been abl to
understand why thei should be consid so difficult thei should not
be white colorless but call for just as much color as ani other tone
and ani on who ha heard mischa elman plai harmon know that thi
is no mere theori on hi part i never think of harmon as
harmon but try to give them just as much express qualiti as the
note of ani other regist the mental attitud should influenc their
productiontoo mani violinist think of them onli as incident to
pyrotechn displai
and finger finger in gener seem to me to be an individu
matter a concert artist mai us a certain finger for a certain
passag which no pupil should us and be entir justifi if he can
thu secur a certain effect
i do notspeak out of my own experiencebeliev much in method
and never to the extent that thei be allow to kill the student
individu a clear clean tone should alwai be the ideal of hi
strive and to that end he must see that the up and down bow in a
passag like the follow from the bach sonata in a minor and mr
elman hastili jot down the subjoin ar absolut
illustr music notat
even and of the same length plai with the same strength and length
of bow otherwis the note ar swallow in light spiccato and
staccato the detach note should be plai alwai with a singl
stroke of the bow some player strang to sai find staccato note
more difficult to plai at a moder tempo than fast i believ it to be
altogeth a matter of controlif proper control be there the tempo
make no differ wieniawski i have read could onli plai hi
staccati at a high rate of speed spiccato is gener held to be
more difficult than staccato yet i myself find it easier
proport in practic
to influenc a clear sing tone with the left hand to phrase it
properli with the bow hand is most import and it is a matter of
proport good phrase is spoil by an ugli tone a beauti
sing tone lose mean if improperli phrase when the student ha
reach a certain point of technic develop technic must be a
secondaryyet not neglectedconsider and he should devot
himself to the product of a good tone mani violinist have miss
their career by exagger attent to either bow or violin hand both
hand must be watch at the same time and the question of proport
should alwai be kept in mind in practic studi and passag
pressur of finger and pressur of bow must be equal coordin
the teacher can onli do a certain amount the pupil must do the rest
auer as a teacher
take auer for exampl i mai call myself the first real expon of hi
school in the sens of make hi name wide known auer is a great
teacher and leav much to the individu of hi pupil he first
heard me plai at the imperi music school in odessa and took me to
petrograd to studi with him which i did for a year and four month and
he could accomplish wonder that on year he had a littl group of four
pupil each on better than the othera veri stimul situat for
all of them there wa a magnet about him he liter hypnot
hi pupil into do better than their bestthough in some case it
wa evid that onc the support of hi magnet person wa
withdrawn the pupil fell back into the level from which he had been
rais for the time be
yet auer respect the fact that temperament i wa not respons
to thi form of appeal he gave me of hi best i never practic more
than two or three hour a dayjust enough to keep fresh often i came
to my lesson unprepar and he would have me plai thingssonata
concertoswhich i had not touch for a year or more he wa a sever
critic but alwai a just on
i can recal how proud i wa when he sent me to beauti musiclov
helsingfor in finlandwher all seem to be bloodsh and confus
nowto plai a recit in hi own stead on on occas and how proud
he wa of my success yet auer had hi littl peculiar i have read
somewher that the great fencingmast of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuri were veri jealou of the secret of their famou
feint and ripost and onli confid them to favorit pupil who
promis not to reveal them auer had hi littl secret too with
which he wa loth to part when i wa to make my dbut in berlin i
rememb he wa natur enough interestedsinc i wa hi pupilin
my score a triumph and he decid to part with some of hi treasur
technic thrust and parri and when i wa go over the
tschaikovski d minor concerto which i wa to plai he would select a
passag and sai now ill plai thi for you if you catch it well and
good if not it is your own fault i am happi to sai that i did not
fail to catch hi mean on ani occas auer realli ha a wonder
intellect and some secret well worth know that he is so great an
artist himself on the instrument is the more remark sinc
physic he wa not exception favor often when he saw me hed
sai with a sigh ah if i onli had your hand
auer wa a great virtuoso player he held a uniqu place in the
imperi ballet you know in mani of the celebr ballet
tschaikovski for instanc there occur beauti and difficult solo
for the violin thei call for an artist of the first rank and auer wa
accustom to plai them in petrograd in russia it wa consid a
decid honor to be call upon to plai on of those ballet solo but
in london it wa look on as someth quit incident i rememb
when diaghilev present tschaikovski lac de cygn in london the
grandduk andrew vladimirev who had heard me plai an amiabl young
boi and a patron of the art request meand at that time the
request of a romanov wa still equival to a commandto plai the
violin solo which accompani the love scene it wa not exactli easi
sinc i had to plai and watch dancer and conductor at the same time
yet it wa a novelti for london howev everybodi wa pleas and the
grandduk present me with a handsom diamond pin as an
acknowledg
violin masteri
you ask me what i understand by violin masteri well it seem to me
that the artist who can present anyth he plai as a distinct
pictur in everi detail frame the compos idea in the perfect
beauti of hi plastic render with absolut truth of color and
proportionh is the artist who deserv to be call a master
of cours the instrument the artist us is an import factor in
make it possibl for him to do hi best my violin it is an authent
straddat 1722 i bought it of willi burmest in london you see he
did not care much for it the german style of plai is not calcul
to bring out the tone beauti the qualiti of the old italian fiddl i
think burmest had forc the tone and it took me some time to make it
mellow and truli respons again but now mr elman beam it wa
evid he wa satisfi with hi instrument as to string he
continu i never us wire stringsthei have no color no qualiti
what to studi and how
for the advanc student there is a wealth of studi materi no on
ever wrote more beauti violin music than haendel so rich in
invent in harmon full in beethoven there ar more idea than
tonebut such idea schubertal genuin spontan bach is so
gigant that the violin often seem inadequ to express him that is
on reason why i do not plai more bach in public
the studi of a sonata or concerto should entir absorb the attent
of the student to such a degre that as he is abl to plai it it ha
becom a part of him he should be abl to plai it as though it were an
improvisationof cours without do violenc to the compos idea
if he master the composit in the wai it should be master it
becom a portion of himself befor i even take up my violin i studi a
piec thoroughli in score i read and reread it until i am at home with
the compos thought and it music balanc and proport then
when i begin to plai it it salient point ar alreadi memor and
the practic give me a kind of photograph reflex of detail after i
have not plai a number for a long time it fade from my memorylik
an old negativebut i need onli go over it onc or twice to have a
clear mnemon pictur of it onc more
ye i believ in transcript for the violinwith certain
proviso said mr elman in repli to anoth question first of all
the music to be transcrib must lend itself natur to the
instrument almost ani realli good melod line especi a
cantilena will sound with a fit harmon develop violinist
of former dai like spohr rode and paganini were more intent on
compos music out of the violin the modern idea lai stress first
of all on the idea in music in transcrib i try to forget i am a
violinist in order to form a perfect pictur of the music ideait
violinist develop must be a natur subconsci workingout if
you will look at some of my recent transcriptsth albaniz tango the
negro melodi deep river and amani fine orientaley will see
what i mean thei ar conceiv as picturesi have not tri to analyz
too muchand while so conceiv them their free harmon background
shape itself for me without strain or effort
a reminisc of colonn
conductor with whom i have plai there ar mani han richter who
wa a master of the baton nikisch on of the greatest in conduct
the orchestr accompani to a violin solo number colonn of pari
and mani other i had an amus experi with colonn onc he
brought hi orchestra to russia while i wa with auer and wa give a
concert at pavlovsk a summer resort near petrograd colonn had a
perfect horror of infant prodigi and auer had arrang for me to
plai with hi orchestra without tell him my agei wa eleven at the
time when colonn saw me violin in hand readi to step on the stage
he drew himself up and said with emphasi i plai with a prodigi
never noth could move him and i had to plai to a piano
accompani after he had heard me plai though he came over to me
and said the best apolog i can make for what i said is to ask you to
do me the honor of plai with the orchestr colonn in pari he
wa as good as hi word four month later i went to pari and plai
the mendelssohn concerto for him with great success

technic and musicianship
samuel gardner though born in jelisavetgrad cherson provinc in
southern russia in 1891 is to all intent and purpos an american
sinc hi famili flee the tyranni of an imperialist regim of
pogrom and black hundr brought him to thi countri when a mere
child and here in the unit state he ha becom to quot richard
aldrich the seriou and accomplish artist whose work on the
concert stage ha given such pleasur to lover of violin music at it
best the young violinist who in the cours of the same week had just
won two prize in compositionth pulitz prize columbia for a
string quartet and the loeb prize for a symphon poemwa amiabl
will to talk of hi studi experi for the benefit of other
student
charl martin loeffler and felix winternitz as teacher
i took up the studi of the violin at the ag of seven and when i wa
nine i went to charl martin loeffler and realli began to work
serious loeffler wa a veri strict teacher and veri exact but he
achiev result for he had a most origin wai of make hi point
clear to the student he start off with the sevcik studi lai
great stress on the proper finger articul and he taught me
absolut smooth in chang of posit when cross the string for
instanc in the second book of sevcik technic exercis in the
third exercis the bow cross from g to a and from d to e leav a
string between in each cross well i simpli could not manag to get
to the second string to be plai without the string in between
sound loeffler show me what everi good fiddler must learn to do
to leap from the end of the downbow to the upbow and vice versa and
then hesit the fraction of a moment thu secur a smooth
cleancut tone without ani vibrat of the intermedi string
loeffler never gave a pupil ani rest until he came up to hi
requir i know when i plai the seventh and eighth kreutzer
studi for himthei ar trill studiesh said you trill like an
electr bell but not fast enough and he kept at me to speed up my
tempo without loss of clear or tonevolum until i could do justic
to a rapid trill it is a great qualiti in a teacher to be liter
abl to enforc the pupil progress in certain direct for though
the latter mai not appreci it at the time later on he is sure to do
so i rememb onc when he wa try to explain the perfect
crescendo to me fireengin bell began to ring in the distanc the
sound gradual draw nearer the hous in charl street where i wa
take my lesson there you have it loeffler cri there your
ideal crescendo plai it like that and i will be satisfi i
remain with loeffler a year and a half and when he went to pari
began to studi with felix winternitz
felix winternitz wa a teacher who allow hi pupil to develop
individu i care noth for theori he us to sai so long
as i can see someth origin in your work he attach littl
import to the theori of technic but a great deal to technic
develop along individu line and he alwai encourag me to
express myself freeli within my limit stress the music side
of my work with him i plai through the concerto which after a time
i us for technic materi sinc everi phase of technic and bow
is cover in these great work i wa onli fifteen when i left
winternitz and still plai by instinct rather than intellectu i
still us my bow arm somewhat stiffli and did not think much about
phrase i instinct phrase whatev the music itself made clear
to me and what i did not understand i mere plai
kneisel teach method
but when i came to franz kneisel my last teacher i began to work with
my mind kneisel show me that i had to think when i plai at first i
did not realiz why he kept at me so insist about phrase
interpret the exact observ of express mark but eventu
it dawn on me that he wa teach me to read a soul into each
composit i studi
i practic hard from four to five hour a dai fortun as
regard technic equip i wa readi for kneisel instruct the
first thing he gave me to studi wa not a brilliant virtuoso piec but
the bach concerto in e major and then the viotti concerto in the
begin until kneisel show me i did not know what to do with them
thi wa music whose note in themselv were easi and whose
difficulti were all of an individu order but intellectu analysi
interpret ar kneisel great point a strict teacher i work
with him for five year the most remark year of all my violin
studi
kneisel know how to develop technic perfect without us
technic exercis i had alreadi plai the mendelssohn bruch and
lalo concerto with winternitz and these i now restudi with kneisel
in interpret he make clear everi phrase in it relat to everi
other phrase and the movement as a whole and he insist on hi pupil
studi theori and compositionsometh i had formerli not been
inclin to take serious
some teacher ar satisfi if the student plai hi note correctli
in a gener wai with kneisel the veri least detail a trill a scale
ha to be given it proper tonecolor and dynam shade in absolut
proport with the balanc harmoni thi trill in the first
movement of the beethoven concertoand mr gardner jot it down
illustr music notat
kneisel kept me at dure the entir lesson till i wa abl to adjust
it tonecolor and nuanc to the accompani harmoni then though
mani teacher do not know it it is a tradit in the orchestra to make
a diminuendo in the sixth measur befor the chang of kei to c
major and thi diminuendo should of cours be observ by the solo
instrument as well yet you will hear wellknown artist plai the trill
throughout with a loud brilliant tone and no dynam chang
kneisel make it a point to have all hi pupil plai chamber music
becaus of it truli broaden influenc and he is unexcel in
take apart structur the beethoven brahm tschaikovski and other
quartet in analyz and explain the wonder plan and
build up of each movement i had the honor of plai second violin
in the kneisel quartet from septemb to februari 19141915 at the
outbreak of the war a most interest experi the musicianship
kneisel had given me i wa us to hi style and at home with hi
idea and am happi to think that he wa satisfi a year later as
assist concertmast in the chicago symphoni orchestra i had a
chanc to becom practic acquaint with the orchestr work of
strauss dindi and other modern and enjoi the beethoven brahm and
tschaikovski symphoni as a perform
technic and musicianship
how do i regard technic now i think of it in the term of the music
itself music should dictat the technic mean to be us the
composit and it phrase should determin bow and the tone qualiti
emploi on should not think of downbow or upbow in the brahm
concerto you can find mani long phrase thei cannot be plai with on
bow yet there must be no appar chang of bow if the player doe not
know what the phrase mean how to interpret it how will he be abl to
bow it correctli
and there ar so mani differ nuanc especi in legato it
is as a rule produc by a slur bow yet it mai also be produc by
other bow to secur a good legato tone watch the singer the
singer can establish the perfect smooth that legato call for to
perfect to secur a like effect the violinist should convei the
impress that there is no point no frog that the bow he us is of
indefinit length and the violinist should never think i must plai
thi upbow or downbow artist of the german school ar more apt to
begin a phrase with a downbow the french start plai a good deal at
the point up or down both ar secondari to find out first of all
what qualiti what balanc of tone the phrase demand the conductor of
a symphon orchestra doe not care how technic certain effect
ar produc by the violin whether thei us an upbow or a downbow
he mere sai that too heavi give me less tone the result to be
achiev is alwai more import than the manner of achiev
all phase of technic accomplish if rightli acquir tend to
becom second natur to the player in the cours of time staccato a
brilliant trick spiccato the reiter of note plai from the
wrist etc the martellato a nuanc of spiccato should be plai
with a firm bow at the point in a veri broad spiccato the arm
mai be brought into plai but otherwis not sinc it make rapid
plai imposs too mani amateur try to plai spiccato from the
arm and too mani teacher ar content with a trill that is mere
brilliant kneisel insist on what he call a music trill of which
kreisler beauti trill is a perfect exampl the trill of some
violinist is invari brilliant whether brillianc is appropri
or not brilliant trill in bach alwai seem out of place to me while
in paganini and in wieniawski carnav de venis a high brilliant
trill is veri effect
as to doublestopsedison onc said that violin music should be
written onli in doublestopsi practic them plai first the singl
note and then the two togeth and can recommend thi mode of practic
from person experi harmon where clariti is the most import
thing ar mainli a matter of bow of a sure attack and sustain by
the bow of cours the harmon themselv ar made by the finger but
their tone qualiti rest altogeth with the bow
edison and octav
the best thing iv ever heard said of octav wa edison remark to
me that thei ar mere a nuisanc and should not be plai i wa
make some record for him dure the experiment stage of the disk
record when he wa try to get an absolut smooth legato tone
on that conform to loeffler definit of it as no break in the
tone he had had schubert av maria record by flesch macmillan
and other and want me to plai it for him the record were all
plai for me and whenev he came to the octav passag edison would
sai listen to them how badli thei sound yet the octav were
absolut in tune why do thei sound so badli i inquir
then edison explain to me that accord to the scientif theori of
vibrat the vibrat of the higher tone of the octav should be
exactli twice those of the lower note but here he continu the
vibrat of the note all vari yet how can the player control hi
finger in the vibrato beyond plai hi octav in perfect tune i
ask well if he cannot do so said edison octav ar mere a
nuisanc and should not be plai at all i experi and found
that by simpli press down the finger and plai without ani
vibrato i could come pretti near secur the exact relat between
the vibrat of the upper and lower note butthei sound dread
of cours octav sound well in ensembl especi in the
orchestra becaus each player plai but a singl note and tenth sound
even better than octav when two peopl plai them
wire and gut string
you ask about my violin it belong to the famou hawlei collect
and is a giovanni baptista guadignini made in 1780 in turin the back
is a singl piec of maplewood have a broadish figur extend
across it breadth the maplewood side match the back the top is
form of a veri choic piec of spruce and it is varnish a deep
goldenr it ha a remark fine tone veri vibrant and with great
carri power a tone that ha all that i can ask for as regard volum
and qualiti
i think that wire string ar larg us nowadai becaus gut
string ar hard to obtainnot becaus thei ar better i do not us
wire string i have tri them and find them thin in tone or so
brilliant that their tone is too pierc then too i find that the
us of a wire e reduc the volum of tone of the other string no
wire string ha the qualiti of a fine gut string and i regard them onli
as a substitut in the case of some peopl and a conveni for lazi

of violin masteri repres a combin of 90 per cent of toil and
10 per cent of talent or inspir goetschiu with whom i studi

rememb that mr hartmann wa born in mat szalka in southern hungari
then too mr hartmann is a genial and origin thinker a
littrateur of no mean abil a bibliophil the intim of the
late claud debussi and of mani of the great men of music europ yet
from the reader standpoint the interest he inspir is no doubt
mainli due to the fact that not onli is he a great interpret

of hi visit and when he learn that it purpos wa to draw on hi
knowledg and experi for inform which would be of valu to the
seriou student and lover of hi art he did not refus to respond
what violin plai realli is
violin plai is realli no abstract mysteri it as clear as
geographi in a wai on might sai the whole art is bound on the south
by the g string on the north by the e string on the west by the
string handand that about as far as the comparison mai be carri
out the point is there ar definit boundari whose technic and
esthet limit mai be extend and territori annex made
through brain power mental control to me violin masteri mean take
thi littl fiddlebox in hand and mr hartmann suit action to word
by rais the lid of hi violincas and draw forth hi beauti
1711 strad and do just what i want with it and that mean have
the right finger on the right place at the right timebut dont forget
that to be abl to do thi you must have forgotten to think of your
finger as finger thei should be simpli unconsci slave of the
artist psychic express absolut subservi to hi ideal too
mani peopl revers the process and becom slave to their finger
the problem of technic
technic for instanc in it mechan sens is a much exagger
microb of materia musica all technic must conform to it
instrumenta the violin wa made to suit the hand not the hand to
suit the violin henc it technic must be base on a natur logic of
hand movement the whole problem of technic control is encount in
the first chang of posit on the violin if we violinist could plai
in but on posit there would be no technic problem the solut of
thi problem mean speak broadli the abil to plai the
violinfor there is onli on wai of plai itwith a real full
sing violin tone it not a question of a method but just a
process base on pure reason the work out of ration principl
footnot a thi is the idea which underli my system for eartrain
and absolut pitch arthur hartmann system as i call it which i
have publish ah
what is the secret of thi sing tone well you mai call it a
secret for mani of my pupil have no inkl of it when thei first come
here though it seem veri much of an open secret to me the finish
beauti of the violin voic is a round sustain absolut smooth
cantabil tone now mr hartmann took up hi strad ill plai you
the scale of g as the averag violin student plai it you seeeach
slide from on tone to the next a breaka rosari of lurch how can
there be a round harmoni tone when the finger progress by jerk
shift posit must not be a continu movement of effort but a
continu movement in which effort and relaxationthat of dead
weightaltern as an illustr when we walk we do not
conscious set down on foot and then swing forward the other foot and
leg with a jerk the forward movement is smooth unconsci
coordin in put the foot forward it carri the weight of the
entir bodi the movement becom a matter of instinct and the same
appli to the progress of the finger in shift the posit of
the hand now plai the scale as i now doonli two finger should be
us
illustr music notat
i prepar everi shift absolut accuraci of inton and a sing
legato is the result these guid note indic ar mere a test to
prove the scientif space of the violin thei ar not sound onc
control of the hand ha been obtain thei serv onli to accustom the
finger to keep move in the direct in which thei ar go
the tone is produc by the left hand by the weight of the finger
plu an undercurr of sustain effort now you see if in the
moment of slide you prepar the bow for the next string the slide
itself is lost in the cross of the bow to carri out consist
thi idea of effort and relax in the downward progress of the
scale you will find that when you ar in the third posit the
posit of the hand is practic the same as in the first posit
henc in order to go down from third to first posit with the hand in
what might be call a block posit anoth movement is call for
to bridg over thi space between third and first posit and thi
movement is the function of the thumb the thumb preced the hand
relax the wrist and help draw the hand back to first posit but
great care must be taken that the thumb is not move until the first
finger will have been plai otherwis there will be a tendenc to
flatten in the illustr the indic for the thumb is place
after the note plai by the first finger
the inviol law of beauti plai is that there must be no
angl as i have shown you right and left hand cordin the fiddl
hand is prepar the chang of posit while the chang of string is
prepar by the right hand and alwai the slide in the left hand ar
prepar by the last plai fingerth last plai finger is the true
guid to smooth progressionjust as the bow hand prepar the slide
in the last plai bow there should be no such thing as jump and
trust in provid to land right and a curs ought to be laid on
those who let their finger leav the fingerboard none who develop thi
fundament aspect of all good plai lose the perfect control of
posit
of cours there ar a hundr nuanc of technic into which the
qualiti of good tast enter larg that on could talk of at length
phrase and the subtl thing happen in the bow arm that influenc
it spiccato whose whole secret is find the right point of balanc
in the bow and with light finger control never allow it to leav
the string iv never been abl to see the virtu of octav or the
logic of doublestop like tenth on plai or doe not plai them but
do thei add on iota of beauti to violin music i doubt it and after
all it is the poetri of plai that count all violin plai in it
essenc is the quest for color it perfect that subtl art which
hide art and which is so rare understood
could you give me a few guid rule a few beatitud as it were
for the seriou student to follow i ask mr hartmann though the
artist smile at the idea of beatitud for the violinist yet he wa
final amiabl enough to give me the follow tell me i would have
to take them for what thei were worth
nine beatitud for violinist

arrang versu transcrib
arthur hartmann like kreisler elman maud powel and other of hi
colleagu ha enrich the literatur of the violin with some notabl
fine transcript and it is a subject on which he ha welldefin
opinion and regard which he make certain distinct an
arrang he said as a rule is a pure commerci affair into
which neither art nor sthetic enter it usual consist in write
off the melodi of a songin other word plai the tune on an
instrument instead of hear it sung with wordsor in the case of a
piano composit in write off the upper voic leav the rest
intact regardless of sonor tonecolor or even effect and
furthermor without consider of the idiomat principl of the
instrument to which the adapt wa meant to fit
a transcript on the other hand can be rais to the digniti of
an artwork inde at time it mai even surpass the origin in the
qualiti of thought brought into the work the delic and sympathet
treatment and by the mani subtleti which an artist can introduc to
make it thoroughli a recreat of hi chosen instrument

had introduc in the violin melodi whistl the harmon he nod
approvingli with a pa bte a not stupid that
debussi pome for violin
debussi came near write a violin piec for me onc continu mr
hartmann and brought out a folio contain letter the great
impressionist had written him thei were a delight revel of the
human side of debussi charact and mr hartmann kindli consent to
the quotat of on bear on the pome for violin which debussi had
promis to write for him and which ala ow to hi ill and
other reason never actual came to be written
dear friend
of cours i am work a great deal now becaus i feel
the need of write music and would find it difficult
to build an aeroplan yet at time music is illnatur
even toward those who love her most then i take my
littl daughter and my hat and go walk in the boi de
boulogn where on meet peopl who have come from afar
to bore themselv in pari
i think of you i might even sai i am in need of you
assum an air of exalt and bow if you pleas as
to the pome for violin you mai rest assur that i
will write it onli at the present moment i am so
preoccupi with the fall of the hous of usher thei
talk too much to me about it ill have to put an end to
all that or i will go mad onc more i want to write it

perhap that hi talent is a thing genuin and inborn not the result
of a forc processh ha that broad interest in art and in life
go far beyond hi own particular medium the violin without which no

befor him doe not believ in all work and no plai
illustr jascha heifetz with handwritten note
the danger of practic too much
he laugh when i put forward the theori that he work mani hour a
dai perhap as mani as six or eight no he said i do not think i
could ever have made ani progress if i had practic six hour a dai in
the first place i have never believ in practic too muchit is just
as bad as practic too littl and then there ar so mani other thing
i like to do i am fond of read and i like sport tenni golf
bicycl ride boat swim etc often when i am suppos to be
practic hard i am out with my camera take pictur for i have
becom what is known as a camera fiend and just now i have a new car
which i have learn to drive and which take up a good deal of my
time i have never believ in grind in fact i think that if on ha
to work veri hard to get hi piec it will show in the execut to
interpret music properli it is necessari to elimin mechan
difficulti the audienc should not feel the struggl of the artist with
what ar consid hard passag i hardli ever practic more than
three hour a dai on an averag and besid i keep my sundai when i
do not plai at all and sometim i make an extra holidai as to six or
seven hour a dai i would not have been abl to stand it at all
i impli that what mr heifetz said might shock thousand of aspir
young violinist for whom he point a moral of cours hi answer
wa you must not take me too liter pleas do not think becaus i
do not favor overdo practic that on can do without it im quit
frank to sai i could not myself but there is a happi medium i suppos
that when i plai in public it look easi but befor i ever came on the
concert stage i work veri hard and i do yetbut alwai put the
two thing togeth mental work and physic work and when a certain
point of effort is reach in practic as in everyth els there
must be relax
the develop of a virtuos technic
have i what is call a natur technic it is hard for me to sai
perhap so but if such is the case i had to develop it to assur it
to perfect it if you start plai at three as i did with a littl
violin onequart of the regular size i suppos violin plai becom
second natur in the cours of time i wa abl to find my wai about in
all seven posit within a year time and could plai the kayser
tude but that doe not mean to sai i wa a virtuoso by ani mean
my first teacher my first teacher wa my father a good violinist and
concertmast of the vilna symphoni orchestra my first appear in
public took place in an overcrowd auditorium of the imperi music
school in vilna russia when i wa not quit five i plai the
fantaisi pastoral with piano accompani later at the ag of
six i plai the mendelssohn concerto in kovno to a full hous
stagefright no i cannot sai i have ever had it of cours someth
mai happen to upset on befor a concert and on doe not feel quit at
eas when first step on the stage but then i hope that is not
stagefright
at the imperi music school in vilna and befor i work at all the
thing everi violinist studiesi think that i plai almost everyth
i did not work too hard but i work hard enough in vilna my teacher
wa malkin a pupil of professor auer and when i had graduat from the
vilna school i went to auer did i go directli to hi class well
no but i had onli a veri short time to wait befor i join the
class conduct by auer person
professor auer as a teacher
ye he is a wonder and an incompar teacher i do not believ
there is on in the world who can possibl approach him do not ask me
just how he doe it for i would not know how to tell you but he is
differ with each pupilperhap that is on reason he is so great a
teacher i think i wa with professor auer about six year and i had
both class lesson and privat lesson of him though toward the end my
lesson were not so regular i never plai exercis or technic work
of ani kind for the professor but outsid of the big thingsth
concerto and sonata and the shorter piec which he would let me
preparei often chose what i want
professor auer wa a veri activ and energet teacher he wa never
satisfi with a mere explan unless certain it wa understood he
could alwai show you himself with hi bow and violin the professor
pupil were suppos to have been suffici advanc in the technic
necessari for them to profit by hi wonder lesson in
interpret yet there were all sort of technic finess which
he had up hi sleev ani number of fine subtl point in plai as
well as interpret which he would disclos to hi pupil and the
more interest and abil the pupil show the more the professor gave
him of himself he is a veri great teacher bow the true art of
bow is on of the greatest thing in professor auer teach i
know when i first came to the professor he show me thing in bow i
had never learn in vilna it is hard to describ in word mr heifetz
illustr with some of those natur unstrain movement of arm and
wrist which hi concert appear have made so familiar but bow
as professor auer teach it is a veri special thing the movement of
the bow becom more easi grace less stiff
in class there were usual from twentyf to thirti pupil asid
from what we each gain individu from the professor critic and
correct it wa interest to hear the other who plai befor
on turn came becaus on could get all kind of hint from what
professor auer told them i know i alwai enjoi listen to poliakin
a veri talent violinist and ccile hansen who attend the class
at the same time i did the professor wa a stern and veri exact but
a sympathet teacher if our plai wa not just what it should be he
alwai had a fund of kindli humor upon which to draw he would
anticip our stock excus and sai well i suppos you have just had
your bow rehair or these new string ar veri try or it the
weather that is against you again is it not or someth of the kind
examin were not so easi we had to show that we were not onli
soloist but also sight reader of difficult music
a difficulti overcom
the greatest technic difficulti i had when i wa studi jascha
heifetz tri to recollect which wa natur see that it must have
been on long sinc overcom then he rememb and smile
staccato plai to get a good staccato when i first tri seem
veri hard to me when i wa younger realli at on time i had a veri
poor staccato i assur the young artist that ani on who heard him
plai here would find it hard to believ thi ye i did he
insist but on morn i do not know just how it wasi wa
plai the cadenza in the first movement of wieniawski fmusic sharp sign minor
concertoit is full of staccato and doubl stopsth right wai of
plai staccato came to me quit suddenli especi after professor
auer had shown me hi method
violin masteri
violin masteri to me it mean the abil to make the violin a
perfectli control instrument guid by the skill and intellig of
the artist to compel it to respond in movement to hi everi wish the
artist must alwai be superior to hi instrument it must be hi
servant on that he can do with what he will
technic masteri and tempera
it appear to me that masteri of the technic of the violin is not so
much of a mechan accomplish as it is of mental natur it mai be
that scientist can tell us how through persist the brain succe
in make the finger and the arm produc result through the infinit
varieti of inexplic vibrat the sweet of tone it
melodi it legato octav trill and harmon all bear
the mark of the individu who us hi string like hi vocal chord
when an artist is work over hi harmon he must not be impati
and forc puriti pitch or the right inton he must coax the tone
try it again and again seek for improv in hi finger as well
as in hi bow at the same time and sometim he mai be surpris
how quit suddenli at the time when he least expect it the result
ha come more than on road lead to rome the fact is that when you
get it you have it that all i am perfectli will to disclos to
the music profess all the secret of the masteri of violin technic
but ar there ani secret in the sens that some of the uniniti take
them if an artist happen to excel in some particular he is at onc
suspect of know some secret mean of so do howev that mai
not be the case he doe it just becaus it is in him and as a rule he
accomplish thi through hi mental faculti more than through hi
mechan abil i do not intend to minim the valu of great
teacher who prove to be import factor in the life of a musician
but think of the vast armi of pupil that a master teacher bring
forth and listen to the infinit varieti of their spiccato
octav legato and trill for the success masteri of violin
technic let each artist studi carefulli hi own individu let him
concentr hi mental energi on the qualiti of pitch he intend to
produc and sooner or later he will find hi wai of express himself
music is not onli in the finger or in the elbow it is in that
mysteri ego of the man it is hi soul and hi bodi is like hi
violin noth but a tool of cours the great master must have the
tool that suit him best and it is the happi combin that make for
success
by the vibrat and modul of the note on mai recogn the
violinist as easili as we recogn the singer by hi voic who can
explain how the artist harmon the trill of hi finger with the
emot of hi soul
an artist will never becom great through mere imit and never
will he be abl to attain the best result onli by method adopt by
other he must have hi own initi although he will sure profit
by the experi of other of cours there ar standard wai of
approach the studi of violin technic but these ar too well known to
dwell upon them as to the niceti of the art thei must come from
within you can make a musician but not an artist
repertori and program
which of the master work do i like best well that is rather hard to
answer each master work ha it own beauti natur on like best
what on understand best i prefer to plai the classic like brahm
beethoven mozart bach mendelssohn etc howev i plai bruch g
minor in 1913 at the leipzig gewandhous with nikisch where i wa told
that joachim wa the onli other violinist as young as myself to appear
there as soloist with orchestra there is the tschaikovski concerto
which i plai in berlin in 1912 with the berlin philharmon orchestra
with nikisch alsa bruch d minor and mani more i plai the
mendelssohn concerto in 1914 in vienna with safonoff as conductor
last season in chicago i plai the brahm concerto with a fine and veri
elabor cadenza by professor auer i think the brahm concerto for
violin is like chopin music for piano in a wai becaus it stand
technic and music for someth quit differ and distinct
from other violin music just as chopin doe from other piano music the
brahm concerto is not technic as hard as sai paganinibut in
interpret and in the beethoven concerto too there is a
simplic a kind of clear beauti which make it far harder to plai
than mani other thing technic more advanc the slightest flaw
the least differ in pitch in inton and it beauti suffer
ye there ar other russian concerto besid the tschaikovski there
is the glazounov concerto and other i understand that zimbalist wa
the first to introduc it in thi countri and i expect to plai it here
next season
of cours on cannot alwai plai concerto and on cannot alwai plai
bach and beethoven and that make it hard to select program the
artist can alwai enjoi the great music of hi instrument but an
audienc want varieti at the same time an artist cannot plai onli just
what the major of the audienc want i have been ask to plai
schubert av maria or beethoven choru of dervish at everi
on of my concert but i simpli cannot plai them all the time i am
afraid if program make were left altogeth to audienc the program
would becom far too popular in charact though audienc ar just as
differ as individu i try hard to balanc my program so that
everi on can find someth to understand and enjoi i expect to
prepar some american composit for next season oh no not as a
matter of courtesi but becaus thei ar realli fine especi some
smaller piec by spald cecil burleigh and grass
on conclud our interview mr heifetz made a remark which is worth
repeat and which mani a music lover who is plu royalist que le
roi might do well to rememb after all he said much as i love
music i cannot help feel that music is not the onli thing in life i
realli cannot imagin anyth more terribl than alwai to hear think
and make music there is so much els to know and appreci and i feel
that the more i learn and know of other thing the better artist i will
be

the violin as a mean of express
and express plai
the writer talk with lieuten david hochstein whose death in the
battl of the argonn forest wa onli report toward the end of
januari while the distinguish young violinist then onli a sergeant
wa on the ev of departur to franc with hi regiment and as he
modestli said hi thought on music were rather scatter yet he
spoke with keen insight and author on variou phase of hi art and
much of what he said gain point from hi own splendid work as a concert
violinist for lieuten hochstein whose stand ha been establish
in numer european as well as american recit could plai what he
preach
sevcik and auer a contrast in teach
know that in the regiment band he wa quit appropri a
clarinetist the clarinet in the militari band be the equival of
the violin in the orchestraand a scholarship pupil of the vienna
meisterschul it seem natur to ask him concern hi teacher
and the interest fact develop that he had studi with the
celebr bohemian pedagog sevcik and with leopold auer as well two
teacher whose idea and method differ materi i studi with
sevcik for two year said the young violinist it wa in 1909 when a
class of ten pupil wa form for him in the meisterschul at
vienna that i went to him sevcik wa in mani wai a wonder teacher
yet inclin to overemphas the mechan side of the art he
liter taught hi pupil how to practic how to develop technic
control by the most slow and painstak studi in addit to hi own
fine method and exercis he also us gavini dont rode kreutzer
appli in their studi idea of hi own
auer as a teacher i found altogeth differ where sevcik taught hi
pupil the technic of their art by mean of a system elabor work
out auer demonstr hi idea through sheer person mainli from
the interpret point of view ani ambiti student could learn much
of valu from either yet in a gener wai on might express the
differ between them by sai that sevcik could take a pupil of
medium talent andat least from the mechan standpointmak an
excel violinist of him but auer is an ideal teacher for the greatli
gift and he is especi skill in take some student of the
violin while hi mind is still plastic and suscept and mold
itsuppli it with lofti concept of interpret and express
of cours auer i studi with him in petrograd and dresden ha been
especi fortun as regard hi pupil too becaus activ in a
land like russia where music geniu ha almost becom a commonplac
sevcik though an admir teacher person is of a reserv and
reflect type quit differ from auer who is open and expans i
might recal a littl instanc which show sevcik cautiou natur the
care he take not to commit himself too unreservedli when i took leav
of himit wa after i had graduat and won my prizei natur like
all hi pupil ask him for hi photo sever other pupil of hi
were in the room at the time he took up hi pen i wa look over
hi shoulder commenc to write meinem best and then he stop
glanc at the other pupil in the room and wrote over the best
he had alreadi written the word liebsten but though i would of
cours have prefer the first inscript had sevcik complet it i
can still consol myself that the other even though i valu it wa an
afterthought but it wa a characterist thing for him to do
the violin as a mean of express
what is my idea of the violin as a medium of express it seem to me
that it is that of ani other valid artist medium it is not so much a
question of the violin as of the violinist a great interpret reveal
hi innermost soul through hi instrument whatev it mai be most
peopl think the violin is more express than ani other instrument
but thi is open to question it mai be that most peopl respond more
readili to the appeal made by the violin but genuin express
express plai depend on the messag the player ha to deliv far
more than on the instrument he us as a mean i have been as much
move by some piano plai i have heard as by the violin plai of
some of the greatest violinist
and varieti nuanc in express plai is larg a matter of the
player mental attitud bach chaconn or sicilienn call for a
certain humil on the part of the artist when i plai bach i do it
reverenti a definit spiritu qualiti in my tone and express is
the result and to select a compos who in mani wai is bach exact
opposit wieniawski a certain audaci brillianc cannot help but
make itself felt tonal if thi music is to be plai in charact
the mental and spiritu attitud directli influenc it own mechan
transmiss no on artist should critic anoth for differ in
interpret in express so long as thei ar justifi by larger
concept of art individu is on of the artist most preciou
possess and there ar alwai a number of differ angl from
which the interpret of an art work mai be approach
violin masteri
violin masteri there have been onli three violinist within my own
recollect whom i would call master of the violin these ar
kubelik when at hi best franz von vecsei hubai pupil whom i
heard abroad and heifetz with hi cameolik perfect of technic
these i would call master of the violin as an instrument sinc thei
have master everi intricaci of the instrument but i could name
sever other who ar greater musician and whose plai and
interpret to sai noth of tone i prefer
tone product rhythm
in on sens true violin masteri is a question of tone product and
rhythm and i believ that tone product depend princip upon the
imagin ear of the player thi statement mai seem somewhat
ambigu and on might ask what is an imagin ear my ear for
instanc demand of my violin a certain qualiti of tone which vari
accord to the music i am plai but befor i think of plai the
music i alreadi know from read it what i want it to sound like that
is to sai the qualiti of the tone i wish to secur in each princip
phrase rhythm is perhap the greatest factor in interpret everi
good musician ha a good sens of rhythm that much abus phrase
but it is onli the great musician who make so strike and
individu an applic of rhythm that hi plai mai be easili
distinguish by hi us of it
there is not much to tell you as regard my method of work i usual
work directli upon a program which ha been previous map out if i
have been awai from my violin for more than a week or two i begin by
practic scale but ordinarili i find my technic work in the
program i am prepar
ask about hi band experi at camp upton sergeant hochstein wa
enthusiast no violinist could help but gain much from work with a
militari band at on of the camp he said for instanc i had a more
or less theoret knowledg of wind instrument befor i went to camp
upton now i have a practic work knowledg of them i have alreadi
score a littl violin composit of mine a minuet in olden style
for full band and have found it possibl by the right manipul to
preserv it origin dainti and grace charact in spite of the
fact that it is plai by more than forti militari bandsmen
then too he said in conclus i have organ a real orchestra
of twentyon player string brass woodwind etc which i hope is
go to be of real us on the other side dure our train period in
franc you see over there the soldier boi chanc for leav ar
limit and we will have to depend a good deal on our own selv for
amus and recreat i hope and believ my orchestra is not onli
go to take it place as on of the most enjoy featur of our
armi life but also that it will make propaganda of the right sort for
the best music in a broad cathol sens of the word
it is interest to know that thi patriot young offic found
opportun in camp and in the town of franc of carri out hi
wish to make propaganda of the right sort for the best music befor he
gave hi life to further the greater purpos which had call him

fritz kreisler
person in art
the influenc of the artist person in hi art find a most
strike exemplif in the case of fritz kreisler some time befor
the writer call on the famou violinist to get at first hand some of
hi opinion with regard to hi art he had alreadi met him under
particularli interest circumst the question had come up of
write textpoem for two songadapt of viennes folkthem
air not unattract in themselv but which kreisler person
touch hi individu gift of harmon had lift from a lower
plane to the level of the art song togeth with the mss of hi own
beauti transcript mr kreisler in the on instanc had given me the
print origin which suggest itfrankli a popular song clumsili
harmon in a foursquar manner though written in 34 time with
noth to indic it latent possibl i compar it with hi
mss and lo it had been transform gone wa the clumsi the
vulgar and obviou harmon treatment of the melodykreisl had kept
the melod outlin but ether spiritu it given it new
rhythmic contour a deeper and more express mean and hi rich
and subtl harmon had lent it a qualiti of distinct that
justifi a comparison between the grub and the butterfli in a small
wai it wa an illumin glimps of how the person of a true
artist can metamorphos what at first glanc might seem someth quit
neglig and creat beauti where it possibl alon had exist
befor
it is thi person thi individu note in all that fritz kreisler
doeswhen he plai when he compos when he transcribesthat give
hi arteffort so great and uniqu a qualiti of appeal
talk to him in hi comfort sittingroom in the hotel
wellingtonhom and juven in the origin rank on the pianotop
besid de vere stackpol novel and other contemporari literatur call
to mind that though brahm and beethoven violin concerto ar among hi
favorit he doe not disdain to plai a granado spanish danceit
seem natur to ask him how he came to make those adapt and
transcript which have been so notabl a featur of hi program and
which have given such pleasur to thousand
illustr fritz kreisler with handwritten note
how kreisler came to compos and arrang
he said i began to compos and arrang as a young man i want to
creat a repertori for myself to be abl to express through my medium
the violin a great deal of beauti music that had first to be adapt
for the instrument what i compos and arrang wa for my own us
reflect my own music tast and prefer in fact it wa not
till year after that i even thought of publish the piec i had
compos and arrang for i wa veri diffid as to the outcom of
such a step i have never written anyth with the commerci idea of
make it playabl and i have alwai felt that anyth done in a
coldblood wai for pure mercenari consider somehow cannot be
good it cannot repres an artist best
at the vienna conservatori
in repli to anoth queri mr kreisler revert to the dai when as a
boi he studi at the vienna conservatori i wa onli seven when i
attend the conservatori and wa much more interest in plai in the
park where my boi friend would be wait for me than in take
lesson on the violin and yet some of the most last music
impress of my life were gather there not so much as regard studi
itself as with respect to the good music i heard some veri great men
plai at the conservatori when i wa a pupil there were joachim
saras in hi prime hellmesberg and rubinstein whom i heard plai
the first time he came to vienna i realli believ that hear joachim
and rubinstein plai wa a greater event in my life and did more for me
than five year of studi
of cours you do not regard technic as the main essenti of the
concert violinist equip i ask him decidedli not sincer
and person ar the first main essenti technic equip is
someth which should be taken for grant the virtuoso of the type
of ol bull let us sai ha disappear the stunt player of a former
dai with a repertori of three or four bravura piec wa not far abov
the averag musichal artist the modern virtuoso the true concert
artist is not worthi of the titl unless hi art is the outcom of a
complet unifi natur
violin masteri
i do not believ that ani artist is truli a master of hi instrument
unless hi control of it is an integr part of a whole the musician is
bornhi medium of express is often a matter of accid i believ
on mai be intend for an artist prenat but whether violinist
cellist or pianist is partli a matter of circumst violin masteri
to my mind still fall short of perfect in spite of the completest
technic and music equip if the artist think onli of the
instrument he plai after all it is just a singl medium of
express the true musician is an artist with a special instrument
and everi real artist ha the feel for other form and medium of
express if he is truli a master of hi own
technic versu imagin
i think the technic element in the artist educ is often unduli
stress rememb ad mr kreisler with a smile i am not a
teacher and thi is a pure person opinion i am give you but it
seem to me that absolut sincer of effort actual imposs
not to react to a genuin music impuls ar of great import i
firmli believ that if on is destin to becom an artist the technic
mean find themselv the necess of express will follow the line
of least resist too great a manual equip often lead to an
exagger of the technic and tempt the artist to stress it unduli
i have work a great deal in my life but have alwai found that too
larg an amount of pure technicomus work fatigu me and react
unfavor on my imagin as a rule i onli practic enough to keep
my finger in trim the nervou strain is such that do more is out of
the question and for a concertviolinist when on tour plai everi
dai the technic question is not absorb far more import is it
for him to keep himself mental and physic fresh and in the right
mood for hi work for myself i have to enjoi whatev i plai or i
cannot plai it and it ha often done me more good to dip my fingertip
in hot water for a few second befor step out on the platform than
to spend a coupl of hour practic but i should not wish the student
to draw ani deduct from what i sai on thi head it is pure
person and ha no gener applic
technic exercis i us veri moder i wish my imagin to be
respons my interest fresh and as a rule i have found that too much
work along routin channel doe not accord with the best develop of
my art i feel that technic should be in the player head it should be
a mental pictur a sort of master record it should be a matter of
will power to which the manual possibl should be subject
technic to me is a mental and not a manual thing
mental technic it drawback and it advantag
the technic thu achiev a technic whose control power is chiefli
mental is not perfecti sai so franklybecaus it is more or less
depend on the state of the artist nervou system yet it is the on
and onli kind of technic that can adequ and complet express the
musician everi instinct wish and emot everi other form of technic
is stiff unpliabl sinc it cannot entir subordin itself to the
individu of the artist
practic hour for the advanc student
mr kreisler give no lesson and henc refer thi question in the
most amiabl manner to hi boyhood friend and fellowstud felix
winternitz the wellknown boston violin teacher on of the faculti of
the new england conservatori of music who had come in while we were
talk mr winternitz did not refus an answer the seriou student
in my opinion should not practic less than four hour a dai nor need
he practic more than five other teacher mai demand more sevcik i
know insist that hi pupil practic eight and ten hour a dai to do
so on must have the constitut of an ox and the result ar often
not equal to those produc by four hour of concentr work as mr
kreisler intim with regard to technic practic call for brain
power concentr in itself is not enough there is onli on wai to
work and if the pupil can find it he can cover the labor of week in an
hour
and turn to me mr winternitz ad you must not take mr kreisler
too serious when he lai no stress on hi own practic dure the
concert season he ha hi violin in hand for an hour or so nearli everi
dai he doe not call it practic and you and i would consid it
plai and great plai at that but it is a genuin illustr of
what i meant when i said that on who knew how could cover the work of
week in an hour time
an explan by mr winternitz
i tri to draw from the famou violinist some hint as to the secret of
the abid popular of hi own composit and transcript buta
those who know him ar awarekreisl ha all the modesti of the truli
great he mere smile and said frankli i dont know but mr
winternitz comment when a phone call had taken kreisler from the room
for a moment wa it is the touch given by hi accompani that
add so much a harmon treatment so rich in design and color and
so vari that melodi were never more beautifulli set off mr
kreisler as he came in again remark i dont mind tell you that
i enjoi veri much write my tambourin chinoisa the idea for it
came to me after a visit to the chines theater in san francisconot
that the music there suggest ani theme but it gave me the impuls to
write a free fantasi in the chines manner
footnot a it is interest to note that nikolai sokoloff conductor
of the san francisco philharmon return from a tour of the american
and french armi camp in franc some time ago said my most popular
number wa kreisler tambourin chinoi invari i had to repeat
that a strong indors of the internation of art by the actual
fighter in the trench
style interpret and the artist ideal
the question of style now came up i am not in favor of label the
concert artist of call him a lyric or a dramat or some other
kind of a player if he is an artist in the real sens he control all
style then in answer to anoth question noth can express music
but music itself tradit in interpret doe not mean a
cutanddri set of rule hand down it is or should be a matter
of individu sentiment of inner convict what make on man an
artist and keep anoth an amateur is a godgiven instinct for the
artist and music right it is not a thing to be explain but
to be felt there is often onli a narrow line of demarc between the
artist right and wrong yet nearli everi real artist will be found
to agre as to when and when not that boundari ha been overstep
sincer and person as well as disinterested an express of
himself in hi art that is absolut honest these i believ ar
ideal which everi artist should cherish and try to realiz i believ
furthermor that these ideal will come more and more into their own
that after the war there will be a great uplift and that art will
realiz to the full it valu as a human factor in life and as is
well known no great artist of our dai ha done more toward the actual
realiz of these ideal he cherish than fritz kreisler himself

franz kneisel
the perfect string ensembl
is there a lover of chamber music unfamiliar with franz kneisel name
it mai be doubt after earlier european triumph the gift roumanian
violinist came to thi countri 1885 and asid from hi activ in
other directionsa a solo artist he wa the first to plai the brahm
and goldmark violin concerto and the csar franck sonata in thi
countryorgan hi famou quartet and until hi recent retir
as it director and first violin it ha been perhap the greatest
singl influenc toward stimul appreci for the best in chamber
music that the countri ha known befor the flonzalei wa the kneisel
were thei made plain how much of beauti the chamber music repertori
offer the amateur string player not onli in the classic
repertoryhaydn mozart beethoven spohr in schubert schumann
brahm but in smetana dvork and tschaikovski in csar franck
debussi and ravel not the least among kneisel achiev is that
while the profession musician in the citi in which hi organ
plai attend it concert as a matter of cours the averag music
lover who plai a string instrument came to them as well and carri
awai with him a messag deliv with all the author of superb
musicianship and sincer on which bade him go and do likewis in
so far as hi limit permit and the mani excel profession
chamber music organ trio quartet and ensembl of variou
kind which have come to the fore sinc thei began to plai offer
eloqu testimoni with regard to the cultur work of kneisel and hi
fellow artist
illustr franz kneisel with signatur
a cheeri grate fire burn in the comfort studi in franz kneisel
home the autographedin what affection and appreci
termspictur of great fellow artist look down abov the bookcas
which hold the score of those master of what ha been call the
noblest medium of music in exist whose beauti the famou quartet
ha so often disclos on the concert stage and mr kneisel wa
amiabl personifi when i ask him to give me hi theori of the
perfect string ensembl and the part virtuos plai in it
the artist rank the virtuoso in chamber music
the artist the tonknstler to us a foreign phrase rank the
virtuoso in chamber music joachim wa no virtuoso he did not stress
technic the less import factor in ensembl plai saras wa a
virtuoso in the best sens of the word and yet as an ensembl music
player he fell far short of joachim as i see it virtuoso is a kind of
flatter titl no more but a tonknstler a toneartist though
he must have the virtuoso technic in order to plai brahm and beethoven
concerto need besid a spiritu insight a deep concept of their
nobil to do them justiceth mere technic demand for a virtuoso
show piec is not enough
violin masteri in the string quartet
you ask me what violin masteri mean in the string quartet it ha an
altogeth differ mean to me i imagin than to the violin
virtuoso violin masteri in the string ensembl is as much masteri of
self as of technic mean the artist must sink hi ident complet
in that of the work he plai and though the last beethoven quartet ar
as difficult as mani violin concerto thei ar polyphoni the
combin and interweav of individu melodi and thei call for a
masteri of repress as well as express i realiz how keenli aliv
the music listen is to thi fact onc when our quartet had plai in
almatadema beauti london home for the great english painter wa
also a musiclov and a veri discrimin on he had a fine piano in
a beautifulli decor case and it wa an open secret that at hi
music even after an artist had plai the lid of the piano wa
rais and sir lawrenc ask him to pencil hi autograph on the soft
white wood of it inner surfacebut onli if he thought the compliment
deserv there were some famou name written therejoachim
saras paderewski neruda piatti to mention a few natur an
artist plai at almatadema home for the first time could not help
specul as to hi chanc mani were call but compar few
were chosen we were guest at a dinner given by sir lawrenc there
were some fifti peopl promin in london artist music and
social world present and we had no idea of be ask to plai our
instrument were at our hotel and we had to send for them we plai the
schubert quartet in a minor and dvork american quartet and of
cours my colleagu and myself forgot all about the piano lid the
moment we began to plai yet im free to confess that when the piano
lid wa rais for us we appreci it for it wa no empti compliment
come from sir lawrenc and i have been told that some veri
distinguish artist have not had it extend to them and i know that
on that even the phrase violin masteri in an ensembl sens as
the outcom of ceaseless strive for cordin in express
absolut balanc and all the detail that go to make up the perfect
ensembl seem to us to have a veri definit color and mean
the first violin in the string quartet
what exactli doe the first violin repres mr kneisel went on in
answer to anoth question the first violin might be call the
chairman of the string meet hi is the lead voic not that he
should be an autocrat no but he must hold the rein of disciplin
mani think that the four string player in a quartet have equal right
first of all and abov all ar the right of the compos bach
beethoven brahm schuberta the case mai be but from the
standpoint of interpret the first violin ha some seventi per cent
of the respons as compar with thirti per cent for the
remain voic in all the famou quartet organ joachim
hellmesberg etc the first violin ha been the direct instrument
and ha set the pace as chairman it ha been hi duti to sai when
second violin viola and cello were entitl to hold the floor
hellmesberg in fact consid himself the whole quartet mr
kneisel smile and show me a littl book of hellmesberg vienna
program each program wa head
hellmesberg quartet
with the assist of
messr math durst carl heissler
carl schlesing
in other word hellmesberg wa the quartet himself the other three
artist mere assist which after all is go too far
of cours quartet differ just as we have opera in which the alto
solo rle is the most import so we have quartet in which the
cello or the viola ha a more signific part mozart dedic
quartet to a king of prussia who plai cello and he wa care to
make the cello part the most import and in smetana quartet au
meinem leben the viola plai a most import rle even the second
violin often plai theme introduc princip theme of the first
violin and it ha it brief moment of promin yet though the
second violin or the cellist mai be compar speak a better
player than the first violin the latter is and must be the leader
practic everi compos of chamber music recogn the fact in hi
composit he the first violin should not command three slave
though but guid three associ and do it tactfulli with regard to
their individu and that of their instrument
ensembl rehears
you ask what ar the essenti of ensembl practic on the part of
the artist real rever untir zeal and punctual at
rehears and then an absolut sens of rhythm i rememb
rehears a volkmann quartet onc with a new second violinist mr
kneisel cross over to hi bookcas and brought me the score to
illustr the rhythmic point in question on slight in itself yet as
difficult perhap for a player without an absolut sens of rhythm as
perfect inton would be for some other he had a love tone a
big technic and wa a prize pupil of the vienna conservatori we went
over thi two measur phrase some sixteen time until i felt sure he
had grasp the proper accentu and he wa most amiabl and will
about it too but when we broke up he point to the passag and said
to me with a smile after all whether you plai it thi wai or
that wai what the differ then i realiz that he had stress
hi note correctli a few time by chanc and that hi own sens of
rhythm did not tell him that there were no two wai about it the
rhythmic and tonal nuanc in a quartet cannot be mark too perfectli
in order to secur a beauti and finish perform and such a
violinist as the on mention in spite of hi tone and technic wa
never meant for an ensembl player
i have never believ in a quartet get togeth and read a
new work as a prepar for studi as first violin i have alwai made
it my busi to first studi the work in score myself to studi it
until i knew the whole composit absolut until i had a mental
pictur of it mean and of the interrel of it four voic in
detail thirtytwo year of experi have justifi my theori onc
the first violin know the work the practic mai begin for he is in a
posit gradual and tactfulli to guid the workingout of the
interpret without lose time in the struggl to correct fault in
balanc which ar develop in an unprepar read of the work
there is alwai on import melodi and it is easier to find it
studi the score to trace it with ey and mind in it contrapunt
web than by make voyag of discoveri in actual plai
everi player ha hi own qualiti everi instrument it own
advantag certain passag in a second violin or viola part mai be
technic better suit to the hand of the player to the natur of
the instrument andthei will sound better than other yet from the
standpoint of the composit the passag that lie well ar often not
the more import thi is hard for the playerwhat is easi for him
he unconsci is inclin to stress and he must be on hi guard
against it thi is anoth strong argument in favor of a thorough
preliminari studi on the part of the lead violin of the construct
of the work
the first violin in chamber music versu
the orchestra conductor
the comparison which i ask mr kneisel to make is on which he could
establish with author asid from hi experi as director of hi
quartet he ha been the concertmeist of such famou foreign
orchestra as bils and that of the hofburg theater in vienna and
for eighteen year of the boston symphoni orchestra in thi countri he
ha also conduct over on hundr concert of the boston symphoni and
wa director of the worcest music festiv
nikisch onc said to me after he had heard us plai the schumann a
minor quartet in boston kneisel it wa beauti and i felt that you
had more difficulti in develop it than i have with an orchestr
score and i think he wa right first of all the symphon conductor
is an autocrat there is no appeal from the command of hi baton but
the first violin of a quartet is in a sens onli the first among
peer the velvet glove is an absolut necess in hi case he must
gain hi art end by diplomaci and tact he must alwai rememb that
hi fellow artist ar solo player if he is arbitrari no matter how
right he mai be he disturb that fine feel of artist fellowship
that delic balanc of individu tempera harmon for and by a
singl purpos in thi connect i do not mind confess that though
i enjoi a good game of card i made it a rule never to plai card with
my colleagu dure the hour of railroad travel involv in keep
our concert engag i plai chess in chess the element of luck
doe not enter each player is respons for what he doe or leav
undon and defeat leav no such sting as it doe when all mai be
blame on chanc in an ensembl that strive for perfect there
must be no undercurr of regret of dissatisfactionnoth that
interfer with the sympathi and good will which make each individu
artist do hi best and so i have never regret give card the
gobi
hint to the seriou violin student
of late year mr kneisel activ as a teacher ha ad to hi
reput few teacher can point to a galaxi of artist pupil which
includ such name as samuel gardner sascha jacobsen breskin helen
jeffri and oliv mead who perpetu the ideal of hi great string
ensembl in her own quartet what is the secret of your method i
ask him first of all method is hardli the word he told me it
sound too cutanddri i teach accord to principl which must
of cours vari in individu case yet whose foundat is fix and
like joachim or leschetiszki i have preparatori teacher
the gener fault
my experi ha shown me that the fundament fault of most pupil is
that thei do not know how to hold either the bow or the violin here in
america the violin student as a rule begin seriou technic studi too
late contrari to the european practic it is a great handicap to begin
realli seriou work at seventeen or eighteen when the flexibl bone
of childhood have harden and have not the pliabil need for
violin gymnast it is a case of not bend the twig as you want the
tree to grow in time and those who studi profession ar often more
interest in make monei as soon as possibl than in bend all their
energi on reach the higher level of their art mani a promis
talent never develop becaus it possessor at seventeen or eighteen is
eager to earn monei as an orchestra or job player instead of
sacrif a few year more and becom a true artist iv seen it
happen time and again a young fellow realli endow who think he can
plai for a live and find time to studi and practic after hour and
he never doe
but to return to the gener fault of the violin student there is a
certain angl at which the bow should cross the string in order to
produc those vibrat which give the roundest fullest most perfect
tone he took hi own beauti instrument out of it case to illustr
the point and the violin must be so held that the bow move straight
across the string in thi manner a deviat from the correct attack
produc a scratchi tone and it is just in the on fundament thing
the hold of the violin in exactli the same posit when it is taken
up by the player never vari by so much as halfaninch and the
correct attack by the bow in which the major of pupil ar
defici if the violin is not held at the proper angl for instanc
it is just as though a piano were to stand on a slope floor too mani
student plai with the violin on the bow instead of hold the
violin steadi and let the bow plai
and in begin to studi thi appar simpl yet fundament
import principl is often overlook or neglect joachim when he
studi as a tenyearold boi under hellmesberg in vienna onc plai
a part in a concerto by maurer for four violin and piano hi teacher
wa displeas youll never be a fiddler he told him you us your
bow too stiffli but the boi father took him to bhm and he remain
with thi teacher for three year until hi fundament fault wa
complet overcom and if joachim had not given hi concentr
attent to hi bow while there wa still time he would never have
been the great artist he later becam
the art of the bow
you see he continu the secret of realli beauti violin plai
li in the bow a blondin cross niagara find hi wire hard and firm
where he first step on it but as he progress it vibrat with
increas intens and as the tightrop walker know how to control
the vibrat of hi wire so the violinist must master the vibrat
of hi string each section of the string vibrat with a differ
qualiti of tone most pupil think that a big tone is develop by
pressur with the bowyet much depend on what part of the string thi
pressur is appli finger is an art of cours but the great art
is the art of the bow the art of bow as tartini call it when a
pupil understand it he ha gone far
everi pupil mai be develop to a certain degre without ever
suspect how import a factor the manipul of the bow will be in
hi further progress he think that if the finger of hi left hand ar
agil he ha gain the main end in view but then he come to a
stophi left hand can no longer aid him and he find that if he want
to plai with real beauti of express the bow suppli the onli true
kei out of a hundr who reach thi stage mr kneisel went on rather
sadli onli some five or six or even less becom great artist thei
ar those who ar abl to control the bow as well as the left hand all
real art begin with phrase and thi too li altogeth in the
masteri of bowth veri soul of the violin
i ask mr kneisel how he came to write hi own advanc exercis
for the instrument i had an idea that a set of studi in which each
singl studi present a varieti of technic figur might be a relief
from the exercis in so mani excel method where page of scale
ar follow by page of arpeggio page of doublenot and so forth
it is veri monoton to practic page and page of a singl technic
figur he ad most pupil simpli will not do it he brought out a
copi of hi exercis and show me their plan here for instanc i
have scale trill arpeggiosal in the same studi and the studi is
conceiv as a music composit instead of a technic formula thi
is a studi in finger posit with all possibl bow my aim ha
been to concentr the technic materi of a whole violin school in
a set of tude with music interest
and he show me the second book of the studi in ms contain
exercis in everi varieti of scale and trill bow nuanc etc
combin in a singl music movement thi volum also contain hi own
cadenza to the beethoven violin concerto in conclus mr kneisel laid
stress on the import of the student hear the best music at
concert and recit as often as possibl and on the valu and incent
suppli by a music atmospher in the home and on leav him i
could not help but feel that what he had said in our interview hi
reflect and observ base on an artistri beyond cavil and an
authorit experi would be well worth ponder by everi seriou
student of the instrument for franz kneisel speak of what he know

adolfo betti
the technic of the modern quartet
what lover of chamber music in it more perfect dispens is not
familiar with the figur of adolfo betti the guid brain and bow of
the flonzalei quartet born in florenc he plai hi first public
concert at the ag of six yet as a youth found it hard to choos
between literatur for which he had decid aptitudea and music
fortun for american concert audienc of todai he final
inclin to the latter an expon of what mani consid the greatest
of all violinist school the belgian he studi for four year with
csar thomson at lige spent four more concert in vienna and
elsewher and return to thomson as the latter assist in the
brussel conservatori three year befor he join the flonzalei in
1903 with pleasant recollect of earlier meet with thi gift
artist the writer sought him out and found him amiabl will to talk
about the modern quartet and it ideal ideal which he person ha
done so much to realiz
footnot a m betti ha publish a number of critic articl in the
guid music of brussel the rivista musical of turin etc
the modern quartet
you ask me how the modern quartet differ from it predecessor said
mr betti it differ in mani wai for on thing the modern quartet
ha develop in a wai that make it inner voicessecond violin and
violamuch more import than thei us to be origin as in
haydn earli quartet we have a violin solo with three accompani
instrument in beethoven last quartet the intermedi voic have
alreadi gain a freedom and individu which befor him had not even
been suspect in these last quartet beethoven ha alreadi set forth
the principl which wa to becom the basi of modern polyphoni first
of all to allow each voic to express itself freeli and fulli and
afterward to see what the relat were of on to the other in
fact no on ha exercis a more revolutionari effect on the quartet
than beethovenno on ha made it attain so great a degre of
progress and sure the distanc separ the quartet as beethoven
found it from the quartet as he left it grand fugu op 131 op
132 is greater than that which li between the fugu op 132 and the
most advanc modern quartet let us sai for instanc schnberg op
7 schnberg by the wai ha onli appli and develop the principl
establish by beethoven in the latter last quartet but in the
modern quartet we have a new element on which tend more and more to
becom preponder and which might be call orchestr rather than
da camera smetana grieg tschaikovski were the first to follow thi
path in which the major of the modern includ franck and
debussi have follow them and in addit mani among the most
advanc modern compos strive for orchestr effect that often lie
outsid the natur capabl of the string
illustr adolfo betti with handwritten note
for instanc stravinski in the first of hi three impressionist
sketch for quartet which we have plai ha the first violin plai
ponticello throughout not the natur ponticello but a quit
special on to produc an effect of a bagpip sound at a distanc
i had to try again and again till i found the right technic mean to
produc the effect desir then the cello is us to imit the
drum there ar special technic problem for the second violina
singl sustain d with an accompani pizzicato on the open
stringswhil the viola is requir to suggest the tramp of march
feet and again in other modern quartet we find special technic
devic undreamt of in earlier dai borodin for instanc is the
first to systemat emploi success of harmon in the trio of
hi first quartet the melodi is success introduc by the cello
and the first violin altogeth in harmon
the modern quartet and amateur player
you ask me whether the averag quartet of amateur of lover of string
music can get much out of the more modern quartet i would sai ye
but with some seriou reserv there ha been much beauti music
written but most of it is complic in the case of the older
quartet haydn mozart etc even if thei ar not plai well the
perform can still obtain an idea of the music of it thought
content but in the modern quartet unless each individu player ha
master everi technic difficulti the music idea doe not pierc
through there is no effect
i rememb when we rehears the first schnberg quartet it wa in
1913 at a chicago hotel and we had no score but onli the separ
part the result at our first attempt were so dread that we
stop after a few page it wa not till i had secur a score
studi it and again tri it that we began to see a light final
there wa not on measur which we did not understand but schnberg
reger ravel quartet make too great a demand on the technic abil
of the averag quartet amateur
the technic of quartet plai
natur the first violin is the leader the conductor of the
quartet as in it earli dai although the star system with on
virtuos player and three satellit ha disappear now the quartet
as a whole ha establish itself in the virtuoso fieldus the
word virtuoso in it best sens the mller quartet hanov
18451850 wa the first to travel as a chamber music organ and
the famou florentin quartet the first to realiz what could be
done in the wai of finish in plai as premier violinist of the
flonzalei i studi and prepar the interpret of the work we ar
to plai befor ani rehears is done
while the first violin still hold first place in the modern quartet
the second violin ha becom much more import than formerli it ha
gain in individu in mani of the newer quartet it is quit as
import as the first in hugo wolf quartet for exampl first and
second violin ar emploi as though in a concerto for two violin
the viola especi in modern french worksravel debussi
samazeuilha a promin part in the older quartet on reason the
viola part ar simpl is becaus the alto player as a rule were
technic less skill as a gener thing thei were violinist who
had failedth refuge of the g clef as edouard colonn the
emin conductor onc wittili said but the reason modern french
compos give the viola special attent is becaus franc now is
ahead of the other nation in virtuos viola plai it is practic
the onli countri which mai be said to have a school of viola plai
in the smetana quartet the viola plai a most import part and
dvork who himself plai viola emphas the instrument in hi
quartet
mozart show what the cello wa abl to do in the quartet he
dedic to the cellist king frederick william of prussia and
then the cello ha alwai the music import which attach to it
as the lower of the two outer voic of the quartet ensembl like
the second violin and viola it ha experienc a technic and music
develop beyond anyth haydn or mozart would have dare to write
rehears
realiz of the art aim of the modern quartet call for endless
rehears few peopl realiz the hard work and concentr effort
entail and there ar alwai new problem to solv after prepar a
new score in advanc we meet and establish it gener idea it broad
outlin in actual plai and then gradual we fill in the detail
ordinarili we rehears three hour a dai less dure the concert
season of cours but alwai enough to keep absolut in trim and we
vari our practic program in order to keep mental fresh as well as
technic fit
inton
perfect inton is a great problemon practic unknown to the
averag amateur quartet player four player mai each on of them be
plai in tune in pitch yet their chord mai not be truli in tune
becaus of the individu biasa trifl sharp a trifl flatin
interpret pitch thi individu bia mai be caus by the attract
exist between certain note by differ of regist and timbr
or ani number of other reasonstoo mani to recount the true beauti of
the quartet tone cannot be obtain unless there is an exact adjust
a temper of the individu pitch of each instrument till perfect
accord exist thi is far more difficult and complic than on
might at first believ for exampl let us take on of the simplest
violin chord said mr betti and he rapidli set it down in pencil
illustr music notat
now let us begin by fix the b so that it is perfectli in tune with
the e then without at all chang the b take the interv db you
will see that the sixth will not be in tune repeat the experi
invert the note the result will still be the same try it yourself
some time ad mr betti with a smile and you will see what is the
reason it is becaus the middl b ha not been adjust temper give
the same note to the first and second violin and the viola and you
will have the same result then when the cello is ad the problem
is still more complic ow to the differ in timbr and
regist yet it is a problem which can be solv and is solv in
practic everyth we plai
anoth difficulti especi in the case of some of the veri dare
chord encount in modern composit is the matter of balanc
between the individu note there ar chord which onli sound well
if certain note ar thrown into relief and other onli if plai veri
softli almost as though thei were overton to overcom such
difficulti mean a great deal of work real music instinct and
abov all great familiar with the compos harmon process yet
with time and patienc the true balanc of tone can be obtain
tempo
all four individu player must be abl to feel the tempo thei ar
plai in the same wai i believ it wa mahler who onc gave out a
beat veri distinctlyon two threetold hi orchestra player to
count the beat silent for twenti measur and then stop as each
felt the beat differ from the other everi on of them stop at
a differ time so tempo just like inton must be temper
by the four quartet player in order to secur perfect rhythmic
inflect
dynam
modern compos have wonderfulli improv dynam express everi
littl shade of mean thei make clear with great distinct the
older compos and occasion a modern like emanuel moor do not us
express mark moor sai if the perform realli have someth to
put into my work the sign ar not need yet thi ha it
disadvantag i onc had an entir unmark sonata by sammartini as
most first movement in the sonata of that compos ar allegro i
tri the begin sever time as an allegro but it sound
radic wrong then at last it occur to me to try it as a largo
and behold it wa beauti
interpret
if the leader of the quartet ha live himself into and master a
composit togeth with hi associ the result is sure i must
live in the music i plai just as an actor must live the charact he
repres all higher interpret depend on solv technic
problem in a wai which is not narrowli mechan and while the
ensembl spirit must be preserv the freedom of the individu
should not be too much restrain onc the style and manner of a modern
compos ar familiar it is easier to present hi work when we first
plai the reger quartet here some twenti year ago we found page
which at first we could not at all understand if on ha fathom
debussi it is easier to plai milhaud rogerducass samazeuilfor the
music of the modern french school ha much in common on great cultur
valu the profession quartet ha for the music commun is the fact
that it give a larg circl a measur of acquaint with the mode of
thought and style of compos whose symphon and larger work ar
often an unknown quantiti thi appli to debussi reger the modern
russian bloch and other when we plai the stravinski piec here
for instanc hi ptrouschka and firebird had not yet been heard
some ideal
we try as an organ to be absolut cathol in tast nor do
we neglect the older music becaus we plai so much of the new thi
year we ar devot special attent to the american compos
formerli the kneisel took care of them and now we feel that we should
assum thi legaci we have alreadi plai daniel gregori mason fine
intermezzo and the other american number we have plai includ
david stanlei smith second quartet and movement from quartet by

martin loeffler rhapsodi for viola obo and piano
i have been for some time make a collect of sonata a tre two

sonata in d minor we have plai some three hundr time and it slow

han letz
the technic of bow
han letz the gift alsatian violinist is well fit to talk on ani
phase of hi art a pupil of joachim he came to thi countri in 1908
he wa for three year concertmast of the thoma orchestra appear
as a solo artist in most of our larg citi and wa not onli on of
the kneisel he join that organ in 1912 but the leader of a
quartet of hi own as a teacher too he is activ in give other an
opportun to appli the lesson of hi own experi
violin masteri
when ask for hi definit of the term mr letz said there can be
no such thing as an absolut masteri of the violin masteri is a
rel term the artist is first of all more or less depend on
circumst which he cannot controlhi mood the weather string
a thousand and on incident and then the nearer he get to hi
ideal the more apt hi ideal is to escap him yet discount all
object i should sai that a master should be abl to express
perfectli the compos idea reflect by hi own sensit soul
the kei to interpret
the bow is the kei to thi masteri in express in interpret in
a lesser degre the left hand the averag pupil doe not realiz thi
but believ that mere finger facil is the whole gist of technic yet
the richest color the most delic nuanc is mainli a matter of
bow in the left hand of cours the vibrato give a certain
amount of color effect the intens dramat tone qualiti of the rapid
vibrato is compar on the violin to the tremulando of the singer
at the same time the vibrato us to excess is quit as bad as an
excess tremulando in the voic but control of the bow is the kei
to the gate of the great field of declam it is the mean of
articul and accent it give charact compris the entir scale
of the emot in fact declam with the violin bow is veri much
like declam in dramat art and the attack of the bow on the
string should be as incis as the utter of the first accent
syllabl of a spoken word the bow is emphat the mean of
express but onli the advanc pupil can develop it finer more
delic expression possibl
the technic of bow
geniu doe mani thing by instinct and it sometim happen that veri
great perform try to explain some technic function do not know
how to make their mean clear with regard to bow i rememb that
joachim a master colorist with the bow us to tell hi student to
plai larg with the wrist what he realli meant wa with an
elbowjoint movement that is move the bow which should alwai be
connect with a movement of the forearm by mean of the elbowjoint
the ideal bow stroke result from keep the joint of the right arm
loos and at the same time firm enough to control each motion made a
difficult thing for the student is to learn to draw the bow across the
string at a right angl the onli wai to produc a good tone i find
it help my pupil to tell them not to think of the posit of the
bowarm while draw the bow across the string but mere to follow
with the tip of the finger of the right hand an imaginari line run
at a right angl across the string the whole bow then move as it
should and the arm motion unconsci adjust themselv
rhythm and color
rhythm is the foundat of all musicnot rhythm in it metronom
sens but in the broader sens of proport i lai the greatest stress
on the develop of rhythmic sensibl in the student rhythm give
life to everi music phrase mr letz had a brahm quartet open on
hi music stand plai the follow passag he said
illustr music notat
in order to give thi phrase it proper rhythmic valu to express it
clearli plastic there must be a veri slight separ between the
sixteenth and the eighthnot follow them thisth bow pick up a
trifl from the stringsthrow the sixteenth into relief as i have
alreadi said tone color is for the main part control by the bow if
i draw the bow abov the fingerboard instead of keep it near the
bridg i have a decid contrast in color thi color contrast mai
alwai be establish plai near the bridg result in a clear and
sharp tone plai near the fingerboard in a veil and velveti on
suggest in teach
i find that asid from the person illustr absolut necessari
when teach that an appeal to the pupil imagin usual bear
fruit in develop tonequ let us sai i tell the pupil hi
phrase should have a golden mellow color the tonal equival of the
hue of the sunris i vari my pictur accord to the circumst
and the pupil in most case react to them in fast bow for
instanc i make three color distinct or rather sound distinct
there is the color of rain when a fast bow is push gentli over the
string while not allow to jump the color of snowflak produc
when the hair of the bow alwai touch the string and the wood danc
and the color of hail which seldom occur in the classic when in
the real characterist spiccato the whole bow leav the string
the art and the school
in repli to anoth question mr letz ad great violin plai is
great violin plai irrespect of school or nation of cours
the belgian and french have notabl eleg polish finish in detail
the french lai stress on sensuou beauti of tone the german tempera
is perhap broader neglect sensuou beauti for beauti of idea

david mann
the philosophi of violin teach
that david mann the wellknown violinist and conductor so long
director of the new york music school settlement would be abl to speak
in an interest and authorit manner on hi art wa a foregon
conclus in the writer mind a visit to the educ own beauti
music school confirm thi convict in repli to some question
concern hi own studi year mr mann spoke of hi work with
heinrich de ahna karl halir and eugn ysay when i came to de ahna
in berlin i wa unfortun not yet readi for him and so did not
get much benefit from hi instruct in the case of halir to whom i
went later i wa in much better shape to take advantag of what he
could give me and profit accordingli it is a point ani student mai
well notethat when he think of studi with some famou teacher
he be technic and music equip to take advantag of all that
the latter mai be abl to give him otherwis it is a case of love
labor lost on the part of both karl halir wa a sincer and veri
thorough teacher he wa a spohr player par excel and i have
never found hi equal in the plai of spohr gesangsscen with him
i studi kreutzer rode fiorillo and to know halir as a teacher wa
to know him at hi best sinc as a public performergreat violinist as
he wash did not do himself justic becaus he wa too nervou and
highstrung
illustr david mann with handwritten note
studi with ysay
it wa while sit among the first violin in the new york symphoni
orchestra that i first heard ysay and for the first time in my life i
heard a man with whom i fervent want to studi an artist whose
whole attitud with regard to tone and sound reproduct embodi my
ideal
i work with ysay in brussel and in hi cottag at godinn here he
taught much as liszt did at weimar a group of from ten to twenti
discipl earli in the morn he went fish in the meus then back
to breakfast and then came the lesson not more than three or four a
dai those who studi drew inspir from him as the pianist of the
weimar circl did from their master in fact ysay standpoint toward
music had a good deal in common with rubinstein and he often said he
wish he could plai the violin as rubinstein did the piano ysay is an
artist who ha transcend hi own mediumh ha becom a poet of
sound and unless the on studi with him could understand and
appreci thi fact he made a poor teacher but to me in all humil
he wa and will alwai remain a wonder inspir as an influenc
in my career hi marvel geniu is uniqu in my own teach i have
onli to recal hi tone hi plai in hi littl cottag on the bank
of the meus which the tide of war ha swept awai to realiz in a
cumul sens the thing he tri to make plain to me then ysay
taught the technic of express as against the express of technic
he gave the lesson of a thousand teacher in place of the lesson of
on the greatest technic develop wa requir by ysay of a
pupil and given thi prerequisit he could open up to him ever
enlarg horizon of music beauti
nor did he think that the true beauti of violin plai must depend
upon six to eight hour of daili practic work i absolut believ
with ysay that unless a student can make satisfactori progress with
three hour of practic a dai he should not attempt to plai the violin
inabl to do so is in itself a confess of failur at the outset
nor do i think it possibl to practic the violin intens more than
threequart of an hour at a time in order to util hi three hour
of practic to the best advantag the student should divid them into
four period with interv of rest between each and these rest
period might simpli repres a transfer of energywhich is a rest in
itselfto read or some other occup not necessarili german to
music yet like to stimul interest in some other art
some initi principl of violin studi
the violin student first and foremost should accustom himself to
practic pure technic exercis without note the scale and
arpeggio should never be plai otherwis and book of scale should be
us onli as a refer quit as import as scale practic ar
broken chord on the violin these cannot be plai solidli as on the
piano but must be studi as arpeggio in the most exhaust wai
harmon and technic their great valu li in develop an
innat music sens in establish an idea of tonal and harmoni
that becom so deepli root that everi other kei is as natur to the
player as is the kei of c work of thi kind can never be done ideal
in class but everi individu student must himself come to realiz the
necess of do technic work without note as a matter of daili
exercis even though hi time be limit perhap the most difficult of
all lesson is learn to hold the violin there ar pupil to whom
hold the instrument present insurmount obstacl such pupil
instead of struggl in vain with a physic difficulti might rather
take up the studi of the cello whose weight rest on the floor that
mani a student wa not intend to be a violin player by natur is
prove by the variou invent chinrest brace intend to suppli
what natur ha not suppli the studi of the violin should never be
allow if it is go to result in actual physic deform rais
of the left shoulder malform of the back or erupt result
from chinrest pressur these ar all evid of physic unfit
or of incorrect teach
the philosophi of violin teach
class studi is for the advanc student not the beginn in the
begin onli the closest person contact between the individu pupil
and the teacher is desir to borrow an analog from natur the
student mai be compar to the young bird whose untrain wing will not
allow him to take ani trial flight unaid by hi natur guardian for
the begin violinist the princip thing to do is to learn the voic
place of the violin thi goe hand in hand with the properwhich is
the easi and naturalmann of hold the violin bow studi and an
appreci of the acoust of the instrument the student attent
should at onc be call to the marvel and manifold qualiti of the
violin tone and he should at onc familiar himself with the
develop of those contrast of stress and pressur eas and
relax which ar instrument in it product the analog
between the violin voic and the human voic should also be develop
the violin itself must to all intent becom a part of the player
himself just as the vocal chord ar part of the human bodi it should
not be consid a foreign toneproduc instrument adjust to the
bodi of the perform but an extens a project of hi physic
self in a wai it is easier for the violinist to get at the chord of
the violin and make them sound sinc thei ar all expos which is not
the case with the singer
there ar two danger point in presentdai standard of violin
teach on is repres by the veri effici european profession
standard of technic which mai result in an absolut failur of poetic
music comprehens these should not be transplant here from
european soil the other is the nontechn sentiment formless
speci of teach which can onli result in emot enerv yet
if forc to choos between the two the former would be prefer sinc
without tool it is imposs to carv anyth of beauti the final
beauti of the violin tone the pure legato remain in the begin
as in the end a matter of hold the violin and bow togeth thei
place the tone just as the physic media in the throat place the
tone of the voic
piano teacher have made greater advanc in the tone develop
technic of their instrument than the violin teacher on reason is
that as a class thei ar more intellectu and then too violin
teach is regard too often as a mystic art an occult scienc and
on into which onli those special gift mai hope to be initi
thi it seem to me is a fallaci just as a gift for mathemat is a
special talent not given to all so a natur technic talent exist
in rel few peopl yet thi doe not impli that the major ar
shut off from plai the violin and plai it well ani student who
ha music in hi soul mai be taught to plai simpl and even rel
more difficult music with beauti beauti of express and
interpret thi he mai be taught to do even though not endow with
a natur technic facil for the violin a proof that natur
technic facil is anyth but a guarante of higher musicianship is
shown in that the music weak of mani brilliant violinist hidden
by the technic elabor of virtuoso piec is onli appar when
thei attempt to plai a beethoven adagio or a simpl mozart rondo
in a number of case the unsuccess solo player ha a bad effect on
violin teach usual the soloist who ha not made a success as a
concert artist take up teach as a last resort without enthusiasm or
the true vocat instinct the fals standard he set up for hi
pupil ar a natur result of hi own ineffectu worship of the fetish
of virtuositythos of the music mountebank of a hundr year ago
of cours such fals prophet of the virtuos have noth in common
with such highpriest of public utter as ysay kreisler and
other whose virtuos is a true mean for the higher develop of
the music the encourag of musicianship in gener suffer for
the stress laid on what is obvious technic impedimenta but more
and more as time pass the plai of such artist as those alreadi
mention and other like them show that the real musician is the
lover of beauti sound which technic mere develop in the highest
degre
todai technic in a cumul sens often is a confess of failur
for technic doe not do what it so often claim toproduc the artist
most profession teach aim to prepar the student for profession
life the concert stage henc there is an intens technic studi
of composit that even if not wholli intend for displai ar
primarili and princip project for it sake it is a wellknown
fact that few even among gift player can sit down to plai chamber
music and do it justic thi is not becaus thei cannot grasp or
understand it or becaus their technic is insuffici it is becaus
their whole violinist educ ha been along the line of solo
plai thei have liter been brought up not to plai with other
but to be accompani by other
yet despit all thi there ha been a notabl develop of violin
studi in the direct of ensembl work with as a result an attitud
on the part of the violinist cultiv it of greater humil as
regard music in gener a greater appreci of the charm of
artist collabor andi insista technic both finer and more
flexibl chamber musicorigin music written for the intim
surround of the home for a small circl of listenerscarri out
in it inform wai mani of the ideal of the larger orchestr
ensembl and as regard the violinist he is not depend onli on
the literatur of the string quartet there ar piano quintet and
quartet piano trio and the duo for violin and piano some of the
most beauti instrument thought of the classic and modern
compos ar to be found in the duo for violin and piano mainli in the
sonata form amateursviolinist who love music for it own sake and
have suffici facil to perform such work creditablydo not do
nearli enough ensembl plai with a pianist it is not alwai
possibl to get togeth the four player need for the string quartet
but a pianist is apt to be more readili found
the combin of violin and piano is as a rule obtain and the
literatur is particularli rich asid from sonata by corelli
locatelli tartini bach mozart beethoven haendel brahm and
schumann nearli all the romant and modern compos have contribut
to it and thi music ha all been written so as to show the charact
of each instrument at it bestth piano harmon in it natur the
violin a natur melod voic capabl of everi shade of nuanc
that mr mann as an artist ha made a point of practic what he
preach to the student as regard the ensembl of violin and piano
will be recal by all who have enjoi the sonata recit he ha
given togeth with mr mann and as an interpret solo artist hi
view regard the moot question of gut versu wire string ar of
interest
gut versu wire string
my own violin a maggini of more than the usual size date from the
year 1600 it formerli belong to dr leopold damrosch which string
do i us on it the whole question as to whether gut or wire string ar
to be prefer mai in my opinion be refer to the violin itself for
decis what i mean is that if stradivariu guarneriu amati
maggini and other of the oldmast builder of violin had ever had
wire string in view thei would have built their fiddl in accord
and thei would not be the same we now possess first of all there ar
scientif reason against us the wire string thei chang the tone
of the instrument the rigid of tension of the wire e string where it
cross the bridg tighten up the sound of the lower string their
advantag ar reliabl under advers climat condit and the
incontest fact that thei make thing easier technic thei
facilit puriti of inton yet i am will to forgo these
advantag when i consid the wonder pliabil of the gut string
for which stradivariu built hi violin i can see the artist
retrogress of those who ar us the wire e for when materi
thing ar made easier spiritu there is a loss
chin rest
and while we ar discuss the physic aspect of the instrument
there is the chin rest none of the great violin maker ever made a
chin rest increas technic demand sudden pyrotechn flight
into the higher octav brought the chin rest into be the chin
rest wa meant to give the player a better grasp of hi instrument i
absolut disapprov in theori of chin rest cushion or pad
technic reason mai be adduc to justifi their us never artist
on i admit that progress in violin studi is infinit slower without
the us of the pad but the more close and direct a contact with hi
instrument the player can develop the more intim express hi
plai becom student with long neck and thin bodi claim thei
have to us a chin rest but the studi of physic adjust could
bring about a better cordin between them and the instrument a
thin pad mai be us without much danger yet i feel that the thicker
and higher the chin rest the greater the loss in express render
the more we accustom ourselv to mechan aid the more we will come
to reli on them but the question you ask anent violin masteri
lead altogeth awai from the materi
violin masteri
to me it signifi technic effici coupl with poetic insight
freedom from convention accept standard the attain of a more
vari person express along individu line it mai be realiz
of cours onli to a degre sinc the possessor of absolut violin
masteri would be forev glorifi as it is the violin master as i
conceiv him repres the embodi of the greatest intimaci between
himself the artist and hi medium of express consid in thi
light pablo casal and hi cello perhap most close compli with the
requir of the definit and thi is not as paradox as it mai
seem sinc all string instrument ar brethren descend from the
ancient viol and the cello is after all a variant of the violin

the begin of a violinist career plai with liszt
no lonard wa not my first teacher i took up violin work when a boi
of five year of ag and for seven year practic from eight to ten
hour a dai studi with sabathiel the leader of the royal orchestra
in budapest where i wa born though england the land of my adopt
in which i have live these last twentysix year is the land where i
have found all my happi and much gratifi honor and of which i
have been a devot ardent and loyal natur citizen for more than
a quarter of a centuri sabathiel wa an excel routin teacher and
ground me well in the fundamentalsgood tone product and
technic control later i had far greater teacher and thei taught me
much butin the last analysi most of the littl i have achiev i
ow to myself to hard untir work i had determin to be a
violinist and i trust i becam on no seriou student of the instrument
should ever forget that no matter who hi teacher mai be he himself
must suppli the determin the continu energi and devot which
will lead him to success
plai with liszth wa an intim friend of my fatheri my most
preciou music recollect of budapest i enjoi it a great deal
more than my regular lesson work he would condescend to plai with me
some even and you can imagin what rare music enjoy what
happi there wa in plai with such a geniu i wa still a boi
when with him i plai the grieg f major sonata which had just come
fresh from the press he plai with me the d minor sonata of schumann
and introduc me to the mystic beauti of the beethoven sonata i can
still recal how in the beethoven c minor sonata in the first movement
liszt would bring out a certain broken chromat passag in the left
hand with a mighti crescendo an effect of melodi thunder of
enorm depth of tone and yet with the most exquisit regard for the
balanc between the violin and hi own instrument and there wa not a
trace of condescens in hi attitud toward me but alwai
encourag a tender affection and patern interest in a young
boi who at that moment wa a brother artist
through liszt i came to know the great men of hungarian music of that
time erkel han richter robert volkmann count geza zichi and
eventu i secur a scholarship which the king had found for
music to studi with joachim in berlin where i remain nearli three
year hubai wa my companion there but afterward we separ he
go to vieuxtemp while i went to lonard
joachim as a teacher and interpret
joachim wa perhap the most celebr teacher of hi time yet it
is on of the greatest ironi of fate that when he di there wa not
on of hi pupil who wa consid by the german author great
enough to take the place the master had held henri marteau who wa
not hi pupil and did not even exemplifi hi style in plai wa
chosen to succe him henri petri a vieuxtemp pupil who went to
joachim plai just as well when he came to him as when he left him
the same might be said of willi burmest hess ke and halir the
latter on of those bohemian artist who had a tremend kubeliklik
execut teach is and alwai will be a special gift there ar mani
minor artist who ar wonder teacher and vice versa
yet if joachim mai be critic as regard the wai of impart the
secret of technic phase in hi violin teach as a teacher of
interpret he wa incompar as an interpret of beethoven and
of bach in particular there ha never been ani on to equal joachim
yet he never plai the same bach composit twice in the same wai we
were four in our class and hubai and i us to bring our copi of the
sonata with us to make margin note while joachim plai to us and
these instantan music snapshot remain veri interest but no
matter how joachim plai bach it wa alwai with a big tone broad
chord of an organlik effect there is no greater discrep than the
edit of the bach sonata publish sinc hi death by moser and
which is suppos to embodi joachim interpret sweep chord
which joachim alwai plai with the utmost breadth ar arpeggi
in moser edit why if ani of hi pupil had ever attempt to
plai for instanc the end of the bour in the b minor partita of
bach la moser joachim would have broken hi bow over their head
studi with lonard
after three year studi i left joachim and went to pari liszt had
given me letter of introduct to variou french artist among them
saintsan on even i happen to hear lonard plai corelli la
folia in the sall pleyel and the liquid clariti and beauti of hi
tone so impress me that i decid i must studi with him i plai for
him and he accept me as a pupil i am free to admit that my tone
which peopl seem to be pleas to prais especi i ow entir to
lonard for when i came to him i had the socal german tone son
allemand of a harsh rasp qualiti which i tri to abandon
absolut lonard often would point to hi ear while teach and
sai ouvrez vo oreil coutz la beaut du son open your
ear listen for beauti of sound most joachim pupil you hear
unless thei have reform attack a chord with the nut of the bow the
german method which unduli stress the attack lonard on the
contrari insist with hi pupil on the attack be made with such
smooth as to be absolut unobtrus be a nephew of mme
malibran he attach special import to the sing tone and
advis hi pupil to hear great singer to listen to them and to
try and reproduc their bel canto on the violin
he wa most particular in hi observ of everi nuanc of shade
and express he told me that when he plai mendelssohn concerto
for the first time at the leipsic gewandhau at a rehears
mendelssohn himself conduct he began the first phrase with a full
mezzofort tone mendelssohn laid hi hand on hi arm and said but
it begin piano in repli lonard mere point with hi bow to the
scoreth p which is now indic in all edit had been omit
by some printer error and he had been quit within hi right in
plai mezzofort
lonard paid a great deal of attent to scale and the right wai to
practic them he would sai il faut filer le son cest lart de
matr on must spin out the tone that is the art of the
master he taught hi pupil to plai the scale with long steadi
bow count sixti to each bow himself a great classic
violinist he nevertheless paid a good deal of attent to virtuoso
piec and alwai tri to prepar hi pupil for public life he had
all sort of wise hint for the bud concert artist and wa in the
habit of sai you must plan a program as you would the mnu of a
dinner there should be someth for everi on tast and
especi if you ar plai on a long program togeth with other
artist offer noth indigestiblelet your number be a relief
sivori
while studi with lonard i met sivori paganini onli pupil if we
except catarina caleagno for whom paganini wrote a concerto and six
short sonata lonard took me to see him late on even at the htel
de havan in pari where sivori wa stai when we came to hi room
we heard the sound of slow scale beautifulli plai come from
behind the close door we peer through the keyhol and there he sat
on hi bed string hi scale tone like pearl he wa a littl chap
and had the tiniest hand i have ever seen wa thi a drawback if so
no on could tell from hi plai he had a flawless technic and a
realli pearli qualiti of tone he wa veri jolli and amiabl and he and
lonard were great friend each alwai go to hear the other whenev
he plai in concert my four year in pari were in the main year of
storm and stressplain live and hard veri hard concentr work i
gave some accompani lesson to help keep thing go when i left
pari i went to london and then began my public life as a concert
violinist
great moment in an artist life
what is the happiest remembr of my career as a virtuoso some of

wa invit by richter to go with him to bayreuth and plai at the
foundat of the bayreuth festiv theater which howev my parent
would not permit ow to my tender ag i also rememb with pleasur
an episod at the famou pasdeloup concert in the cirqu dhiver in

the third time and thenth e string snap i do not think ani
other than saras could have carri off these success mishap and
brought hi concert to a triumphant conclus he wa a great friend of

maximilian pilzer
the sing tone and the vibrato
maximilian pilzer is deservedli promin among younger american concert
violinist a pupil of joachim shradieck gustav holland he is as
it ha alreadi been picturesqu put a graduat of the rock and thorn
univers an artist who ow hi success mainli to hi own natur
gift plu an infinit capac for take pain though primarili an
interpret hi interlocutor yet had the good fortun to happen on mr
pilzer when he wa give a lesson essenti a solo violinist mr
pilzer nevertheless ha the born teacher wish to impart to share
where talent justifi it hi own knowledg he himself did not have to
tell the listen thisth lesson he wa give betrai the fact
it wa kreisler tambourin chinoi that the student plai and as
mr pilzer illustr the delic shade of nuanc of phrase of
bow with instant rebuk for an occasion lack of warmth in tone
the improv wa instantan and unmistak the lesson over he
said
the sing tone
the sing tone is the ideal on it is the natur violin tone too
mani violin student have the technic bee in their bonnet and neglect
it and too mani believ that speed is brillianc when thei see the
black note thei take for grant that thei must run to beat the band
yet often it is the teacher fault if a good sing tone is not
develop where the teacher plai is cold that of the pupil is apt
to be the same warmth round full the truli beauti violin
tone is more difficult to call forth than is gener suppos and in
a manner of speak the soul of thi tone qualiti is the vibrato
though the individu instrument also ha much to do with the tone
the vibrato
but not mr pilzer continu not as it is too often mistakenli
emploi of cours ani train player will draw hi bow across the
string in a smooth even wai but that is not enough there must be an
inner emot instinct an electr spark within the player himself
that set the vibrato current in motion it is an inner psychic
vibrat which should be reflect by the intens rapid vibrat in
the finger of the left hand on the string in order to give fluent
express to emot the vibrato can not be us natur on the
open string but otherwis it repres the true mean for secur
warmth of express of cours some decri the vibratobut the
reason is often becaus the vibrato is too slow on need onli listen
to ysay elman kreisler artist such as these emploi the quick
intens vibrato with ideal effect an exagger vibrato is as bad
as what i call the sentiment slide a common fault which mani
violinist cultiv under the impress that thei ar plai
express
violin masteri and it attain
violin masteri express more or less the aspir to realiz an
ideal it is a hope a prayer rather than an actual fact sinc noth
human is absolut perfect ysay perhap with hi golden tone come
nearest to my idea of what violin masteri should be both as regard
breadth and delicaci of interpret and guidepost along the long
road that lead to masteri of the instrument individu in teach
progress along natur line sureti in bow a toneproduct
without forc cultiv a sens of rhythm and accent i alwai
rememb what moser onc wrote in my autograph album rhythm and accent
ar the soul of music
the shine goal
and what a shine goal is wait to be reach the correct
interpret of bach haendel and the old italian and french classic
and of the vast realm of ensembl music under which head come the
mozart and beethoven violin sonata and those of their successor
schumann brahm etc and asid from the classic the modern and
then there ar the great violin concerto in a class by themselv
thei repres in a degre the utmost that the compos ha done for
the interpret artist yet thei differ absolut in manner style
thought etc take joachim own hungarian concerto which i plai for
the compos of which i still treasur the recollect of hi pat
me on the shoulder and sai there is noth for me to correct it
is a work deliber design for technic displai and is
tremend difficult but the wonder brahm concerto those of
beethoven and max bruch of mozart and mendelssohnit is hard to
express a prefer for work so differ in the qualiti of their
beauti the russian conu ha a fine concerto in e and sind a most
effect on in a major edmund severn the american compos and
violinist ha also written a notabl fine violin concerto which i have
plai with the philharmon on that ought to be heard often
plai bach
bach is on of the most difficult of the great master to interpret on
the violin hi polyphon style and interweav theme demand close
studi in order to make the mean clear in the bach chaconn for
instanc some veri great violinist do not pai enough attent to
make a distinct between princip and secondari note of a chord
here mr pilzer took up a new strad he ha recent acquir and
illustr hi mean in thi fournot chord there is on import
melodi note which must stand out and it can be done though not without
some studi bach abound in such pitfal and in studi him the
closest attent is necessari onc the problem involv overcom hi
music gain it true clariti and beauti and the enjoy of artist and

maud powel
technic difficulti some hint
for the concert player
maud powel is often allud to as our repres american woman
violinist which while true in a narrow sens is not altogeth just
in a broader wai it would be decidedli more fair to consid her a
repres american violinist without stress the term woman
for as regard art in it higher sens the artist come first sex
be incident and maud powel is first and foremostan artist and
her infinit capac for take pain her willing to work hard
have had no small part in the posit she ha made for herself and the
success she ha achiev
the develop of a concert violinist
too mani american who take up the violin profession maud powel
told the writer do not realiz that the masteri of the instrument is
a life studi that without hard concentr work thei cannot reach the
higher level of their art then too thei ar too often inclin to
think that if thei have a good tone and technic that thi is all thei
need thei forget that the music instinct must be cultiv thei do
not attach enough import to music surround to hear and
understand music of everi kind not onli that written for the violin
thei do not realiz the valu of ensembl work and it influenc as an
educ factor of the greatest artist valu i rememb when i wa
a girl of eight my mother us to plai the mozart violin sonata with
me i heard all the music i possibl could hear i wa taught harmoni
and music form in direct connect with my practic work so that
theori wa a live thing to me and no abstract in my home town i
plai in an orchestra of twenti piecesoh no not a ladi
orchestrath other member were men grown i plai chamber music as
well as solo whenev the opportun offer at home and in public
in fact music wa part of my life
illustr maud powel with handwritten note
no student who look on music primarili as a thing apart in hi
exist as a breadwin tool as a craft rather than an art
can ever mount to the high place so often girl who sometim lack
the practic vision of boi although have studi but a few year
come to me and sai my on ambit is to becom a great virtuoso on
the violin i want to begin to studi the great concerto and i have to
tell them that their first ambit should be to becom musiciansto
studi to know to understand music befor thei ventur on it
interpret virtuos without musicianship will not carri on far
these dai in mani case these student come from small inland town
far from ani music center and have a wrong attitud of mind thei crave
the glamor of footlight flower and applaus not realiz that music
is a speech an idiom which thei must master in order to interpret the
work of the great compos
the influenc of the teacher
of cours all artist plai repres essenti the mental
control of technic mean but to acquir the latter in the right wai
while at the same time develop the former call for the best of
teacher the problem of the teacher is to prevent hi pupil from be
too imitativeal student ar natur imitatorsand further the
qualiti of music imagin in them pupil gener have someth
of the teacher toneauer pupil have the auer tone joachim pupil
have a joachim tone an excel thing but as each pupil ha an
individu of hi own he should never sink it altogeth in that of
hi teacher it is thi imit trend which often make it hard to
judg a young player work i wa veri fortun in my teacher
william lewi of chicago gave me a splendid start then i studi in
turn with schradieck in leipsicschradieck himself wa a pupil of
ferdinand david and of lonardjoachim in berlin and charl dancla in
pari i might sai that i ow most in a wai to william lewi a born
fiddler of my three european master dancla wa unquestion the
greatest as a teacherof cours i am speak for myself it wa no
doubt an advantag a decid advantag for me in my artist
develop which wa slowa famili traitto enjoi the broaden
experi of three entir differ style of teach and to be
abl to assimil the best of each yet joachim wa a far greater
violinist than teacher hi method wa a cramp on ow to hi
insist on pour all hi pupil into the same mold so to speak
of form them all on the joachim lath but dancla wa inspir he
taught me de briot wonder method of attack he show me how to
develop puriti of style dancla method of teach gave hi pupil a
technic equip which carri bow right along neck and neck
with the finger work of the left hand while the german ar apt to
stress finger develop at the expens of the bow and without ever
neglect technic mean dancla alwai put the pure music befor
the pure virtuoso side of plai and thi is alwai a sign of a good
teacher he wa unspar in take pain and veri fair
i rememb that i wa pass first in a class of eightyfour at an
examin after onli three privat lesson in which to prepar the
concerto movement to be plai i wa surpris and ask him why
mlle who it seem to me had plai better than i had not
pass ah he said mlle studi that movement for six month
and in comparison you with onli three lesson plai it better dancla
switch me right over in hi teach from german to french method
and taught me how to becom an artist just as i had learn in germani
to becom a musician the french school ha tast eleg
imagin the german is more conserv seriou and ha perhap
more depth
technic difficulti
perhap it is becaus i belong to an older school or it mai be becaus
i laid stress on technic becaus of it necess as a mean of
expressionat ani rate i work hard at it natur on should never
practic ani technic difficulti too long at a stretch young player
sometim forget thi i know that staccato plai wa not easi for
me at on time i believ a real staccato is inborn a knack i us
to grumbl about it to joachim and he told me onc that music
staccato did not have much valu hi own by the wai wa veri
labor and heavi he admit that he had none wieniawski had such a
wonder staccato that on find much of it in hi music when i
first began to plai hi d minor concerto i simpli made up my mind to get
a staccato it came in time by sheer forc of will after that i had
no troubl an artist staccato should like the trill be plastic
and under control for differ school of composit demand
differ style of treatment of such detail
octavesth unison not brokeni did not find difficult but though
thei ar suppos to add volum of tone thei sound hideou to me i have
us them in certain passag of my arrang of deep river but
when i heard them plai promis myself i would never repeat the
experi wilhelmj ha commit even a wors crime in tast by
put six long bar of schubert love av maria in octav of
cours thei repres skill but i think thei ar onli justifi in show
piec harmon i alwai found easi though whether thei ring out as
thei should alwai depend more or less on atmospher condit the
string and the amount of rosin on the bow on the concert stage if the
player stand in a draught the harmon ar sometim huski
the american woman violinist and
american music
the old dai of virtuoso trick have passedi should like to hope
forev not that some of the old type virtuoso were not fine player
remenyi plai beautifulli so did ol bull i rememb on favorit
trick of the latter for instanc which would hardli pass muster
todai i have seen him draw out a long pp the audienc listen
breathlessli while he drew hi bow wai beyond the string and then
look innoc at the point of the bow as though wonder where the
tone had vanish it invari brought down the hous
yet an artist must be a virtuoso in the modern sens to do hi full
duti and here in america that duti is to help those who ar grope for
someth higher and better music to help without rebuf them
when i first began my career as a concert violinist i did pioneer work
for the caus of the american woman violinist go on with the work
begun by mme camilla urso a strong prejudic then exist against
women fiddler which even yet ha not altogeth been overcom the
veri fact that a western manag recent told mr turner with surpris
that he had made a success of a woman artist prove it when i first
began to plai here in concert thi prejudic wa much stronger yet i
kept on and secur engag to plai with orchestra at a time when
thei were difficult to obtain theodor thoma like my plai he
said i had brain and it wa with hi orchestra that i introduc the
concerto of saintsan c min lalo f min and other to
american audienc
the fact that i realiz that my sex wa against me in a wai led me to
be startlingli authorit and convinc in the masculin manner when
i first plai thi is a mistak no woman violinist should make and
from the moment that jame hunek wrote that i wa not develop the
feminin side of my work i determin to be just myself and plai as
the spirit move me with no further thought of sex or sex distinct
which in art after all ar secondari i never realiz thi more
forcibl than onc when sit as a judg i listen to the
competit plai of a number of young profession violinist and
pianist the individu perform unseen by the judg plai in
turn behind a screen and in three case my fellow judg and myself
guess wrongli with regard to the sex of the player when we thought
we had heard a young man plai it happen to be a young woman and vice
versa
to return to the question of concertwork you must not think that i
have plai onli foreign music in public i have alwai believ in
american compos and in american composit and as an american have
tri to do justic as an interpret artist to the music of my nativ
land asid from the violin concerto by harri row shelli and henri
holden huss i have plai ani number of shorter origin composit
by such repres american compos as arthur foot mr hha
beach victor herbert john philip sousa arthur bird edwin grass
marion bauer cecil burleigh harri gilbert a walter kramer grace
white charl wakefield cadman and other then too i have present
transcript by arthur hartmann franci macmillan and sol marcosson
as well as some of my own transcript ar wrong theoret yet
some song like rimskykorsakov song of india and some piano
piec like the dvork humoresqu ar so obvious effect on the
violin that a transcript justifi itself my latest tempt in
that direct is my four american folk song a simpl set of
four wellknown air with connect cadenzasno variat no special
develop i us them first as encor but my audienc seem to
like them so well that i have plai them on all my recent program
some hint for the concert player
the veri first thing in plai in public is to free oneself of all
distrust in on own power to do thi noth must be left to
chanc on should not have to give a thought to string bow etc all
should be in proper condit abov all the violinist should plai with
an accompanist who is us to accompani him it seem superflu to
emphas that on program number must have been master in everi
detail onli then can on defi nervous turn excess of emot
into inspir
acoust plai a greater part in the success of a public concert than
most peopl realiz in some hall thei ar veri good as in the case of
the cleveland hippodrom an enorm place which hold fortythre
hundr peopl here the acoust ar perfect and the artist ha those
wonder silenc through which hi slightest tone carri clearli and
sweetli i have plai not onli solo but chamber music in thi hall
and wa alwai sorri to stop plai in most hall the acoust
condit ar best in the even
then there is the matter of the violin i first us a joseph
guarneriu a deeper tone instrument than the jean baptista guadagnini
i have now plai for a number of year the guarneriu ha a tone that
seem to come more from within the instrument but all in all i have
found my guadagnini with it glassi clear it brilliant and limpid
tonequ better adapt to american concert hall if i had a strad
in the same condit as my guadagnini the instrument would be
priceless i regret give up my guarneriu but i could not plai the
two violin interchang for thei were absolut differ in size
and toneproduct shape etc then my hand is so small that i ought
to us the instrument best adapt to it and to us the same instrument
alwai why do i us no chinrest i us no chinrest on my guadagnini
simpli becaus i cannot find on to fit my chin on should us a
chinrest to prevent perspir from mar the varnish my rocca
violin is an interest instanc of wood worn in ridg by the stubbl
on a man chin
string well i us a wire e string i began to us it twelv year
ago on humid foggi summer in connecticut i had had such troubl with
string snap that i cri give me anyth but a gut string the
climat practic make metal string a necess though some kind
person onc said that i bought wire string becaus thei were cheap if
wire string had been thought of when theodor thoma began hi career
he might never have been a conductor for he told me he gave up the
violin becaus of the e string and most peopl will admit that hear
a wire e you cannot tell it from a gut e of cours it is unpleas on
the open string but then the open string never do sound well and in
the highest regist the tone doe not spin out long enough becaus of
the tremend tension on ha to us more bow and it cut the hair
there is a littl surfac nap on the bowhair which a wire string wear
right out i had to have my four bow rehair three time last
seasonan averag of everi three month but all said and done it ha
been a godsend to the violinist who plai in public on the wire a on
cannot get the harmon and the aluminum d is objection in some
violin though in other not at all
the main thingno matter what string ar usedi for the artist to
get hi audienc into the concert hall and give it a program which is
properli balanc theodor thoma first advis me to includ in my
program short simpl thing that my listen could get hold
ofnoth inartist but someth select from their standpoint
not from mine and plai as artist as possibl yet there must
also be someth that is beyond them collect someth that thei
mai need to hear a number of time to appreci thi enabl the
artist to maintain hi digniti and ha a certain psycholog effect in
that hi audienc hold him in greater respect at big conservatori
where music studi is the most import thing and in larg citi
where the gener level of music cultur is high a big solid program
mai be given where it would be inappropri in other place
yet i rememb have mani recal at el paso texa onc after
plai the first movement of the sibeliu concerto it is on of those
composit which if plai too liter leav an audienc quit
cold it must be render temperament the big climax effect
built up it northern spirit brought out though i admit that even then
it is not altogeth easi to grasp
violin masteri
violin masteri or masteri of ani instrument for that matter is the
technic power to sai exactli what you want to sai in exactli the wai
you want to sai it it is technic equip that stand at the servic
of your music willa faith and compet servant that come at
your music bid if your spirit soar to part unknown your well
train servant technic is ever at your elbow to prevent irksom
detail from hamper your progress masteri of your instrument make
masteri of your art a joi instead of a burden technic should alwai be
the handmaid of the spirit
and i believ that on result of the war will be to bring us a greater
selfknowledg to the violinist as well as to everi other artist a
broader appreci of what he can do to increas and elev
appreci for music in gener and hi art in particular and with
these i am sure a new impetu will be given to the develop of a
music cultur truli american in thought and express

leon sametini at present director of the violin depart of the
chicago music colleg where sauret heermann and sebald preced him

unit state as often as in europ where hi extens tourn in
hollandleon sametini is a holland by birthbelgium england and
austria have establish hi reput as a virtuoso and the qualiti
of hi plai led ysay to includ him in a quartet of artist in

remain that thi erstwhil protg of queen wilhelminash gave him

weight to hi educ view
reminisc of sevcik
i began to studi violin at the ag of six with my uncl from him i
went to elder in amsterdam now willi hesss successor at the head of
the cologn conservatori and then spent a year with sevcik in pragu
yetwithout be hi pupili have learn more from ysay than from
ani of my teacher it is rather the custom to decri sevcik as a
teacher to dwell on hi absolut mechan charact of
instructionand not without justic first of all sevcik laid all the
stress on the left hand and not on the bowan absolut invers of a
fundament principl elder had taken great pain with my bow
technic for he himself wa a pupil of hubai who had studi with
vieuxtemp and had hi tradit but sevcik teach as regard the
us of the bow wa veri poor hi pupilstak kubelik with all hi
marvel finger facilitycould never develop a big bow technic their
plai lack strength rich of sound sevcik soon notic that my
bow did not conform to hi theori yet sinc he could not
legitim complain of the result i secur he did not attempt to
make me chang it music beauti interpret in sevcik case were
all subordin to mechan perfect with him the studi of some
inspir masterpiec wa pure a mathemat process a problem in
technic and mental arithmet without a bit of spontan ysay us
to roar with laughter when i would tell him how when a boi of fifteen
i plai the beethoven concerto for sevcika work which i myself felt
and knew it wa then out of the question for me to plai with artist
maturityth latter onli critic on my perform were that on
or two note were a littl too high and a certain passag not quit
clear
sevcik did not like the dvork concerto and never gave it to hi
pupil but i live next door to dvork at pragu and meet him in
the street on dai ask him some question anent it interpret
with the result that i went to hi home variou time and he gave me hi
own idea as to how it should be plai sevcik never point hi
teach by plai himself i never saw him take up the fiddl while i
studi with him while i wa hi pupil he paid me the compliment of
select me to plai sinigaglia engag violin concerto at short
notic for the first time in pragu sinigaglia had ask sevcik to
plai it who said i no longer plai violin but i have a pupil who can
plai it for you and introduc me to him sinigaglia becam a good
friend of mine and i wa the first to introduc hi rapsodia
piedmontes for violin and orchestra in london to return to
sevcikwith all the defici of hi teach method he had on
great gift he taught hi pupil how to practic andasid from
bowingh made all mechan problem especi finger problem
absolut clear and lucid
a quartet of great teacher with whom
all mai studi
still all said and done it wa after i had finish with all my
teacher that i realli began to learn to plai violin abov all from
ysay whom i went to hear plai wherev and whenev i could i think
that the most valuabl lesson i have ever had ar those unconsci
given me by four of the greatest violinist i know ysay kreisler
elman and thibaud each of these artist is so differ that no on
seem altogeth to replac the other ysay with hi uniqu
person the immens breadth and sweep of hi interpret hi
dramat strength stand alon kreisler ha a certain sparkl
scintil in hi plai that is hi onli elman might be call the
caruso among violinist with the perfect sensuou beauti of hi tone
while thibaud stand for suprem eleg and distinct i have
learn much from each member of thi great quartet and if the artist
can profit from hear and see them plai why not the student everi
recit given by such master offer the earnest violin student
priceless opportun for studi and comparison my special lean
toward ysay is due asid from hi wonder person to the fact
that i feel music in the same wai that he doe
teach principl
my teach principl ar the result of my own train period my
own experi as a concert artist and teacherbefor i came to america
i taught in london where isold meng among other studi with
meand what either directli or indirectli i have learn from my great
colleagu in the music colleg i give the advanc pupil their
individu lesson but onc a week the whole class assemblesa in
the european conservatoriesand those whose turn it is to plai do so
while the other listen thi is of valu to everi student sinc it
give him an opportun of hear himself as other hear him then
to stimul appreci and music develop there ar ensembl
and string quartet class i believ that everi violinist should be
abl to plai viola and in quartet work i make the player shift
constantli from on to the other instrument in order to hear what thei
plai from a differ angl
for left hand work i stick to the excel sevcik exercis and for
some pupil i us the carl flesch urstudien for studi of real
music valu rode of cours is unexcel hi studi ar the
masterpiec of their kind and i turn them into concert piec thibaud
and elman have suppli some of them with interest piano
accompani
for bow with the except of a few pure mechan exercis i
us kreutzer and rode and gavini ninetynin per cent of pupil
fault ar fault of bow it is an art in itself sevcik wa abl to
develop kubelik left hand work to the last degre of perfectionbut
not hi bow in the case of kocian anoth wellknown sevcik pupil
whom i have heard plai hi bow wa by no mean an outstand
featur i often have to start pupil on the open string in order to
correct fundament bow fault
when watch a great artist plai the student should not expect to
secur similar result by slavish imitationanoth pupil fault the
thing to do is to realiz the principl behind the artist plai and
appli it to on own physic possibl
everi on hold draw and us the bow in a differ wai if no two
thumbprint ar alik neither ar ani two set of finger and wrist
thi is why not slavish imit but intellig adapt should be
appli to the plai of the teacher in the classroom or the artist on
the concertstag for instanc the littl finger of ysay left hand
bend inward somewhata a result it is perfectli natur for him to
make less us of the littl finger while it might be veri difficult or
almost imposs for anoth to emploi the same finger and certain
composit and style of composit ar more adapt to on violinist
than to anoth i rememb when i wa a student that wieniawski
music seem to lie just right for my hand i could read difficult
thing of hi at sight
doubl harmon
would i care to discuss ani special featur of violin technic i might
sai someth anent doubl harmonicsa subject too often taught in a
mechan wai and on i have alwai taken special pain to make
absolut plain to my own pupilsfor everi violinist should be abl to
plai doubl harmon out of a clear understand of how to form them
there ar onli two kind of harmon natur and artifici natur
harmon mai be form on the major triad of each open string us
the open string as the tonic as for exampl on the g string and mr
sametini set down the follow illustr
illustr music notat
then there ar four kind of artifici harmon onli three of which
ar us harmon on the major third 1 harmon on the perfect
fourth 2 harmon on the perfect fifth 3 and harmonicsnev
usedon the octav
illustr music notat
where doe the harmon sound in each case two octav and a third
higher 1 two octav higher 2 on octav and a fifth higher 3
respect than the presseddown note if the harmon on the octav
4 were plai it would sound just an octav higher than the
presseddown note
now sai we wish to combin differ doubl harmon the whole
principl is made clear if we take let us sai the first doublestop in
the scale of c major in third as an exampl
illustr music notat
begin with the lower of these two note the c we find that it
cannot not be taken as a natur harmon
illustr music notat
becaus natur harmon on the open string run as follow g b d on
the g string d fmusic sharp sign a on the d string a cmusic sharp sign e on the a string and
e gmusic sharp sign b on the e string there ar three wai of take the c befor
mention as an artifici harmon the e mai be taken in the follow
manner
nat harmon artifici harmon
illustr music notat illustr music notat
now we have to combin the c and e as well as we ar abl reject
the follow combin as impossibleani violinist will see why
illustr music notat
we have a choic of the two possibl combin remain with the
finger indic
illustr music notat
with regard to the actual execut of these harmon i advis all
student to try and plai them with everi bit as much express feel
as ordinari note my experi ha been that pupil do not pai nearli
enough attent to the inton of harmon in other word thei
try to produc the harmon immedi instead of first make sure
that both finger ar on the right spot befor thei loosen on finger on
the string for instanc in the follow illustr music
notat first plai illustr music notat and then
illustr music notat then loosen the fourth finger and plai
illustr music notat
the same principl hold good when plai doubl harmon nine
tenth of the squeak heard when harmon ar plai is due to the
fact that the fingerplac is not properli prepar and that the
finger ar not on the right spot
never when plai a harmon with an upbow symbol upbow at the
point smash down the bow on the string but have it alreadi on the
string befor plai the harmon the process is revers when
plai a downbow symbol downbow harmon when begin a
harmon at the frog have the harmon readi then let the bow drop
gentli on the string
tripl and quadrupl harmon mai be combin in exactli the same wai
student should never get the idea that you press down the string as you
press a button andprestoth magic harmon appear thei ar a
simpl and natur result of the proper applic of scientif
principl and the sooner the student learn to form and combin
harmon himself instead of learn them by rote the better will he
plai them too often a student can give the finger of certain doubl
harmon and cannot us it of cours harmon ar onli a detail of
the complet masteri of the violin but masteri of all detail lead to
masteri of the whole
violin masteri
and what is masteri of the whole masteri of the whole real violin
masteri i think li in the control of the interpret problem the
power to awaken emot by the us of the instrument mani feel more
than thei can express have more left hand than bow technic and like
kubelik have not the perfect technic for which perfect plai
call the artist who feel beauti keenli and deepli and whose
mechan equip allow him to make other feel and share the beauti
he himself feel is in my opinion worthi of be call a master of the
violin

alexand saslavski
what the teacher can and cannot do
alexand saslavski is probabl best known as a solo artist as the
concertmast of a great symphon orchestra as the leader of the
admir quartet which bear hi name yet at the same time few
violinist can speak with more author anent the instruct phase of
their art not onli ha he been activ for year in the teach field
but as a pedagog he round out the tradit of ferdinand david
massard auer and grn vienna hochschul acquir dure hi
studi year with the result of hi own long and vari experi
begin at the begin i ask mr saslavski to tell me someth
about method hi own in particular method is a flexibl term he
answer what the word should mean is the cultiv of the pupil
individu along the line best suit to it not that a guid which
mai be emploi to develop commonsens principl is not valuabl but
even here the same guid violinmethod will not answer for everi
pupil person i find de briot violin school the most gener
us and for advanc student ferdinand david second book then
for scalesi insist on my pupil be abl to plai a perfect scale
through three octavesth hrimali book of scale mani advanc
violinist cannot plai a good scale simpli becaus of a lack of
fundament work
as soon as the pupil is abl he should take up kreutzer and stick to
him as the devote doe to hi bibl ani on who can plai the 42
exercis as thei should be plai mai be call a wellbalanc
violinist there ar too mani pure mechan exercisesand the
circumst that we have kreutzer rode fiorillo rovelli and dont
emphas the fact and there ar too mani elabor and complic
violin method sevcik for instanc ha devis a pure mechan
system of thi kind perfect from a pure mechan standpoint but
on whose consist us in my opinion kill initi and
individu i have had experi with sevcik pupil in quartet
plai and have found that thei have no express
what the teacher can and cannot do
after all the teacher can onli suppli the pupil with the violinist
equip the pupil must us it there is tone for instanc the
teacher cannot make tone for the pupilh can onli show him how tone
can be made sometim a pure physiolog reason make it almost
imposs for the pupil to produc a good natur tone if the
fingertip ar not adequ equip with cushion and a pupil
wish to us the vibrato there is noth with which he can vibrat
there is real mean speak of the violinist tone in the phrase
he ha it at hi finger tip then there is the matter of slow
practic it rest with the pupil to carri out the teacher injunct
in thi respect the averag pupil practic too fast is too eager to
develop hi art as a monei maker and too mani realli gift student
take up orchestra plai which no on can do continu and hope to
be a solo player four hour of studi work mai be nullifi by a singl
hour of orchestra plai music it is broaden of cours but i
am speak from the standpoint of the student who hope to becom a
solo artist an opera orchestra is especi bad in thi wai in the
symphon ensembl more care is us but in the opera orchestra thei
emploi the right arm for tremolo there is a good deal of camouflag
as regard string plai in an opera orchestra and much of the
musicnot wagnersi quit impractic
and lesson ar often made all too short a teacher in common honesti
cannot realli give a pupil much in halfanhourit is not a real
lesson there is a good deal to be said for class teach as it is
practic at the european conservatori especi as regard
interpret in my student dai i learn much from listen to
other plai the concerto thei had prepar and from note the
teacher correct and thi even in a pure technic wai i can
recal kubelik plai paganini as a wonder displai of the
technic point of violin plai
a great defect
most pupil seem to lack an absolut sens of rhythma great defect
yet where latent it mai be develop here kreutzer is invalu
sinc he present everi form of rhythmic problem scale in variou
rhythm and bow kreutzer exercis no 2 for exampl mai be
studi with ani number of bow to produc a broad tone the bow must
move slowli and in rapid passag should never seem to introduc
technic exercis in a concert number the student should memor
kreutzer and fiorillo flesch urstudien offer the artist or
profession musician who ha time for littl practic excel
materi but ar not meant for the pupil unless he be so far advanc
that he mai be trust to us them alon
tone practic time
broad plai give the sing toneth true violin tonea long bow
drawn it full length like everi gener rule though thi on must be
modifi by the judgment of the individu player violin plai is an
art of mani mysteri some pupil grasp a point at onc other have to
have it explain seven or eight differ wai befor grasp it the
seriou student should practic not less than four hour prefer in
twenti minut interv after some twenti minut the brain is apt to
tire and sinc the finger ar control by the brain it is best to
relax for a short time befor go on mental and physic control must
alwai go hand in hand four hour of intellig consist practic
work ar far better than eight or ten of fatigu effort
a nation conservatori
some five year ago too mani teacher gave their pupil the mendelssohn
and paganini concerto to plai befor thei knew their kreutzer but
there ha been a chang for the better dure recent year kneisel wa
on of the first to produc pupil here who plai legitim
accord to standard violinist ideal on reason why auer ha had
such brilliant pupil is that poor student were receiv at the
petrograd conservatori free of charg all thei had to suppli wa
talent and i look forward to the time when we will have a nation
conservatori in thi countri support by the govern then the
poor but music gift pupil will have the same opportun that
hi brother who is welltodo now ha
some person view and reflect
you ask me to tell you someth of my own music prefer well
take the concerto i have reach a point where the mendelssohn
mozart beethoven bach and brahm concerto seen to sum up what is
truli worth while the other begin to bore me even bruch paganini
wieniawski etc ar mainli medium of displai most of the great
violinist ysay thibaud etc dure recent year ar revert to
the violin sonata ysay for instanc ha recent been plai the
lazzari sonata a veri power and beauti work
my experi as a concertmast i have plai with weingartn
saintsan whose amiabl to me when he first visit thi countri
i recal with pleasur gustav mahler tschaikovski safonoff seidel
bauer and walter damrosch whose friend and associ i have been for
the last twentytwo year he is a wonder man manysid and
versatil a notabl fine pianist and plai chamber music with him
dure success summer is number among my pleasantest
recollect
in speak of concerto some time ago i forgot to mention on work
well worth studi thi is the russian mlynarski concerto in d
which i plai with the russian symphoni orchestra some eight year ago
for the first time in thi countri as well as a fine romanc and
capric by rubinstein
is the music a concertmast is call upon to plai alwai violinist
far from it symphon musicin as much as the concertmast is
concern is usual not idiomat violin music richard strausss
violin concerto can realli be plai by the violinist the obbligato
in hi symphoni ar a veri differ matter thei go beyond accept
technic boundari with stravinski it is the same the violin
obbligato in rimskykorsakov schhrazad though is real violin
music debussi and ravel ar most subtl thei call for a particularli
good ear sinc the harmon balanc of their music is veri delic
the concertmast ha to develop hi own interpret subject of
cours to the conductor idea
violin masteri
violin masteri it mean to me complet control of the fingerboard a
be at home in everi posit absolut sure of finger
absolut equal of tone under all circumst i rememb ysay
plai tschaikovski srnade mlancoliqu and us a finger
for certain passag which i like veri much i ask him to give it to
me in detail but he mere laugh and said id like to but i
cannot becaus i realli do not rememb which finger i us that is
masterya control so complet that finger wa unconsci and the
interpret of the thought wa all that wa in the artist mind
sevcik complet technic masteri is after all not perfect sinc it
repres mechan and not mental control

toscha seidel
how to studi
toscha seidel though on of the more recent of the young russian
violinist who repres the fruition of professor auer form
gift ha to quot hf peyser the transcendent technic observ
in the greatest pupil of hi master a command of mechan which make
the rough place so plain that the trace of their rough ar hidden
to the unpract ey he commenc to studi the violin serious at
the ag of seven in odessa hi natal town with max fiedemann an auer
pupil a year and a half later alexand fiedemann heard him plai a de
briot concerto in public and induc him to studi at the stern
conservatori in berlin with brodski a pupil of joachim with whom he
remain for two year
it wa in berlin that the young violinist reach the turn point of
hi career i wa a boi of twelv he said when i heard jascha
heifetz plai for the first time he plai the tschaikovski concerto
and he plai it wonderfulli hi bow hi finger hi whole style
and manner of plai so greatli impress me that i felt i must have
hi teacher that i would never be content unless i studi with
professor auer in 1912 i at length had an opportun to plai for the
professor in hi home at loschivitz in dresden and to my great joi he
at onc accept me as a pupil
studi with professor auer
studi with professor auer wa a revel i had privat lesson
from him and at the same time attend the class at the petrograd
conservatori i should sai that hi great specialti if on can us the
word specialti in the case of so univers a master of teach as the
professor wa bow in all violin plai the left hand the finger
hand might be compar to a perfectli adjust technic machin on
that need to be kept well oil to function properli the right hand
the bow hand is the direct oppositeit is the painter hand the artist
hand it phrase outlin the pictur of music it nuanc fill
them with beauti of color and while the professor insist as a matter
of cours on the absolut develop of finger mechan he wa an
inspir as regard the right manipul of the bow and it us as
a medium of interpret and he made hi pupil think often when i
plai a passag in a concerto or sonata and it lack clear he
would ask me why is thi passag not clear sometim i knew and
sometim i did not but not until he wa satisfi that i could not
myself answer the question would he show me how to answer it he could
make everi least detail clear illustr it on hi own violin but if
the pupil could work out hi own salvat he alwai encourag him to
do so
illustr toscha seidel with handwritten note
most teacher make bow a veri complic affair ad to it
difficulti but professor auer develop a natur bow with an
absolut free wrist in all hi pupil for he teach each student
along the line of hi individu aptitud henc the length of the
finger and the size of the hand make no differ becaus in the case
of each pupil thei ar treat as separ problem capabl of an
individu solut i have known of pupil who came to him with an
absolut stiff wrist and yet he taught them to overcom it
artist pupil and amateur student
as regard difficulti technic and other a distinct might be
made between the artist and the averag amateur the latter doe not
make the violin hi life work it is an incident while he mai
reason content himself with plai well the artistpupil must
achiev perfect it is the differ between an accomplish and
an art the amateur plai more or less for the sake of playingth
how is secondari but for the artist the how come first and for
him the shortest piec a singl scale ha difficulti of which the
amateur is quit ignor and everyth is difficult in it perfect
sens what i as a student found to be most difficult were doubl
harmonicsi still consid them to be the most difficult thing in the
whole rang of violin technic first of all thei call for a larg hand
becaus of the wide stretch but harmon were on of the thing i
had to master befor professor auer would allow me to appear in public
some find tenth and octav their stumbl block but i cannot sai
that thei ever gave me much troubl after all the main thing with ani
difficulti is to surmount it and just how is realli a secondari
matter i know professor auer us to sai plai with your feet if you
must but make the violin sound with tenth octav sixth with ani
technic frill the main thing is to bring them out clearli and
convincingli and rightli or wrongli on must rememb that when
someth doe not sound out convincingli on the violin it is not the
fault of the weather or the string or rosin or anyth elseit is
alwai the artist own fault
how to studi
scale studyal auer pupil had to practic scale everi dai scale
in all the intervalsi a most import thing and follow hi idea
of stimul the pupil selfdevelop the professor encourag us
to find what we need ourselv i rememb that oncew were stand
in a corridor of the conservatorywhen i ask him what should i
practic in the wai of studi he answer take the difficult
passag from the great concerto you cannot improv on them for thei
ar as good if not better as ani studi written as regard
technic work we were also encourag to think out our own exercis
and thi i still do when i feel that my third and sixth need
attent i practic scale and origin figur in these interv
but genuin result practic is someth that should never be
count by hour sometim i do not touch my violin all dai long and
on hour with head work is worth ani number of dai without it at the
most i never practic more than three hour a dai and when my thought
ar fix on other thing it would be time lost to try to practic
serious without technic control a violinist could not be a great
artist for he could not express himself yet a great artist can give
even a technic studi sai a rode tude a qualiti all it own in
plai it that technic howev is a mean not an end professor
auer never allow hi pupil to forget he is a wonder master of
interpret i studi the great concerto with himbeethoven
bruch mendelssohn tschaikovski dvork the brahm concerto which i
prefer to ani other the vieuxtemp fifth and lalo both of which i
have heard ysay that suprem artist who possess all that an artist
should have plai in berlin the elgar concerto a fine work which i
onc heard kreisler an artist as great as he is modest plai
wonderfulli in petrograd as well as other concerto of the standard
repertori and professor auer alwai sought to have us plai as
individu and while he never allow us to overstep the boundari of
the music esthet he gave our individu free plai within it
limit he never insist on a pupil accept hi own nuanc of
interpret becaus thei were hi i know that when plai for him
if i came to a passag which demand an especi beauti legato
render he would sai now show how you can sing the exquisit
legato he taught wa all a matter of perfect bow and as he often
said there must be no such thing as string or hair in the pupil
conscious on must not plai violin on must sing violin
transcrib note origin text read dvork
fiddl and string
i do not see how ani artist can us an instrument which is quit new to
him in concert i never plai ani but my own guadagnini which is a fine
fiddl with a big sonor tone as to wire string i hate them in
the first place a wire e sound distinctli differ to the artist
than doe a gut e and it is a differ which ani violinist will
notic then too the wire e is so thin that the finger have noth
to take hold of to touch firmli and to me the metal vibrat
especi on the open string ar most disagre of cours from a
pure practic standpoint there is much to be said for the wire e
violin masteri
what is violin masteri as i understand it first of all it mean
talent secondli technic and in the third place tone and then on
must be music in an allembrac sens to attain it on must have
music breadth and understand in gener and not onli in a narrowli
violinist sens and final the good god must give the artist who
aspir to be a master good hand and direct him to a good teacher

edmund severn
the joachim bow and other
the left hand
edmund severn activ in the field of violin music is a threefold
on he is a compos an interpret artist and a teacher and hi
fortuit control of the three vital phase of hi art make hi view
as regard it studi of veri real valu the lover of string music in
gener would natur attach more import to hi string quartet in
d major hi trio for violin cello and piano hi violin concerto in d
minor the sonata the orient italian new england suit for
violin and the fine suit in a major for two violin and piano than
to hi symphon poem for orchestra hi choral work and hi song
and those in search of hint to aid them to master the violin would be
most interest in have the benefit of hi opinion as a teacher
found on long experi and keen observ sinc mr severn is
on of those teacher who ar born not made and is interest heart
and soul in thi phase of hi music work it wa not difficult to draw
him out
the joachim bow
my first instructor in the violin wa my father the pioneer violin
teacher of hartford conn where my boyhood wa pass and then i
studi with franz milck and bernard listemann concertmast of the
boston symphoni orchestra but on dai i happen to read a few line
reprint in the metronom from some european sourc which quot
wilhelmj as sai that emanuel wirth joachim first assist at the
berlin hochschul wa the best teacher of hi gener thi wa
enough for me feel that the best could be none too good i made up
my mind to go to him and i did wirth wa the viola of the joachim
quartet and probabl a better teacher than wa joachim himself violin
teach wa a cult with him a religion and i think he believ god
had sent him to earth to teach fiddl like all the teacher at the
hochschul he taught the regular joachim bowingthei were oblig
to teach ita far as it could be taught for it could not be taught
everi on and that is the real troubl with the joachim bow it is
imposs to make a gener applic of it
joachim had a veri long arm and when he plai at the point of the bow
hi arm posit wa approxim the same as that of the averag
player at the middl of the bow willi hess wa a perfect expon of
the joachim method of bow why becaus he had a veri long arm but
at the hochschul the joachim bow wa compulsori thei taught or
tri to teach all who came there to us it without except boi or
girl whose arm chanc to be long enough could acquir it but big men
with short arm had no chanc whatev have a medium long arm by
dint of hard work i manag to get my bow to suit wirth yet i alwai
felt at a disadvantag at the point of the bow in spite of the fact
that after my return to the unit state i taught the joachim bow
for fulli eight year
then when he first came here i heard and saw ysay plai and i
notic how greatli hi bow differ from that of joachim the point
be that hi first finger wa alwai in a posit to press
natur without the least stiff thi led me to try to find a
less constrain bow for myself work along perfectli natur
line the joachim bow demand a high wrist but in the case of the
belgian school an easi posit at the point is assum natur and
it is not hard to understand that if the bow be drawn parallel with the
bridg allow for the least possibl movement of hand and wrist the
greatest economi of motion there is no contravent of the law of
natur and plai is natur and unconstrain
and thi appli to everi student of the instrument whether or no he
ha a long arm while i wa studi in berlin saras plai there in
public with the most natur and unhamp grace and freedom in the
us of hi bow yet the entir hochschul conting unanim
condemn hi bow as be stiffmer becaus it did not conform
to the joachim tradit of cours there is no question but that
joachim wa the greatest quartet player of hi time and with regard to
the interpret of the classic he wa not to be excel hi
concept of bach beethoven mozart brahm wa wonder the
insist at the hochschul on forc the bow which wa natur
to him on all other irrespect of physic adapt is a matter
of regret wirth wa somewhat defici in teach left hand technic
as compar with let us sai schradieck wirth real strength lai in
hi sincer and hi abil to make clear the music content of the
work of the great master in a beethoven or spohr concerto he made a
pupil give it due emphasi to everi singl note
a preteach requisit
befor the violin student can even begin to studi there ar certain
preteach requisit which ar necessari if the teacher is to be of
ani servic to him the violin is a sing instrument and therefor
the first thing call for is a good sing tone that bring up an
import pointth proper adjust of the instrument us by the
student if hi lesson ar to be of real benefit to him the compon
part of the instrument post bridg bassbar string etc must be
accur adjust in order that the sound valu ar what thei should
be
from the teach standpoint it is far more import that whatev
violin the student ha is on properli built and adjust than that it
be a fine instrument and the bow must have the right amount of spring
of elast in it stick a poor bow will work more harm than a poor
fiddl for if the bow is poor if it lack the right resili the
student cannot acquir the correct bow pressur he cannot plai
spiccato or ani of the bounc bow includ variou form of
arpeggio with a poor stick
draw a long bow
when i sai that the student should draw a long bow continu mr
severn with a smile i do not sai so at a ventur if hi instrument
and bow ar in proper shape thi is the next thing for the student to
do ever sinc tartini time it ha been acknowledg that noth can
take the place of the studi of the long bow plai in all shade of
dynam from pp to ff and with all the inflect of crescendo
and diminuendo part of thi studi should consist of mute
exercisesnot plai but draw the bow abov the string to it
full length rest at either end thi ensur bow control on great
difficulti is that as a rule the teacher cannot induc pupil to
practic these mute exercis in spite of their unquestion valu
all the great master of the violin have us them viotti thought so
highli of them that he taught them onli to hi favorit pupil and even
todai some distinguish violinist plai dumb exercis befor step
on the recit stage thei ar on of the best mean that we have for
control of the violinist nervou system
wristbow
wristbow is on of the bow in which the student should learn to
feel absolut and natur at home to my think the german wai of
teach wristbow is altogeth wrong their idea is to keep the
finger neutral and let the stick move the finger yet thi is
wrongfor the player hold hi bow at the fingertip that termin
point of the finger where the tactil nerv ar most highli develop
and where their direct contact with the bow make possibl the greatest
varieti of dynam effect and also allow the develop of far
greater speed in short bow
though the german sai think of the wrist i think with the belgian
put your mind where you touch and hold the bow concentr on your
finger in other word when you make your bow chang do not make it
accord to the joachim method with the wrist but in the natur wai
with the finger alwai in command in thi manner onli will you get the
true wrist motion
staccato and other bow
after all there ar onli two gener principl in violin plai the
long and short bow legato and staccato mani a teacher find it
veri difficult to teach staccato correctli which mai account for the
fact that mani pupil find it hard to learn the main reason is that in
a sens staccato is oppos to the natur of the violin as a sing
instrument to produc a true staccato and not a scratchato it is
absolut necessari while exert the proper pressur and movement
to keep the muscl loos i have evolv a simpl method for quickli
achiev the desir result in staccato first i teach the attack in
the middl of the bow without draw the bow and as though press a
button i have pupil press up with the thumb and down with the first
finger with all muscl relax thi when done correctli produc a
sudden sharp attack
then i have the pupil place hi bow in the middl in posit to draw
a downstrok from the wrist the bowhair be press and held
against the string a quick downbow follow with an immedi releas
of the string repeat the process us the upstrok the finish
product is mere the combin of these two exercisesdraw and
attack simultan i have never fail to give a pupil a good
staccato by thi exercis which compris the principl of all
genuin staccato plai
on of the most difficult of all bow is the simpl upanddown
stroke us in the second kreutzer tude that is to sai the bow
between the middl and point of the bow tte darchet as the french
call it thi bow is plai badli on the violin more often than ani
other it demand constant rapid chang and as most pupil plai it
the legato qualiti is notic absent too much emphasi cannot be
laid on the truth that the sing stroke should be emploi for all
bow long or short often pupil who plai quit well show a want of
true legato qualiti in their tone becaus there is no connect
between their bow in rapid work
individu bow should alwai be practic separ i alwai
oblig my pupil to practic all bow on the open string and in all
combin of the open string becaus thi allow them to
concentr on the bow itself to the exclus of all els and thei
advanc far more quickli student should never be compel to learn
new bow while thei have to think of their finger at the same time
we cannot serv two master simultan all in all bow is most
import in violin technic for control of the bow mean much toward
masteri of the violin
the left hand
it is evid howev that the correct us of the left hand is of
equal import it seem not to be gener known that
fingerpressur ha much to do with tonequ the correct pois of
the left hand as conspicu shown by heifetz for instanc throw
the extrem tip of the finger hammerlik on the string and render
full pressur of the string easi correctli done a brillianc result
especi in scale and passag work which can be acquir in no other
manner each note partak somewhat of the qualiti of the open string
as for intonationthat is larg a question of listen to realli
listen to oneself is as necessari as it is rare it would take a volum
to cover that subject alon we hear much about the us of the vibrato
these dai it wa not so when i wa a student i can rememb when it
wa laugh at by the purist as an italian evid of bad tast my
teacher decri it yet if we could hear the great player of the past
we would be astonish at their frugal us of it
on should rememb in thi connect that there wa a conflict among
singer for mani year as to whether the straight tone as cultiv by
the english oratorio singer or the vibrat tone of the italian were
correct as usual natur won out the correctli vibrat voic
outlast the other form of product thu prove it law basi
but todai the vibrato is frequent made to cover a multitud of
violin sin
it is accept by mani as a substitut for genuin warmth and it is
us as a camouflag to put over some veri bad art in the shape of
poor tonequ inton and gener sloppi of technic why
then ha it come into gener us dure the last twentyf year
simpli becaus it is base on the correctli produc human voic the
old player especi those of the german school said and some still
sai the vibrato should onli be us at the climax of a melodi if we
listen to a sembrich or a bonci howev we hear a vibrat on everi
tone let us not forget that the violin is a sing instrument and that
even joachim said we must imit the human voic thi i think
dispos of the case final and we must admit that everi littl boi or
girl with a natur vibrato is more correct in that part of hi
toneproduct than mani of the great master of the past as the negro
pastor said the world do move
violin masteri
ar masteri of the violin and violin masteri synonym in my mind
ye and no violin masteri mai be taken to mean that technic masteri
wherewith on is enabl to perform ani work in the entir literatur of
the instrument with precis but not necessarili with feel for it
beauti or it emot content in thi sens in these dai of
improv violin pedagogi such masteri is not uncommon but violin
masteri mai also be understood to mean not mere a cold though
flawless technic but it live glow product when us to express
the emot suggest by the music of the master thi latter kind of
violin masteri is rare inde
on who make technic an end travel light and should reach hi
destin more quickli but he whose goal is music with it
thousandhu beauti with it call for the exert of human and
spiritu emot set forth on a journei without end it is plain
howev that thi is the onli journei worth take with the violin as a
travel companion violin masteri then mean to me technic
profici us to the highest extent possibl for artist end

there is more music for me in the factori glorious grind out

illustr copyright by matzen chicago albert spald
yet lieuten spald despit the arduou demand of hi patriot
duti found time to answer some question of the writer in the
interest of violin masteri which repres the view and opinion
of so emin and distinct american a violinist cannot fail to
interest everi lover of the art write from rome sept 9 1918
lieuten spald modestli said that hi answer to the question
ask will have to be simpl and short becaus my time is veri
limit and then too have been out of music for more than a year i
feel it difficult to deal in more than a gener wai with some of the
question ask
violin masteri
as to violin masteri to me it mean effortless masteri of detail
the correl of them into a perfect whole the subject of them to
the express of an architectur which is music violin masteri mean
technic masteri in everi sens of the word it mean a facil which
will enabl the interpret to forget difficulti and to express at
onc in a languag that will seem clear simpl and eloqu that which
in the hand of other appear difficult obtus and dull
the most import factor in the
develop of an artist
as to the process mental and technic which make an artist these
differ process mental and technic ar too mani too vari and
involv to invit an answer in a short space of time suffic it to sai
that the most import mental process to my mind is the develop
of a percept of beauti all the persever in the studi of music
all the applic devot to it is not worth a tinker dam unless
accompani by thi awaken to the percept of beauti and with
regard to the influenc of teacher sinc all teacher vari greatli
the student should not limit himself to hi own person master the
true student of art should be abl to deriv benefit and instruct
from everi beauti work of art that he hear or see otherwis he
will be limit by the technic and mental limit of hi own
prejudic and jealousi on greatest difficulti mai turn out to
be on greatest aid in strive toward artist result by thi i
mean that noth is more fatal pernici for the true artist than
the precoci facil which invit cheap success therefor i make
the statement that on greatest difficulti ar on greatest
facil
a less develop phase of violin technic
in the technic field the phase of violin technic which is less
develop it seem to me is in most case bow on often note a
highli develop left hand technic coupl with a monoton and
oftentim faulti bow the color and varieti of a violinist art
must come larg from hi intim acquaint with all that can be
accomplish by the bow arm the break or chang from a downbow to an
upbow or vice versa should be under such control as to make it
percept onli when it mai be desir to us it for color or
accentu
good and bad hand mental studi
the influenc of the physic conform of bow hand and string hand
on actual plai there ar no good or bad bow hand or string
hand unless thei be deform there ar onli good and bad head
by thi i mean that the finest develop of technic come from the
head not from the hand quick of thought and action is what
distinguish the easi player from the clumsi player student should
develop mental studi even of technic detailsthi of cours in
addit to the physic practic for thi mental studi is of the
highest import in develop the student so that he can gain that
effortless masteri of detail of which i have alreadi spoken
advantag and disadvantag of concert
attend for the student
concert undoubtedli have great valu in develop the student
technic and mental but too often thei have a directli contrari
effect i think there is a veri doubt benefit to be deriv from the
present habit as illustr in new york london or other center of
the student attend concert sometim as mani as two or three a dai
thi habit dwarf the develop of real appreci as the student
under these condit can littl appreci true work of art when he
ha cram hi head so full of truck and worn out hi faculti of
concentr until listen to music becom a mechan mental
process the indiscrimin attend of concert to my mind ha an
absolut pernici effect on the student
nation as a form influenc
nation and nation feel have a veri real influenc in the
develop of an artist but thi influenc is felt subconsci more
than conscious and it react more on the creativ than on the
interpret artist by thi i mean that the interpret artist
while reserv the right to hi individu express should subject
himself to what he consid to have been the artist impuls the
artist intent of the compos as to type music to whose appeal i
as an american am suscept i confess to a veri sympathet reaction
to the syncop rhythm known as ragtim and which appear to be
especi american in charact for the benefit of those reader who
mai not chanc to know it lieuten spald alabama a southern
melodi and danc in plantat style for violin and piano repres
a veri delight creativ exploit of these rhythm the writer
make mention of the fact sinc with regard to thi and other of hi own
composit lieuten spald would onli state i felt that i had
someth to sai and therefor tri to sai it whether what i have to
sai is of ani interest to other is not for me to judg
plai while in servic
do i plai at all while in servic i gave up all plai in public when
enter the armi a year ago and to a great extent all privat plai

dure the past year onc in rome and onc in the littl town in itali
near the aviat camp at which i wa station at the time i have

theodor spier
the applic of bow exercis to
the studi of kreutzer
a walter kramer ha said mr spier know how seriou a studi can
be made of the violin becaus he ha made it he ha investig the
how and why of everi detail and what he ha to sai about the violin
is the utter of a big musician on who ha master the
instrument and theodor spier solo artist and conductor as a
teacher ha that wider horizon which ha justifi the statement made

the applic of new technic idea is easier when the music itself

the applic of bow exercis to the
studi of kreutzer
how do i us the kreutzer studi to develop style and technic by
make the student studi them in such wise that the follow principl
ar emphas in hi work control befor action mental direct at
all time relax and observ of string level for
unimped movement is more import than pressur as regard the
carri tone these principl ar among the most import pertain

the observ of string level is veri essenti while the stroke

four year with joachim in berlin it wa natur that i should first
commit myself to the pedagog method of the hochschul which to a
great extent howev i discard as my own view crystal i found
that too much emphasi allot the wrist stroke a misnom by the
wai wa bound to result in too academ a style by transfer
primari import to the control of the full armstrokewith the

better abl to reflect the larger interpret ideal which my year
of music develop were creat for me chamber musica youth
passionl me to interest myself in symphon work and conduct
these activ not onli react favor on my solo plai but

the grand manner in interpret it is thi realiz that place
me in a posit to earnestli advis the ambiti student not to
disregard the great artist benefit to be deriv from the cultiv

francobelgian and german school to the former i attribut my

control is such that the technic of the left hand and right arm ha

jacqu thibaud
the ideal program
jacqu thibaud whose gift as an interpret artist have brought him
so mani friend and admir in the unit state is the foremost
repres of the modern french school of violinplai and as
such he ha held hi own ever sinc at the ag of twenti he resign
hi rank as concertmast of the colonn orchestra to dedic hi
talent exclus to the concert stage so great an author as the
last edit of the riemann musiklexicon cannot forbear even in
1915 to emphas hi technic absolut develop in it everi
detail and hi fieri and poetic manner of interpret
but mr thibaud doe not see ani great differ between the ideal of
la grand cole belg that of vieuxtemp de briot lonard massart
and marsick whose greatest presentdai expon is eugn ysay and
the french himself a pupil of marsick he inherit the french
tradit of alard through hi father who wa alard pupil and hand
them on to hi son the two school have marri and ar as on
declar mr thibaud thei mai differ in the interpret of music
but to me thei seem to have merg so far as their system of finger
technic bow and tone product goe
the greatest difficulti to overcom
you ask me what is most difficult in plai the violin it is bow
bow make up approxim eighti per cent of the sum total of
violinist difficulti on reason for it is that mani teacher with
excel idea on the subject present it to their pupil in too
complic a manner the bow must be us in an absolut natur wai
and over elabor in explain what should be a simpl and natur
develop often prevent the student from secur a good bow the
end in view saras he wa an intim friend of mine alwai us
hi bow in the most natur wai hi control of it wa unsought and
unconsci were i a teacher i should not sai you must bow as i do
but rather find the wai of bow most conveni and natur to
you and us it bow is larg a physic and individu matter i
am slender but have long larg finger kreisler is a larger man than i
am but hi finger ar small it stand to reason that there must be a
differ in the wai in which we hold and us the bow the differ
between a great and a mediocr teacher li in the fact that the first
recogn that bow is an individu matter differ in the case of
each individu pupil and that the greatest perfect is attain by
the develop of the individu capabl within hi own norm

marsick as a teacher
marsick wa a teacher of thi type at each of the lesson i took from
him at the conservatoir we went to him three dai a week he would
give me a new tudegavini rode fiorillo dontto prepar for
the next lesson we also studi all of paganini and work by ernst and
spohr for our bow technic he emploi difficult passag made into
tude scalesth violinist daili breadw practic dai in dai
out marsick plai the piano well and could improvis marvel
accompani on hi violin when hi pupil plai i continu my
studi with marsick even after i left the conservatoir with him i
believ that three essentialsabsolut puriti of pitch equal of
tone and sonor of tone in connect with the bowar the base on
which everyth els rest
the mechan versu the natur in violin plai
sevcik pure soulless and mechan system ha undoubtedli produc
a number of excel mechanician of the violin but it ha just as
unquestion kill real talent kubelikther wa a genuin
talent violinist if he had had anoth teacher instead of sevcik he
would have been great for he had great gift even as it wa he plai
well but i consid him on of sevcik victim as an illustr of
how the technic point of view is thrust to the fore by thi system i
rememb some fifteen year ago kubelik and i were stai at the same
villa in montecarlo where we were to plai the beethoven concerto each
of us in concert two dai apart kubelik spent the livelong dai
befor the concert practic sevcik exercis i read and studi
beethoven score but did not touch my violin i went to hear kubelik
plai the concerto and he plai it well but then so did i when my
turn came and i feel sure i got more out of it music and
spiritu than i would have if instead of concentr on it
mean it music messag i had prepar the concerto as a problem
in violin mechan whose kei wa contain in a number of dry technic
exercis arbitrarili laid down
technic in the case of the more advanc violinist should not have a
place in the foreground of hi conscious i heard rubinstein plai
when a boywhat did hi fals note amount to compar with hi
wonder manner of disclos the spirit of the thing he plai
plant the parisian pianist a kind of keyboard cyclon onc express
the idea admir to an english societi ladi she had told him he wa a
greater pianist than rubinstein becaus the latter plai so mani wrong
note ah madam answer plant i would rather be abl to plai
rubinstein wrong note than all my own correct on a violinist
natur manner of plai is the on he should cultiv sinc it is
individu it realli repres him and a teacher or a colleagu of
greater fame doe him no kind if he encourag him to distrust hi
own power by too good naturedli show him how to do thi that or
the other i mean when the student can work out hi problem himself at
the expens of a littl initi
when i wa younger i onc had to plai bach g minor fugu at a concert
in brussel i wa live at ysay home and sinc i had never plai
the composit in public befor i began to worri about it
interpret so i ask ysay think he would simpli show me
how ought i to plai thi fugu the master reflect a moment and then
dash my hope by answer tu membt you bore me thi
fugu should be plai well that all at first i wa angri but
think it over i realiz that if he had shown me i would have
plai it just as he did while what he want me to do wa to work out
my own version and depend on my own initiativewhich i did for i had
no choic it is by mean of concentr on the higher the
interpret phase of on art that the technic side take it
proper secondari place technic doe not exist for me in the sens of a
certain quantiti of mechan work which i must do i find it out of
the question to do absolut mechan technic work of ani length of
time in realiz the three essenti of good violin plai which i
have alreadi mention ysay and saras ar my ideal
saras
all realli good violinist ar good artist saras whom i knew so
intim and rememb so well wa a pupil of alard my father
teacher he liter sang on the violin like a nightingal hi
puriti of inton wa remark and hi technic facil wa the
most extraordinari that i have ever seen he handl hi bow with
unbeliev skill and when he plai the unassum grace of hi
movement won the heart of hi audienc and increas the enthusiasm
awaken by hi tremend talent
we other violinist all of us occasion plai a fals note for we
ar not infal we mai flat a littl or sharp a littl but never
as often as i have heard saras plai did i ever hear him plai a wrong
note on not in perfect pitch hi spanish thing he plai like a god
and he had a wonder gift of phrase which gave a charm hard to
defin to whatev he plai and plai in quartetth greatest solo
violinist doe not alwai shine in thi genreh wa admir
though he plai all the standard repertori bach beethoven etc i
can never forget hi exquisit render of modern work especi of
a littl composit by raff call la fe damour he wa the first
to plai the violin concerto of saintsan lalo and max bruch thei
were all written for him and i doubt whether thei would have been
compos had not saras been there to plai them of cours in hi own
spanish music he wa unexcelleda whole school of violin plai wa
born and di with him he had a hobbi for collect cane he had
hundr of them of all kind and everi sovereign in europ had
contribut to hi collect i know queen christina of spain gave him
no less than twenti he onc gave me a coupl of hi cane a great sign
of favor with him i have often plai quartet with saras for he

stradivariu and guarneriu player
my violin it is a stradivariusth same which onc belong to the
celebr baillot i think it is good for a violin to rest so dure
the three month when i am not plai in concert i send my
stradivariu awai to the instrument maker and onli take it out about
a month befor i begin to plai again in public what do i us in the
meantim caressa the best violin maker in pari made me an exact copi
of my own strad exact in everi littl detail it is so good that
sometim when circumst compel me to i have us it in
concert though it lack the tonequ of the origin thi
understudi violin i can us for practic and when i go back to the
origin as far as the handl of the instrument is concern i never
know the differ
but i do not think that everi on plai to the best advantag on a
strad im a believ in the theori that there ar natur guarneriu
player and natur stradivariu player that certain artist do their
best with the on and certain other with the other and i also believ
that ani on who is equal good in both is great on neither the
reason i believ in guarneriu player and stradivariu player as
distinct is thi some year ago i had a sudden call to plai in ostend
it wa a concert engag which i had overlook and when it wa
recal to me i wa plai golf in brittani i at onc hurri to
pari to get my violin from caressa with whom i had left it buthi
safe in which it had been put and to which he onli had the
combin wa lock caressa himself wa in milan i telegraph him
but found that he could not get back in time befor the concert to
releas my violin so i telegraph ysay at namur to ask if he could
loan me a violin for the concert certainli he wire back so i
hurri to hi home and with hi usual generos he insist on my
take both hi treasur guarneriu and hi hercul strad
afterward stolen from him in russia in order that i might have my
choic hi brotherinlaw and some friend accompani me from namur to
ostendeno great distanceto hear the concert well i plai the
guarneriu at rehears and when it wa over everi on said to me
why what is the matter with your fiddl it wa the on ysay alwai
us it ha no tone at all at the concert i plai the strad and
secur a big tone that fill the hall as everi on assur me when
i brought back the violin to ysay i mention the circumst to him
and he wa so surpris and interest that he took them from the case
and plai a bit first on on then on the other a number of time
and invari when he plai the strad which by the wai he had not
us for year he ysayeimagin itcould develop onli a small tone
and when he plai the guarneriu he never fail to develop that
great sonor tone we all know and love so well take saras when
he live elman myselfw all have the habit of the stradivariu on
the other hand ysay and kreisler ar guarneriu player par
excel
ye i us a wire e string befor i found out about them i had no end
of troubl in new orlean i snap seven gut string at a singl
concert some sai that you can tell the differ when listen
between a gut and a wire e i cannot and i know a good mani other who
cannot after my last new york recit i had tea with ysay who had
done me the honor of attend it what string do you us he ask
me propo to noth in particular when i told him i us a wire e
he confess that he could not have told the differ and in fact
he ha adopt the wire e just like kreisler maud powel and other
and ha told me that he is charm with itfor ysay ha had a great
deal of troubl with hi string i shall continu to us them even
after the war when it will be possibl to obtain good gut string
again
the ideal program
the whole question of program and programmak is an intric on
in my opinion the usual recit program piano song or violin is too
long the public like the recit by a singl vocal or instrument
artist and financi and for other practic reason the artist too
is better satisfi with them but ar thei artist altogeth
satisfactori i should like to hear paderewski and ysay bauer and
casal kreisler and hofmann all plai at the same recit what a
varieti what a wealth of contrast artist enjoy such a concert
would afford there is noth that is so enjoy for the true artist
as ensembl plai with hi peer solo plai seem quit
unimport besid it
i recal as the most perfect and beauti of all my music memori
a string quartet and quintet with piano session in pari in my own
home where we plai four of the loveliest chamber music work ever
written in the follow combin beethoven 7th quartet ysay
vo i myself vo ii kreisler violah plai it remark welland
casal cello the schumann quartet kreisler vo i ysay vo ii
myself viola and casal cello and the mozart g major quartet
myself vo i kreisler vo ii ysay viola and casal cello then
we telephon to pugno who came over and join us and after an
excel dinner we plai the csar franck piano quintet it wa the
most enjoy music dai of my life a concert manag offer us a
fortun to plai in thi combinationjust two concert in everi capit
in europ
we have not enough varieti in our concert programsnot enough
collabor the truth is our form of concert which usual
introduc onli on instrument or on group of instrument such as the
string quartet is too uniform in color i can enjoi plai a recit
program of virtuos violin piec well enough but i cannot help fear
that mani find it too unicolor practic consider do not do
awai with the truth of an artist content though thei mai often
prevent it realiz what i enjoi most music is to plai
togeth with anoth good artist that is why i have had such great
artist pleasur in the joint recit i have given with harold bauer
we could plai thing that were realli worth while for each of usfor
the piano part of the modern sonata call for a virtuos technic and
music equip and i have had more satisfact from thi ensembl
work than i would have had in plai a long list of solo piec
the ideal violin program to plai in public as i conceiv it is on
that consist of absolut music or should it contain virtuos piec
then these should have some definit music qualiti of soul charact
eleg or charm to recommend them i think on of the best program i
have ever plai in america is that which i gave with harold bauer at
olian hall new york dure the season of 19171918
sonata in b flat mozart

either of these program is artist from the standpoint of the
composit repres and even these program ar not too
shortthei take almost two hour to plai while for my ideal program an
hourandahalf of beauti music would suffic you will notic that i
believ in plai the big fine thing in music in serv roast
rather than too mani hor doeuvr and pastri
on a solo program of cours on must make some concess when i
plai a violin concerto it seem fair enough to give the public three or
four nice littl thing butalwai piec which ar truli music not
such as ar onli eartickl kreislerh ha a great talent for
transcriptionha made charm arrang so ha tivadar nachz of
older thing and arthur hartmann these on can plai as well as shorter
number by vieuxtemp and wieniawski that ar delight such as the
former ballad et polonais though i know of music purist who
disapprov of it i consid thi polonais on a level with chopin
or take in the virtuoso field saras gypsi airsthei ar equal
to ani liszt rhapsodi i have onli recent discov that ysayemi
lifelong friendha written some wonder origin composit a
pome lgiaqu a chant dhiver an extas and a ms trio for two
violin and alto that is marvel these piec were an absolut find
for me with the except of the love chant dhiver which i have
alreadi plai in pari brussel amsterdam and berlin and expect to
make a featur of my program thi winter you see ysay is so modest
about hi own composit that he doe not attempt to push them even
with hi friend henc thei ar not nearli as well known as thei
should be
i never plai operat transcript and never will the music of the
opera no matter how fine appear to me to have it proper place on the
stageit seem out of place on the violin recit program the artist
cannot be too care in the choic of hi shorter program piec and
he can profit by the exampl set by some of the foremost violinist of
the dai ysay that great apostl of the truli music is a shine
exampl it is sad to see certain young artist of genuin talent
disregard the remark work of their great contemporari and secur
easili gain triumph with composit whose music valu is nil
sometim the wish to educ the public to give it a high standard of
appreci lead an artist astrai i heard a wellknown german
violinist plai in berlin five year ago and what do you suppos he
plai beethoven trio transcrib for violin and piano the last
thing in the world to plai and there wa to my astonish no
critic disapprov of what he did i regard it as littl less than a
crime
transcrib note origin text read standad
but thi whole question of program and repertori is on without end
which of the great concerto do i prefer that is a difficult question
to answer offhand but i can easili tell you which i like least it is
the tschaikovski violin concertoi would not exchang the first ten
measur of vieuxtempss fourth concerto for the whole of
tschaikovski that is from the music point of view i have heard the
tschaikovski plai magnific by auer and by elman but i consid
it the worst thing the compos ha written

the master violinist as an editor
that the editori revis of a number of our greatest live
violinist and teacher have pass through my editori room on their
wai to press is a fact of which i am decidedli proud leopold auer for
instanc is on of the most care exact and practic of editor
and the fact is worth dwell on sinc sometim the great artist or
teacher quit natur forget that those for whom he is edit a
composit have neither hi knowledg nor resourc auer never lose
sight of the compos own idea
and when i mention great violinist with whom i have been associ as
an editor mischa elman must not be forgotten i found it at first a
difficult matter to induc an artist like elman for whom no technic
difficulti exist to serious consid the limit of the averag
player in hi finger and interpret demand elman like everi
great virtuoso of hi calib is influenc in hi revis by the
manner in which he himself doe thing i rememb in on instanc i
could see no reason why he should mark the third finger for a
cantilena passag where a certain effect wa desir and question
it catch up hi violin he plai the note preced it with hi
second finger then instead of slip the second finger down the
string he took the next note with the third in such a wai that a most
exquisit legato effect like a breath the echo of a sigh wa
secur and the beauti of tone color in thi instanc not onli prove
hi point but ha led me invari to examin veri close a finger
on the part of a master violinist which repres a departur from the

fritz kreisler individu is also reflect in hi mark and
finger of cours those in hi educ edit ar strictli
meant for studi need but in gener thei ar difficult and base on
hi own manner and style of plai as he himself ha remark i
could plai the violin just as well with three as with four finger
kreisler is fond of finger octav and these becaus of hi
abnorm hand he plai with the first and third finger where virtuos
player as a rule ar onli too happi if thei can plai them with the
first and fourth to verifi thi individu charact of hi revis

the revision work of the master violinist is of veri great
import but often great artist and distinguish teacher hold
radic differ view with regard to practic everi detail of

final respons for their edit to harmon a hundr
conflict view and opinion the fiddler best qualifi to speak
with author will often disagre absolut regard the us of a
string posit upbow or downbow and besid meet the need of
student and teacher an editorinchief must bear in mind the artist
requir of the music itself in mani case the diverg in
teach standard reflect the person prefer for the edit
us less ambiti teacher choos method which make the studi of the
violin as easi as possibl for them rather than those whichin the
long runmai be most advantag for the pupil the best edit of
studi ar often cast asid for trivial reason such as ar embodi
in the poor excus that the fourth finger is too frequent indic
accord to the oldtim formula it wa gener accept that
ascend passag should be plai on the open string and descend
on us the fourth finger it stand to reason that the us of the
fourth finger involv more effort is a greater tax of strength and
that the open string is an easier plai proposit yet a realli
perfect technic demand that the fourth finger be everi bit as strong
and flexibl as ani of the other by natur it is shorter and weaker
and beginn usual have great troubl with itwhich make perfect
control of it all the more essenti and yet teacher contrari to all
sound principl and mere to save efforttemporarilyfor themselv
and their pupil will often reject an edit of a method or book of
studi mere becaus in it edit the fourth finger ha not been
depriv of it proper chanc of develop i know of case where
were it not for the guidanc suppli by editori revis the averag
teacher would have had no idea of the purpos of the studi he wa

a uniqu collect of violin studi
what special editori work of mine ha given me the greatest person
satisfact in the do that is a hard question to answer offhand
i might sai that perhap the collect of progress orchestr
studi for advanc violinist which i have compil and annot for
the benefit of the symphoni orchestra player is someth that ha meant
much to me person year ago when i plai professionallylong
befor the dai of miniatur orchestra scoresit wa almost
imposs for an ambiti young violinist to acquaint himself with the
first and second violin part of the great symphon work price of
score were prohibitiveand though in such work as the brahm
symphoni for instanc the concertmast part should be studi
from score in it relat to the rest of the partituraoften
mere to obtain a first violin part i had to acquir the entir set of
string so when i becam an editor i determin in view of my own
unhappi experi and that of mani other to give the aspir
fiddler who realli want to get at the violin part of the best
symphon music from bach to brahm and richard strauss a chanc to do
so and i believ i solv the problem in the five book of the modern
concertmast which includ all those realli difficult and import
passag in the great repertori work of the symphoni orchestra that
offer violinist problem my onli regret is that the grasp attitud
of european publish prevent the represent of certain import

a new classif of violin literatur
what i am inclin to consid howev as even more import in a
sens than my editori labor is a new educ classif of
violin literatur on which practic cover the entir field of
violin music and upon which i have been engag for sever year
insomuch as an editor work help in the acquisit of violin
masteri i am tempt to think thi catalogu will be a contribut of
real valu
as far as i know there doe not at present exist ani guid or handbook
of violin literatur in which the fundament question of grade ha
been present au fond thi is not strang sinc the task of
compil a realli valid and logic grade guidebook of violin
literatur is on that offer great difficulti from almost everi
point of view
yet i have found the work engross becaus the need of a book of the
kind which make it easi for the teacher to bring hi pupil ahead more
rapidli and intellig by give him an oversight of the entir
teachingmateri of the violin and under clear practic head in
detail order of progress is make itself more urgent felt everi
dai in classif there ar seven grade and a preparatori grade
i have not chosen an easier and convent plan of gener
consider of difficulti but have follow a more systemat
scheme on more close relat to the studi of the instrument itself
thu my preparatori grade contain onli materi which could be
advantag us with children and beginn those still struggl
with the simplest elementari problemscorrect draw of the bow across
the open string in a certain rhythmic order and the first us of the
finger and throughout the grade ar special subsect for special
difficulti special technic and other problem in short i cannot
help but feel that i have compil a real guid on with a definit
educ valu and not a catalogu masquerad as a violinist

violin edit made in america
on of the most signific featur of the violin guid i have
mention is perhap the fact that it content larg cover the
whole rang of violin literatur in american edit there wa a time
year ago when made in germani wa accept as a certif of
editori excel and mechan perfect those dai have long
sinc pass and the american edit ha come into it own it ha
reach a point of develop where it is of far more practic and
music stimul valu than ani european edit for american
edit of violin music do not take so much for grant thei reflect
in the highest degre the need of student and player in smaller
place throughout the countri and where teacher ar rare or
nonexist thei do much to suppli instruct by meticul regard for
all detail of finger bow phrase express by insist in
explanatori annot on the correct present of authorit
teach idea and principl in a broader sens violin masteri know
no nation but yet we associ the famou artist of the dai with
individu and distinct nation trend of develop and
school in thi connect i am convinc that on result of thi
great war of world liber we have wage on byproduct of the
triumph of the democrat truth will be a notabl american ideal of
violin masteri in the music as well as the technic sens and in
the develop of thi ideal i do not think it is too much to claim
that american edit of violin music and those who ar respons
for them will have done their part
