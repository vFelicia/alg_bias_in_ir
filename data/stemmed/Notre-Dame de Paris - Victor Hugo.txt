chapter i the grand hall
three hundr and fortyeight year six month and nineteen
dai ago todai the parisian awok to the sound of all the
bell in the tripl circuit of the citi the univers and the
town ring a full peal
the sixth of januari 1482 is not howev a dai of which
histori ha preserv the memori there wa noth notabl in
the event which thu set the bell and the bourgeoi of pari
in a ferment from earli morn it wa neither an assault by the
picard nor the burgundian nor a hunt led along in process
nor a revolt of scholar in the town of laa nor an entri of
our much dread lord monsieur the king nor even a pretti
hang of male and femal thiev by the court of pari
neither wa it the arriv so frequent in the fifteenth centuri
of some plume and bedizen embassi it wa bare two dai
sinc the last cavalcad of that natur that of the flemish
ambassador charg with conclud the marriag between the
dauphin and marguerit of flander had made it entri into
pari to the great annoy of m le cardin de bourbon who
for the sake of pleas the king had been oblig to assum an
amiabl mien toward thi whole rustic rabbl of flemish
burgomast and to regal them at hi htel de bourbon with a
veri pretti moral allegor satir and farc while a
drive rain drench the magnific tapestri at hi door
what put the whole popul of pari in commot as jehan
de troy express it on the sixth of januari wa the doubl
solemn unit from time immemori of the epiphani and the
feast of fool
on that dai there wa to be a bonfir on the place de grve a
maypol at the chapel de braqu and a mysteri at the palai de
justic it had been cri to the sound of the trumpet the
preced even at all the cross road by the provost men
clad in handsom short sleeveless coat of violet camelot with
larg white cross upon their breast
so the crowd of citizen male and femal have close their
hous and shop throng from everi direct at earli morn
toward some on of the three spot design
each had made hi choic on the bonfir anoth the maypol
anoth the mysteri plai it must be state in honor of the
good sens of the lounger of pari that the greater part of
thi crowd direct their step toward the bonfir which wa
quit in season or toward the mysteri plai which wa to be
present in the grand hall of the palai de justic the court
of law which wa well roof and wall and that the curiou
left the poor scantili flower maypol to shiver all alon
beneath the sky of januari in the cemeteri of the chapel of
braqu
the populac throng the avenu of the law court in
particular becaus thei knew that the flemish ambassador who
had arriv two dai previous intend to be present at the
represent of the mysteri and at the elect of the pope of
the fool which wa also to take place in the grand hall
it wa no easi matter on that dai to forc on wai into that
grand hall although it wa then reput to be the largest
cover enclosur in the world it is true that sauval had not
yet measur the grand hall of the chteau of montargi the
palac place encumb with peopl offer to the curiou
gazer at the window the aspect of a sea into which five or six
street like so mani mouth of river discharg everi moment
fresh flood of head the wave of thi crowd augment
incessantli dash against the angl of the hous which
project here and there like so mani promontori into the
irregular basin of the place in the centr of the lofti
gothic1 faad of the palac the grand staircas incessantli
ascend and descend by a doubl current which after part
on the intermedi landingplac flow in broad wave along
it later slopesth grand staircas i sai trickl
incessantli into the place like a cascad into a lake the
cri the laughter the trampl of those thousand of feet
produc a great nois and a great clamor from time to time
thi nois and clamor redoubl the current which drove the
crowd toward the grand staircas flow backward becam
troubl form whirlpool thi wa produc by the buffet of
an archer or the hors of on of the provost sergeant which
kick to restor order an admir tradit which the
provostship ha bequeath to the constableri the constableri to
the marchauss the marchauss to our gendarmeri of
pari
thousand of good calm bourgeoi face throng the window
the door the dormer window the roof gaze at the palac
gaze at the populac and ask noth more for mani
parisian content themselv with the spectacl of the
spectat and a wall behind which someth is go on becom
at onc for us a veri curiou thing inde
if it could be grant to us the men of 1830 to mingl in
thought with those parisian of the fifteenth centuri and to
enter with them jostl elbow pull about into that
immens hall of the palac which wa so cramp on that sixth of
januari 1482 the spectacl would not be devoid of either
interest or charm and we should have about us onli thing that
were so old that thei would seem new
with the reader consent we will endeavor to retrac in
thought the impress which he would have experienc in
compani with us on cross the threshold of that grand hall in
the midst of that tumultu crowd in surcoat short sleeveless
jacket and doublet
and first of all there is a buzz in the ear a dazzlement
in the ey abov our head is a doubl ogiv vault panel
with wood carv paint azur and sown with golden
fleursd beneath our feet a pavement of black and white
marbl altern a few pace distant an enorm pillar
then anoth then anoth seven pillar in all down the length
of the hall sustain the spring of the arch of the doubl
vault in the centr of it width around four of the pillar
stall of merchant all sparkl with glass and tinsel around
the last three bench of oak worn and polish by the trunk
hose of the litig and the robe of the attornei around the
hall along the lofti wall between the door between the
window between the pillar the intermin row of all the
king of franc from pharamond down the lazi king with
pendent arm and downcast ey the valiant and comb king
with head and arm rais boldli heavenward then in the long
point window glass of a thousand hue at the wide entranc
to the hall rich door fine sculptur and all the vault
pillar wall jamb panel door statu cover from
top to bottom with a splendid blue and gold illumin which
a trifl tarnish at the epoch when we behold it had almost
entir disappear beneath dust and spider in the year of
grace 1549 when du breul still admir it from tradit
let the reader pictur to himself now thi immens oblong hall
illumin by the pallid light of a januari dai invad by a
motlei and noisi throng which drift along the wall and eddi
round the seven pillar and he will have a confus idea of the
whole effect of the pictur whose curiou detail we shall make
an effort to indic with more precis
it is certain that if ravaillac had not assassin henri iv
there would have been no document in the trial of ravaillac
deposit in the clerk offic of the palai de justic no
accomplic interest in caus the said document to
disappear henc no incendiari oblig for lack of better
mean to burn the clerk offic in order to burn the document
and to burn the palai de justic in order to burn the clerk
offic consequ in short no conflagr in 1618 the old
palai would be stand still with it ancient grand hall i
should be abl to sai to the reader go and look at it and we
should thu both escap the necessityi of make and he of
read a descript of it such as it is which demonstr a
new truth that great event have incalcul result
it is true that it mai be quit possibl in the first place
that ravaillac had no accomplic and in the second that if he
had ani thei were in no wai connect with the fire of 1618 two
other veri plausibl explan exist first the great flame
star a foot broad and a cubit high which fell from heaven as
everi on know upon the law court after midnight on the
seventh of march second thophil quatrain

thi wa all that wa need
the music of high and low instrument immedi becam audibl
from the interior of the stage the tapestri wa rais four

climb the steep ladder of the theatr and arriv upon the
upper platform arrang themselv in a line befor the public
whom thei salut with profound rever then the symphoni

the mysteri wa about to begin
the four personag after have reap a rich reward of
applaus for their rever began in the midst of profound
silenc a prologu which we gladli spare the reader moreov
as happen in our own dai the public wa more occupi with the
costum that the actor wore than with the role that thei were
enact and in truth thei were right all four were dress
in particolor robe of yellow and white which were
distinguish from each other onli by the natur of the stuff
the first wa of gold and silver brocad the second of silk
the third of wool the fourth of linen the first of these
personag carri in hi right hand a sword the second two

sex of the two male charact wa briefli indic to everi
judici spectat by their shorter robe and by the cap which
thei wore on their head while the two femal charact less
briefli clad were cover with hood
much illwil would also have been requir not to comprehend
through the medium of the poetri of the prologu that labor wa
wed to merchandis and clergi to nobil and that the two

which thei desir to adjudg to the fairest onli so thei were

all thi wa in fact veri fine
nevertheless in that throng upon which the four allegori vi
with each other in pour out flood of metaphor there wa no
ear more attent no heart that palpit more not an ey wa
more haggard no neck more outstretch than the ey the ear
the neck and the heart of the author of the poet of that brave
pierr gringoir who had not been abl to resist a moment
befor the joi of tell hi name to two pretti girl he had
retreat a few pace from them behind hi pillar and there he
listen look enjoi the amiabl applaus which had greet
the begin of hi prologu wa still echo in hi bosom and
he wa complet absorb in that speci of ecstat

it pain us to sai it but thi first ecstasi wa speedili
disturb hardli had gringoir rais thi intox cup of

a tatter mendic who could not collect ani coin lost as he
wa in the midst of the crowd and who had not probabl found
suffici indemn in the pocket of hi neighbor had hit
upon the idea of perch himself upon some conspicu point in
order to attract look and alm he had accordingli hoist
himself dure the first vers of the prologu with the aid of
the pillar of the reserv galleri to the cornic which ran
round the balustrad at it lower edg and there he had seat
himself solicit the attent and the piti of the multitud
with hi rag and a hideou sore which cover hi right arm
howev he utter not a word
the silenc which he preserv allow the prologu to proce
without hindranc and no percept disord would have ensu
if illluck had not will that the scholar joann should catch
sight from the height of hi pillar of the mendic and hi
grimac a wild fit of laughter took possess of the young
scamp who without care that he wa interrupt the

boldli
look see that sickli creatur ask alm
ani on who ha thrown a stone into a frog pond or fire a shot
into a covei of bird can form an idea of the effect produc by
these incongru word in the midst of the gener attent
it made gringoir shudder as though it had been an electr
shock the prologu stop short and all head turn
tumultu toward the beggar who far from be disconcert
by thi saw in thi incid a good opportun for reap

chariti pleas
thi episod consider distract the attent of the
audienc and a goodli number of spectat among them robin
poussepain and all the clerk at their head gayli applaud
thi eccentr duet which the scholar with hi shrill voic
and the mendic had just improvis in the middl of the
prologu
gringoir wa highli displeas on recov from hi first
stupefact he bestir himself to shout to the four
personag on the stage go on what the devilgo onwithout
even deign to cast a glanc of disdain upon the two
interrupt
at that moment he felt some on pluck at the hem of hi surtout
he turn round and not without illhumor and found
consider difficulti in smile but he wa oblig to do so
nevertheless it wa the pretti arm of gisquett la gencienn
which pass through the rail wa solicit hi attent
in thi manner
monsieur said the young girl ar thei go to continu

in that case messir she resum would you have the

no said gisquett but what thei have said so far
gringoir start like a man whose wound ha been probe to the

from that moment forth gisquett wa noth to him

restor the scholar held hi peac the mendic count over
some coin in hi hat and the piec resum the upper hand
it wa in fact a veri fine work and on which as it seem to
us might be put to us todai by the aid of a littl
rearrang the exposit rather long and rather empti that
is to sai accord to the rule wa simpl and gringoir in
the candid sanctuari of hi own conscienc admir it
clear as the reader mai surmis the four allegor
personag were somewhat weari with have travers the three
section of the world without have found suitabl opportun
for get rid of their golden dolphin thereupon a eulogi of

young betroth of marguerit of flander then sadli cloister
in at ambois and without a suspicion that labor and clergi
nobil and merchandis had just made the circuit of the world
in hi behalf the said dauphin wa then young wa handsom wa
stout and abov all magnific origin of all royal virtu
he wa the son of the lion of franc i declar that thi bold
metaphor is admir and that the natur histori of the
theatr on a dai of allegori and royal marriag song is not in
the least startl by a dolphin who is the son of a lion it is
precis these rare and pindar mixtur which prove the poet
enthusiasm nevertheless in order to plai the part of critic
also the poet might have develop thi beauti idea in
someth less than two hundr line it is true that the
mysteri wa to last from noon until four oclock in accord
with the order of monsieur the provost and that it wa
necessari to sai someth besid the peopl listen
patient
all at onc in the veri middl of a quarrel between mademoisel
merchandis and madam nobil at the moment when monsieur
labor wa give utter to thi wonder line
in forest neer wa seen a more triumphant beast
the door of the reserv galleri which had hitherto remain so
inopportun close open still more inopportun and the
ring voic of the usher announc abruptli hi emin

would have rent hi ear less rude at that solemn and dramat
moment than these few word which fell from the lip of the
usher hi emin monseigneur the cardin de bourbon
it is not that pierr gringoir either fear or disdain
monsieur the cardin he had neither the weak nor the
audac for that a true eclect as it would be express
nowadai gringoir wa on of those firm and lofti moder and
calm spirit which alwai know how to bear themselv amid all
circumst stare in dimidio rerum and who ar full of
reason and of liber philosophi while still set store by
cardin a rare preciou and never interrupt race of
philosoph to whom wisdom like anoth ariadn seem to have
given a clew of thread which thei have been walk along
unwind sinc the begin of the world through the labyrinth
of human affair on find them in all ag ever the same that
is to sai alwai accord to all time and without reckon
our pierr gringoir who mai repres them in the fifteenth
centuri if we succe in bestow upon him the distinct which
he deserv it certainli wa their spirit which anim father
du breul when he wrote in the sixteenth these naiv sublim
word worthi of all centuri i am a parisian by nation and a

liberti of speech of which i have made us even toward
messeigneur the cardin uncl and brother to monsieur the
princ de conti alwai with respect to their great and
without offend ani on of their suit which is much to sai
there wa then neither hatr for the cardin nor disdain for
hi presenc in the disagre impress produc upon pierr
gringoir quit the contrari our poet had too much good sens
and too threadbar a coat not to attach particular import to
have the numer allus in hi prologu and in
particular the glorif of the dauphin son of the lion of
franc fall upon the most emin ear but it is not interest
which predomin in the nobl natur of poet i suppos that
the entiti of the poet mai be repres by the number ten it
is certain that a chemist on analyz and pharmacopol it
as rabelai sai would find it compos of on part interest to
nine part of selfesteem
now at the moment when the door had open to admit the
cardin the nine part of selfesteem in gringoir swollen and
expand by the breath of popular admir were in a state of
prodigi augment beneath which disappear as though
stifl that impercept molecul of which we have just
remark upon in the constitut of poet a preciou

tirad which well up everi instant from all part of hi
bridal song i affirm that he share the gener beatitud and
that quit the revers of la fontain who at the present
of hi comedi of the florentin ask who is the illbr
lout who made that rhapsodi gringoir would gladli have
inquir of hi neighbor whose masterpiec is thi
the reader can now judg of the effect produc upon him by the
abrupt and unseason arriv of the cardin
that which he had to fear wa onli too fulli realiz the
entranc of hi emin upset the audienc all head turn
toward the galleri it wa no longer possibl to hear on
self the cardin the cardin repeat all mouth the
unhappi prologu stop short for the second time
the cardin halt for a moment on the threshold of the estrad
while he wa send a rather indiffer glanc around the
audienc the tumult redoubl each person wish to get a
better view of him each man vi with the other in thrust hi
head over hi neighbor shoulder
he wa in fact an exalt personag the sight of whom wa well
worth ani other comedi charl cardin de bourbon archbishop
and comt of lyon primat of the gaul wa alli both to loui
xi through hi brother pierr seigneur de beaujeu who had
marri the king eldest daughter and to charl the bold
through hi mother agn of burgundi now the domin trait
the peculiar and distinct trait of the charact of the
primat of the gaul wa the spirit of the courtier and
devot to the power that be the reader can form an idea of
the numberless embarrass which thi doubl relationship had
caus him and of all the tempor reef among which hi
spiritu bark had been forc to tack in order not to suffer
shipwreck on either loui or charl that scylla and that
charybdi which had devour the duc de nemour and the constabl
de saintpol thank to heaven merci he had made the voyag
successfulli and had reach home without hindranc but
although he wa in port and precis becaus he wa in port he
never recal without disquiet the vari hap of hi polit
career so long uneasi and labori thu he wa in the habit
of sai that the year 1476 had been white and black for
himmean therebi that in the cours of that year he had lost
hi mother the duchess de la bourbonnai and hi cousin the
duke of burgundi and that on grief had consol him for the
other
nevertheless he wa a fine man he led a joyou cardin life
like to enliven himself with the royal vintag of challuau did
not hate richard la garmois and thomass la saillard bestow
alm on pretti girl rather than on old womenand for all these
reason wa veri agreeabl to the populac of pari he never
went about otherwis than surround by a small court of bishop

carous on occas and more than onc the good and devout
women of saint germain d auxerr when pass at night beneath

to hear the same voic which had inton vesper for them dure
the dai carol to the clink of glass the bacchic
proverb of benedict xii that pope who had ad a third crown

it wa thi justli acquir popular no doubt which preserv
him on hi entranc from ani bad recept at the hand of the
mob which had been so displeas but a moment befor and veri
littl dispos to respect a cardin on the veri dai when it wa
to elect a pope but the parisian cherish littl rancor and
then have forc the begin of the plai by their author
the good bourgeoi had got the upper hand of the cardin and
thi triumph wa suffici for them moreov the cardin de
bourbon wa a handsom manh wore a fine scarlet robe which he
carri off veri wellthat is to sai he had all the women on
hi side and consequ the best half of the audienc
assuredli it would be injustic and bad tast to hoot a cardin
for have come late to the spectacl when he is a handsom man
and when he wear hi scarlet robe well
he enter then bow to those present with the hereditari
smile of the great for the peopl and direct hi cours slowli
toward hi scarlet velvet armchair with the air of think of

revil the name of god a littl on so fine a dai in such good

all these detail which we here lai bare for the edif of
the reader were so cover by the gener uproar that thei were
lost in it befor reach the reserv platform moreov thei
would have move the cardin but littl so much a part of the
custom were the liberti of that dai moreov he had anoth
caus for solicitud and hi mien as wholli preoccupi with it
which enter the estrad the same time as himself thi wa the
embassi from flander
not that he wa a profound politician nor wa he borrow
troubl about the possibl consequ of the marriag of hi

vienn nor as to how long the good understand which had been
patch up between the duke of austria and the king of franc
would last nor how the king of england would take thi disdain
of hi daughter all that troubl him but littl and he gave a
warm recept everi even to the wine of the royal vintag of
chaillot without a suspicion that sever flask of that same
wine somewhat revis and correct it is true by doctor
coictier cordial offer to edward iv by loui xi would
some fine morn rid loui xi of edward iv the much honor
embassi of monsieur the duke of austria brought the cardin
none of these care but it troubl him in anoth direct it
wa in fact somewhat hard and we have alreadi hint at it on
the second page of thi bookfor him charl de bourbon to be
oblig to feast and receiv cordial no on know what

frenchman and a jolli companion to receiv flemish
beerdrinkersand that in public thi wa certainli on of

pleasur of the king
so he turn toward the door and with the best grace in the
world so well had he train himself to it when the usher

tone which render the entir hall attent to thi strang
colloqui dont you see that i am on of them
your name demand the usher
jacqu coppenol
your titl
hosier at the sign of the three littl chain of ghent
the usher recoil on might bring on self to announc
aldermen and burgomast but a hosier wa too much the
cardin wa on thorn all the peopl were stare and
listen for two dai hi emin had been exert hi utmost
effort to lick these flemish bear into shape and to render
them a littl more present to the public and thi freak wa
startl but guillaum rym with hi polish smile approach
the usher
announc master jacqu coppenol clerk of the aldermen of the
citi of ghent he whisper veri low
usher interpos the cardin aloud announc master jacqu
coppenol clerk of the aldermen of the illustri citi of
ghent
thi wa a mistak guillaum rym alon might have conjur awai
the difficulti but coppenol had heard the cardin
no cross of god he exclaim in hi voic of thunder
jacqu coppenol hosier do you hear usher noth more
noth less cross of god hosier that fine enough monsieur
the archduk ha more than onc sought hi gant5 in my hose
laughter and applaus burst forth a jest is alwai understood in
pari and consequ alwai applaud
let us add that coppenol wa of the peopl and that the
auditor which surround him were also of the peopl thu the
commun between him and them had been prompt electr
and so to speak on a level the haughti air of the flemish
hosier by humili the courtier had touch in all these
plebeian soul that latent sentiment of digniti still vagu and
indistinct in the fifteenth centuri
thi hosier wa an equal who had just held hi own befor
monsieur the cardin a veri sweet reflect to poor fellow
habitu to respect and obedi toward the underl of the
sergeant of the bailiff of saintegenev the cardin
trainbear
coppenol proudli salut hi emin who return the salut
of the allpow bourgeoi fear by loui xi then while
guillaum rym a sage and malici man as philipp de comin
put it watch them both with a smile of railleri and
superior each sought hi place the cardin quit abash
and troubl coppenol tranquil and haughti and think no
doubt that hi titl of hosier wa as good as ani other after
all and that mari of burgundi mother to that marguerit whom
coppenol wa todai bestow in marriag would have been less
afraid of the cardin than of the hosier for it is not a
cardin who would have stir up a revolt among the men of
ghent against the favorit of the daughter of charl the bold
it is not a cardin who could have fortifi the populac with a
word against her tear and prayer when the maid of flander
came to supplic her peopl in their behalf even at the veri
foot of the scaffold while the hosier had onli to rais hi
leather elbow in order to caus to fall your two head most
illustri seigneur gui dhymbercourt and chancellor guillaum
hugonet
nevertheless all wa over for the poor cardin and he wa
oblig to quaff to the dreg the bitter cup of be in such bad
compani
the reader ha probabl not forgotten the impud beggar who
had been cling fast to the fring of the cardin galleri
ever sinc the begin of the prologu the arriv of the
illustri guest had by no mean caus him to relax hi hold
and while the prelat and ambassador were pack themselv
into the stallslik genuin flemish herringsh settl himself

insol of thi proceed wa extraordinari yet no on
notic it at first the attent of all be direct
elsewher he on hi side perceiv noth that wa go on
in the hall he wag hi head with the unconcern of a
neapolitan repeat from time to time amid the clamor as from
a mechan habit chariti pleas and assuredli he wa
out of all those present the onli on who had not deign to
turn hi head at the alterc between coppenol and the usher
now chanc ordain that the master hosier of ghent with whom
the peopl were alreadi in live sympathi and upon whom all
ey were rivetedshould come and seat himself in the front row
of the galleri directli abov the mendic and peopl were not
a littl amaz to see the flemish ambassador on conclud hi
inspect of the knave thu place beneath hi ey bestow a
friendli tap on that rag shoulder the beggar turn round
there wa surpris recognit a light up of the two
counten and so forth then without pai the slightest
heed in the world to the spectat the hosier and the wretch
be began to convers in a low tone hold each other
hand in the meantim while the rag of clopin trouillef
spread out upon the cloth of gold of the dai produc the
effect of a caterpillar on an orang
the novelti of thi singular scene excit such a murmur of mirth
and gayeti in the hall that the cardin wa not slow to
perceiv it he half bent forward and as from the point where
he wa place he could catch onli an imperfect view of
trouillerf ignomini doublet he veri natur imagin
that the mendic wa ask alm and disgust with hi
audac he exclaim bailiff of the court toss me that
knave into the river
cross of god monseigneur the cardin said coppenol without

good good shout the populac from that moment master
coppenol enjoi in pari as in ghent great favor with the
peopl for men of that sort do enjoi it sai philipp de

and said to him in a low tonefin ambassador monsieur the
archduk send here to announc to us madam marguerit

margaritam swine befor the pearl
the whole littl court in cassock went into ecstaci over thi
plai upon word the cardin felt a littl reliev he wa
quit with coppenol he also had had hi jest applaud
now will those of our reader who possess the power of
gener an imag or an idea as the express run in the
style of todai permit us to ask them if thei have form a veri
clear concept of the spectacl present at thi moment upon
which we have arrest their attent by the vast parallelogram
of the grand hall of the palac
in the middl of the hall back against the western wall a
larg and magnific galleri drape with cloth of gold into
which enter in process through a small arch door grave
personag announc success by the shrill voic of an
usher on the front bench were alreadi a number of vener
figur muffl in ermin velvet and scarlet around the
daiswhich remain silent and dignifiedbelow opposit
everywher a great crowd and a great murmur thousand of
glanc direct by the peopl on each face upon the dai a
thousand whisper over each name certainli the spectacl is
curiou and well deserv the attent of the spectat but
yonder quit at the end what is that sort of trestl work with
four motlei puppet upon it and more below who is that man
besid the trestl with a black doublet and a pale face ala
my dear reader it is pierr gringoir and hi prologu
we have all forgotten him complet
thi is precis what he fear
from the moment of the cardin entranc gringoir had never
ceas to trembl for the safeti of hi prologu at first he had
enjoin the actor who had stop in suspens to continu
and to rais their voic then perceiv that no on wa
listen he had stop them and dure the entir quarter of
an hour that the interrupt last he had not ceas to stamp
to flounc about to appeal to gisquett and linard and to
urg hi neighbor to the continu of the prologu all in
vain no on quit the cardin the embassi and the
gallerysol centr of thi vast circl of visual rai we must
also believ and we sai it with regret that the prologu had
begun slightli to weari the audienc at the moment when hi
emin had arriv and creat a divers in so terribl a
fashion after all on the galleri as well as on the marbl
tabl the spectacl wa the same the conflict of labor and
clergi of nobil and merchandis and mani peopl prefer to
see them aliv breath move elbow each other in flesh
and blood in thi flemish embassi in thi episcop court
under the cardin robe under coppenol jerkin than
paint deck out talk in vers and so to speak stuf
beneath the yellow amid white tunic in which gringoir had so
ridicul cloth them
nevertheless when our poet beheld quiet reestablish to some
extent he devis a stratagem which might have redeem all
monsieur he said turn toward on of hi neighbor a
fine big man with a patient face suppos we begin again
what said hi neighbor
h the mysteri said gringoir
as you like return hi neighbor
thi semiapprob suffic for gringoir and conduct hi
own affair he began to shout confound himself with the
crowd as much as possibl begin the mysteri again begin
again
the devil said joann de molendino what ar thei jabber
down yonder at the end of the hall for gringoir wa make
nois enough for four sai comrad isnt that mysteri
finish thei want to begin it all over again that not fair
no no shout all the scholar down with the mysteri down
with it
but gringoir had multipli himself and onli shout the more
vigor begin again begin again
these clamor attract the attent of the cardin
monsieur bailiff of the court said he to a tall black man
place a few pace from him ar those knave in a holywat
vessel that thei make such a hellish nois
the bailiff of the court wa a sort of amphibi magistr a
sort of bat of the judici order relat to both the rat and
the bird the judg and the soldier
he approach hi emin and not without a good deal of fear
of the latter displeasur he awkwardli explain to him the
seem disrespect of the audienc that noondai had arriv
befor hi emin and that the comedian had been forc to
begin without wait for hi emin
the cardin burst into a laugh
on my faith the rector of the univers ought to have done the
same what sai you master guillaum rym
monseigneur repli guillaum rym let us be content with
have escap half of the comedi there is at least that much
gain
can these rascal continu their farc ask the bailiff
continu continu said the cardin it all the same to
me ill read my breviari in the meantim
the bailiff advanc to the edg of the estrad and cri after
have invok silenc by a wave of the hand
bourgeoi rustic and citizen in order to satisfi those
who wish the plai to begin again and those who wish it to end
hi emin order that it be continu
both parti were forc to resign themselv but the public and
the author long cherish a grudg against the cardin
so the personag on the stage took up their part and gringoir
hope that the rest of hi work at least would be listen to
thi hope wa speedili dispel like hi other illus
silenc had inde been restor in the audienc after a
fashion but gringoir had not observ that at the moment when
the cardin gave the order to continu the galleri wa far from
full and that after the flemish envoi there had arriv new
personag form part of the cortg whose name and rank
shout out in the midst of hi dialogu by the intermitt cry
of the usher produc consider ravag in it let the reader
imagin the effect in the midst of a theatric piec of the
yelp of an usher fling in between two rhyme and often in
the middl of a line parenthes like the follow
master jacqu charmolu procur to the king in the
ecclesiast court
jehan de harlai equerri guardian of the offic of chevali of
the night watch of the citi of pari
messir galiot de genoilhac chevali seigneur de brussac

messir loui de gravil chevali councillor and
chamberlain of the king admir of franc keeper of the forest
of vincenn
master deni le mercier guardian of the hous of the blind at
pari etc etc etc
thi wa becom unbear
thi strang accompani which render it difficult to follow
the piec made gringoir all the more indign becaus he could
not conceal from himself the fact that the interest wa
continu increas and that all hi work requir wa a
chanc of be heard
it wa in fact difficult to imagin a more ingeni and more
dramat composit the four personag of the prologu were
bewail themselv in their mortal embarrass when venu in
person vera incessa patuit dea present herself to them
clad in a fine robe bear the herald devic of the ship of
the citi of pari she had come herself to claim the dolphin
promis to the most beauti jupit whose thunder could be
heard rumbl in the dressingroom support her claim and
venu wa on the point of carri it offthat is to sai
without allegori of marri monsieur the dauphin when a young
child clad in white damask and hold in her hand a daisi a

submit to the good judgment of time holi virgin there wa
anoth good part that of the king of mesopotamia but through
so mani interrupt it wa difficult to make out what end he
serv all these person had ascend by the ladder to the
stage
but all wa over none of these beauti had been felt nor
understood on the entranc of the cardin on would have said
that an invis magic thread had suddenli drawn all glanc
from the marbl tabl to the galleri from the southern to the
western extrem of the hall noth could disench the
audienc all ey remain fix there and the newcom and
their accurs name and their face and their costum
afford a continu divers thi wa veri distress with
the except of gisquett and linard who turn round from
time to time when gringoir pluck them by the sleev with the
except of the big patient neighbor no on listen no on
look at the poor desert moral full face gringoir saw
onli profil
with what bitter did he behold hi whole erect of glori
and of poetri crumbl awai bit by bit and to think that these
peopl had been upon the point of institut a revolt against
the bailiff through impati to hear hi work now that thei
had it thei did not care for it thi same represent which
had been begun amid so unanim an acclam etern flood
and ebb of popular favor to think that thei had been on the
point of hang the bailiff sergeant what would he not have
given to be still at that hour of honei
but the usher brutal monologu came to an end everi on had
arriv and gringoir breath freeli onc more the actor

rise of a sudden and gringoir wa forc to listen to him
deliv amid univers attent the follow abomin

our piti thei ought at least to give us a moorish danc or
some other mummer that is not what wa told me i wa promis a
feast of fool with the elect of a pope we have our pope of
fool at ghent also were not behindhand in that cross of god
but thi is the wai we manag it we collect a crowd like thi

hole and make a grimac at the rest time on who make the
ugliest is elect pope by gener acclam that the wai
it is it is veri divert would you like to make your pope
after the fashion of my countri at all event it will be less
wearisom than to listen to chatter if thei wish to come and
make their grimac through the hole thei can join the game
what sai you messieur le bourgeoi you have here enough
grotesqu specimen of both sex to allow of laugh in
flemish fashion and there ar enough of us ugli in counten
to hope for a fine grin match
gringoir would have like to retort stupefact rage
indign depriv him of word moreov the suggest of
the popular hosier wa receiv with such enthusiasm by these
bourgeoi who were flatter at be call squir that

the scene of the grin match a pane broken in the pretti rose
window abov the door left free a circl of stone through which
it wa agre that the competitor should thrust their head in
order to reach it it wa onli necessari to mount upon a coupl
of hogshead which had been produc from i know not where and
perch on upon the other after a fashion it wa settl that
each candid man or woman for it wa possibl to choos a
femal pope should for the sake of leav the impress of
hi grimac fresh and complet cover hi face and remain
conceal in the chapel until the moment of hi appear in

and it magic the bonfir illumin with a red flare light
which trembl all aliv over the circl of face in the crowd
on the brow of the young girl and at the background of the place
cast a pallid reflect on on side upon the ancient black

the old stone gibbet
among the thousand of visag which that light ting with
scarlet there wa on which seem even more than all the

all rush toward the pillar hous
in the meanwhil gringoir had taken advantag of the dancer
embarrass to disappear the children shout had remind
him that he also had not sup so he ran to the public
buffet but the littl rascal had better leg than he when he
arriv thei had strip the tabl there remain not so much

it is an unpleas thing to go to bed without supper it is a
still less pleasant thing not to sup and not to know where on is
to sleep that wa gringoir condit no supper no shelter
he saw himself press on all side by necess and he found
necess veri crab he had long ago discov the truth
that jupit creat men dure a fit of misanthropi and that
dure a wise man whole life hi destini hold hi philosophi
in a state of sieg as for himself he had never seen the
blockad so complet he heard hi stomach sound a parlei and
he consid it veri much out of place that evil destini should
captur hi philosophi by famin
thi melancholi reveri wa absorb him more and more when a
song quaint but full of sweet suddenli tore him from it it
wa the young gypsi who wa sing
her voic wa like her danc like her beauti it wa
indefin and charm someth pure and sonor aerial
wing so to speak there were continu outburst melodi
unexpect cadenc then simpl phrase strewn with aerial and
hiss note then flood of scale which would have put a
nightingal to rout but in which harmoni wa alwai present
then soft modul of octav which rose and fell like the
bosom of the young singer her beauti face follow with
singular mobil all the capric of her song from the wildest
inspir to the chastest digniti on would have pronounc
her now a mad creatur now a queen
the word which she sang were in a tongu unknown to gringoir
and which seem to him to be unknown to herself so littl
relat did the express which she impart to her song bear
to the sens of the word thu these four line in her mouth
were madli gai

hallaron dentro un pilar
dentro del nueva bandera
con figura de espantar9
and an instant afterward at the accent which she impart to
thi stanza
alarab de cavallo
sin poders menear
con espada y lo cuello
ballesta de buen echar
gringoir felt the tear start to hi ey nevertheless her
song breath joi most of all and she seem to sing like a
bird from seren and heedless
the gypsi song had disturb gringoir reveri as the swan
disturb the water he listen in a sort of raptur and
forget of everyth it wa the first moment in the
cours of mani hour when he did not feel that he suffer
the moment wa brief
the same woman voic which had interrupt the gypsi danc
interrupt her song

aggress against the gypsi had their attent not been
divert at thi moment by the process of the pope of the
fool which after have travers mani street and squar
debouch on the place de grve with all it torch and all it

fool bore on their shoulder a litter more load down with
candl than the reliquari of saintegenev in time of pest
and on thi litter shone resplend with crosier cope and
mitr the new pope of the fool the bellring of notredam
quasimodo the hunchback
each section of thi grotesqu process had it own music the
egyptian made their drum and african tambourin resound the
slang men not a veri music race still clung to the goat
horn trumpet and the gothic rubebb of the twelfth centuri the
empir of galile wa not much more advanc among it music on
could hardli distinguish some miser rebec from the infanc

the pope of the fool that all the music rich of the epoch
were displai in a magnific discord it wa noth but
soprano rebec countertenor rebec and tenor rebec not to
reckon the flute and brass instrument ala our reader will
rememb that thi wa gringoir orchestra
it is difficult to convei an idea of the degre of proud and
bliss expans to which the sad and hideou visag of
quasimodo had attain dure the transit from the palai de
justic to the place de grve it wa the first enjoy of
selflov that he had ever experienc down to that dai he had
known onli humili disdain for hi condit disgust for

verit pope the acclam of that throng which he hate
becaus he felt that he wa hate by it what matter it that
hi peopl consist of a pack of fool crippl thiev and
beggar it wa still a peopl and he wa it sovereign and he
accept serious all thi iron applaus all thi deris
respect with which the crowd mingl it must be admit a
good deal of veri real fear for the hunchback wa robust for
the bandyleg fellow wa agil for the deaf man wa
malici three qualiti which temper ridicul
we ar far from believ howev that the new pope of the
fool understood both the sentiment which he felt and the
sentiment which he inspir the spirit which wa lodg in thi
failur of a bodi had necessarili someth incomplet and deaf
about it thu what he felt at the moment wa to him absolut
vagu indistinct and confus onli joi made itself felt onli
pride domin around that sombr and unhappi face there hung
a radianc
it wa then not without surpris and alarm that at the veri
moment when quasimodo wa pass the pillar hous in that
semiintox state a man wa seen to dart from the crowd
and to tear from hi hand with a gestur of anger hi crosier
of gild wood the emblem of hi mock popeship
thi man thi rash individu wa the man with the bald brow
who a moment earlier stand with the gypsi group had
chill the poor girl with hi word of menac and of hatr he
wa dress in an ecclesiast costum at the moment when he
stood forth from the crowd gringoir who had not notic him up
to that time recogn him hold he said with an
exclam of astonish eh ti my master in herm dom
claud frollo the archdeacon what the devil doe he want of
that old oneei fellow hell get himself devour
a cry of terror aros in fact the formid quasimodo had
hurl himself from the litter and the women turn asid their
ey in order not to see him tear the archdeacon asund
he made on bound as far as the priest look at him and fell
upon hi knee
the priest tore off hi tiara broke hi crozier and rent hi
tinsel cope
quasimodo remain on hi knee with head bent and hand
clasp then there wa establish between them a strang
dialogu of sign and gestur for neither of them spoke the
priest erect on hi feet irrit threaten imperi
quasimodo prostrat humbl suppliant and nevertheless it is
certain that quasimodo could have crush the priest with hi
thumb
at length the archdeacon give quasimodo power shoulder a
rough shake made him a sign to rise and follow him
quasimodo rose
then the brotherhood of fool their first stupor have pass
off wish to defend their pope so abruptli dethron the
egyptian the men of slang and all the fratern of law
clerk gather howl round the priest
quasimodo place himself in front of the priest set in plai the
muscl of hi athlet fist and glare upon the assail
with the snarl of an angri tiger
the priest resum hi sombr graviti made a sign to quasimodo
and retir in silenc
quasimodo walk in front of him scatter the crowd as he
pass
when thei had travers the populac and the place the cloud of
curiou and idl were mind to follow them quasimodo then
constitut himself the rearguard and follow the archdeacon
walk backward squat surli monstrou bristl gather
up hi limb lick hi boar tusk growl like a wild
beast and impart to the crowd immens vibrat with a look
or a gestur
both were allow to plung into a dark and narrow street where
no on dare to ventur after them so thoroughli did the mere
chimera of quasimodo gnash hi teeth bar the entranc
here a marvel thing said gringoir but where the deuc
shall i find some supper
chapter iv the inconveni of follow a pretti woman
through the street in the even
gringoir set out to follow the gypsi at all hazard he had seen
her accompani by her goat take to the rue de la coutelleri
he took the rue de la coutelleri
why not he said to himself
gringoir a practic philosoph of the street of pari had
notic that noth is more propiti to reveri than follow
a pretti woman without know whither she is go there wa in
thi voluntari abdic of hi freewil in thi fanci
submit itself to anoth fanci which suspect it not a
mixtur of fantast independ and blind obedi someth
indescrib intermedi between slaveri and liberti which
pleas gringoirea spirit essenti compound undecid and
complex hold the extrem of all extrem incessantli
suspend between all human propens and neutral on by
the other he wa fond of compar himself to mahomet coffin
attract in two differ direct by two loadston and
hesit etern between the height and the depth between
the vault and the pavement between fall and ascent between
zenith and nadir
if gringoir had live in our dai what a fine middl cours he
would hold between classic and romantic
but he wa not suffici primit to live three hundr
year and ti a piti hi absenc is a void which is but too
sensibl felt todai
moreov for the purpos of thu follow passersbi and
especi femal passersbi in the street which gringoir wa
fond of do there is no better disposit than ignor of

so he walk along veri thoughtfulli behind the young girl who

came up on their side in great hast and with great clamor of
bowl and crutch upon the pavement then all three jostl
each other at poor gringoir heel began to sing their song to

at last he reach the end of the street it open upon an

book third
chapter i notredam
the church of notredam de pari is still no doubt a majest
and sublim edific but beauti as it ha been preserv in
grow old it is difficult not to sigh not to wax indign
befor the numberless degrad and mutil which time and
men have both caus the vener monument to suffer without
respect for charlemagn who laid it first stone or for philip
augustu who laid the last
on the face of thi ag queen of our cathedr by the side of
a wrinkl on alwai find a scar tempu edax homo
edacior18 which i should be glad to translat thu time is
blind man is stupid
if we had leisur to examin with the reader on by on the
divers trace of destruct imprint upon the old church
time share would be the least the share of men the most
especi the men of art sinc there have been individu
who assum the titl of architect dure the last two
centuri
and in the first place to cite onli a few lead exampl
there certainli ar few finer architectur page than thi
faad where success and at onc the three portal
hollow out in an arch the broider and dentat cordon of the
eight and twenti royal nich the immens central rose window
flank by it two later window like a priest by hi deacon
and subdeacon the frail and lofti galleri of trefoil arcad
which support a heavi platform abov it fine slender column
and lastli the two black and massiv tower with their slate
penthous harmoni part of a magnific whole superpos
in five gigant storiesdevelop themselv befor the ey in a
mass and without confus with their innumer detail of
statuari carv and sculptur join powerfulli to the
tranquil grandeur of the whole a vast symphoni in stone so to
speak the coloss work of on man and on peopl all togeth
on and complex like the iliad and the romancero whose sister
it is prodigi product of the group togeth of all the
forc of an epoch where upon each stone on see the fanci of
the workman disciplin by the geniu of the artist start forth
in a hundr fashion a sort of human creation in a word
power and fecund as the divin creation of which it seem to
have stolen the doubl charactervarieti etern
and what we here sai of the faad must be said of the entir
church and what we sai of the cathedr church of pari must be
said of all the church of christendom in the middl ag all
thing ar in place in that art selfcreat logic and well
proport to measur the great toe of the foot is to measur
the giant
let us return to the faad of notredam as it still appear to
us when we go piousli to admir the grave and puissant
cathedr which inspir terror so it chronicl assert qu

thu caus the eleven step which ad to the majest height

more than it ha taken awai for it is time which ha spread over
the faad that sombr hue of the centuri which make the old

portal that new and bastard arch who ha dare to frame therein
that commonplac and heavi door of carv wood la loui xv
besid the arabesqu of biscornett the men the architect

and if we enter the interior of the edific who ha overthrown
that colossu of saint christoph proverbi for magnitud

myriad of statu which peopl all the space between the

how far it is from the epoch when robert cenali compar
notredam de pari to the famou templ of diana at ephesu so

notredam is not moreov what can be call a complet

howev these edific of the transit from the romanesqu to

thei express a shade of the art which would be lost without them
it is the graft of the point upon the round arch
notredam de pari is in particular a curiou specimen of thi

pari had it birth as the reader know in that old island of

final leap the wall of philip augustu and scatter joyfulli

of the connoisseur easili distinguish and furnish with a

the pari of the present dai ha then no gener physiognomi it

our father had a pari of stone our son will have on of

so far as the modern monument of new pari ar concern we

that the architectur of a build should be adapt to it
purpos in such a manner that thi purpos shall be immedi
appar from the mere aspect of the build on cannot be too
much amaz at a structur which might be indifferentlyth

snow and of cours roof ar made to be swept as for it
purpos of which we just spoke it fulfil it to a marvel it is
a bours in franc as it would have been a templ in greec it
is true that the architect wa at a good deal of troubl to
conceal the clock face which would have destroi the puriti of
the fine line of the faad but on the other hand we have
that colonnad which circl round the edific and under which
on dai of high religi ceremoni the theori of the

at on hi knee sinc 1413 when thei took it into their head to
overthrow the saint and the faith follow upon thi bed of
wood it wa customari to expos foundl for public chariti
whoever care to take them did so in front of the wooden bed wa
a copper basin for alm
the sort of live be which lai upon that plank on the morn
of quasimodo in the year of the lord 1467 appear to excit
to a high degre the curios of the numer group which had

how innoc that poor la herm is resum jehann dont you
see sister that thi littl monster is at least four year old
and that he would have less appetit for your breast than for a
turnspit
the littl monster we should find it difficult ourselv to
describ him otherwis wa in fact not a newborn child it
wa a veri angular and veri live littl mass imprison in it
linen sack stamp with the cipher of messir guillaum
chartier then bishop of pari with a head project that head

my opinion is exclaim jehann de la tarm that it would be
better for the lout of pari if thi littl magician were put
to bed on a fagot than on a plank
a fine flame fagot ad the old woman
it would be more prudent said mistricol
for sever minut a young priest had been listen to the

for acquir and hoard in the matter of scienc at the ag
of eighteen he had made hi wai through the four faculti it
seem to the young man that life had but on sole object

it wa toward thi epoch that the excess heat of the summer
of 1466 caus that grand outburst of the plagu which carri
off more than forti thousand soul in the vicomti of pari and
among other as jean de troy state master arnoul
astrolog to the king who wa a veri fine man both wise and
pleasant the rumor spread in the univers that the rue

with passion and devot toward that child hi brother a
sweet and strang thing wa a human affect to him who had
hitherto love hi book alon
thi affect develop to a singular point in a soul so new
it wa like a first love separ sinc infanc from hi
parent whom he had hardli known cloister and immur as it
were in hi book eager abov all thing to studi and to learn
exclus attent up to that time to hi intellig which
broaden in scienc to hi imagin which expand in
lettersth poor scholar had not yet had time to feel the place
of hi heart
thi young brother without mother or father thi littl child
which had fallen abruptli from heaven into hi arm made a new
man of him he perceiv that there wa someth els in the
world besid the specul of the sorbonn and the vers of
homer that man need affect that life without tender
and without love wa onli a set of dry shriek and rend
wheel onli he imagin for he wa at the ag when illus
ar as yet replac onli by illus that the affect of
blood and famili were the sole on necessari and that a littl
brother to love suffic to fill an entir exist
he threw himself therefor into the love for hi littl jehan
with the passion of a charact alreadi profound ardent
concentr that poor frail creatur pretti fairhair
rosi and curlythat orphan with anoth orphan for hi onli
support touch him to the bottom of hi heart and grave
thinker as he wa he set to medit upon jehan with an
infinit compass he kept watch and ward over him as over
someth veri fragil and veri worthi of care he wa more than
a brother to the child he becam a mother to him
littl jehan had lost hi mother while he wa still at the

from that time forth feel that he had a burden to bear he
took life veri serious the thought of hi littl brother
becam not onli hi recreat but the object of hi studi he
resolv to consecr himself entir to a futur for which he
wa respons in the sight of god and never to have ani other
wife ani other child than the happi and fortun of hi

the cleric profess hi merit hi learn hi qualiti of

there plung more deepli than ever in hi dear book which he
quit onli to run for an hour to the fief of moulin thi
mixtur of learn and auster so rare at hi ag had
promptli acquir for him the respect and admir of the
monasteri from the cloister hi reput as a learn man had
pass to the peopl among whom it had chang a littl a
frequent occurr at that time into reput as a sorcer
it wa at the moment when he wa return on quasimodo dai
from sai hi mass at the altar of the lazi which wa by the
side of the door lead to the nave on the right near the imag
of the virgin that hi attent had been attract by the group
of old women chatter around the bed for foundl
then it wa that he approach the unhappi littl creatur which
wa so hate and so menac that distress that deform that
abandon the thought of hi young brother the idea which
suddenli occur to him that if he were to die hi dear littl
jehan might also be flung miser on the plank for
foundlingsal thi had gone to hi heart simultan a
great piti had move in him and he had carri off the child
when he remov the child from the sack he found it greatli
deform in veri sooth the poor littl wretch had a wart on hi
left ey hi head place directli on hi shoulder hi spinal
column wa crook hi breast bone promin and hi leg
bow but he appear to be live and although it wa
imposs to sai in what languag he lisp hi cry indic
consider forc and health claud compass increas at
the sight of thi ugli and he made a vow in hi heart to
rear the child for the love of hi brother in order that
whatev might be the futur fault of the littl jehan he
should have besid him that chariti done for hi sake it wa a
sort of invest of good work which he wa effect in the
name of hi young brother it wa a stock of good work which he
wish to amass in advanc for him in case the littl rogu
should some dai find himself short of that coin the onli sort
which is receiv at the tollbar of paradis
he baptiz hi adopt child and gave him the name of
quasimodo either becaus he desir therebi to mark the dai
when he had found him or becaus he wish to design by that
name to what a degre the poor littl creatur wa incomplet
and hardli sketch out in fact quasimodo blind hunchback

now in 1482 quasimodo had grown up he had becom a few year
previous the bellring of notredam thank to hi father by

thank to hi suzerain messir loui de beaumontwho had becom
bishop of pari at the death of guillaum chartier in 1472
thank to hi patron olivi le daim barber to loui xi king
by the grace of god
so quasimodo wa the ringer of the chime of notredam
in the cours of time there had been form a certain peculiarli
intim bond which unit the ringer to the church separ
forev from the world by the doubl fatal of hi unknown
birth and hi natur deform imprison from hi infanc in
that impass doubl circl the poor wretch had grown us to
see noth in thi world beyond the religi wall which had
receiv him under their shadow notredam had been to him
success as he grew up and develop the egg the nest the
hous the countri the univers
there wa certainli a sort of mysteri and preexist harmoni
between thi creatur and thi church when still a littl
fellow he had drag himself tortuous and by jerk beneath
the shadow of it vault he seem with hi human face and hi
bestial limb the natur reptil of that humid and sombr
pavement upon which the shadow of the romanesqu capit cast
so mani strang form
later on the first time that he caught hold mechan of
the rope to the tower and hung suspend from them and set

claud the effect of a child whose tongu is unloos and who
begin to speak
it is thu that littl by littl develop alwai in sympathi

to resembl it he incrust himself in it so to speak and
becam an integr part of it hi salient angl fit into the

than that it natur tenant on might almost sai that he had
assum it form as the snail take on the form of it shell it

him and the old church so profound an instinct sympathi so

adher to it somewhat as a tortois adher to it shell the
rough and wrinkl cathedr wa hi shell
it is useless to warn the reader not to take liter all the
simil which we ar oblig to emploi here to express the
singular symmetr direct almost consubstanti union of a
man and an edific it is equal unnecessari to state to what a
degre that whole cathedr wa familiar to him after so long
and so intim a cohabit that dwell wa peculiar to
him it had no depth to which quasimodo had not penetr no
height which he had not scale he often climb mani stone up
the front aid sole by the uneven point of the carv the
tower on whose exterior surfac he wa frequent seen
clamber like a lizard glide along a perpendicular wall
those two gigant twin so lofti so menac so formid
possess for him neither vertigo nor terror nor shock of
amaz
to see them so gentl under hi hand so easi to scale on would
have said that he had tame them by dint of leap climb
gambol amid the abyss of the gigant cathedr he had
becom in some sort a monkei and a goat like the calabrian
child who swim befor he walk and plai with the sea while
still a babe
moreov it wa not hi bodi alon which seem fashion after
the cathedr but hi mind also in what condit wa that
mind what bent had it contract what form had it assum
beneath that knot envelop in that savag life thi it would
be hard to determin quasimodo had been born oneei
hunchback lame it wa with great difficulti and by dint of
great patienc that claud frollo had succeed in teach him
to talk but a fatal wa attach to the poor foundl
bellring of notredam at the ag of fourteen a new infirm
had come to complet hi misfortun the bell had broken the
drum of hi ear he had becom deaf the onli gate which natur
had left wide open for him had been abruptli close and forev
in close it had cut off the onli rai of joi and of light which
still made it wai into the soul of quasimodo hi soul fell into
profound night the wretch be miseri becam as incur
and as complet as hi deform let us add that hi deaf
render him to some extent dumb for in order not to make
other laugh the veri moment that he found himself to be deaf
he resolv upon a silenc which he onli broke when he wa alon
he voluntarili ti that tongu which claud frollo had taken so
much pain to unloos henc it came about that when necess
constrain him to speak hi tongu wa torpid awkward and
like a door whose hing have grown rusti
if now we were to try to penetr to the soul of quasimodo
through that thick hard rind if we could sound the depth of
that badli construct organ if it were grant to us to look
with a torch behind those nontranspar organ to explor the
shadowi interior of that opaqu creatur to elucid hi
obscur corner hi absurd nothoroughfar and suddenli to
cast a vivid light upon the soul enchain at the extrem of
that cave we should no doubt find the unhappi psych in some
poor cramp and ricketti attitud like those prison
beneath the lead of venic who grew old bent doubl in a stone
box which wa both too low and too short for them
it is certain that the mind becom atrophi in a defect
bodi quasimodo wa bare consciou of a soul cast in hi own
imag move blindli within him the impress of object
underw a consider refract befor reach hi mind hi
brain wa a peculiar medium the idea which pass through it
issu forth complet distort the reflect which result
from thi refract wa necessarili diverg and pervert
henc a thousand optic illus a thousand aberr of
judgment a thousand deviat in which hi thought strai
now mad now idiot
the first effect of thi fatal organ wa to troubl the
glanc which he cast upon thing he receiv hardli ani
immedi percept of them the extern world seem much
farther awai to him than it doe to us
the second effect of hi misfortun wa to render him malici
he wa malici in fact becaus he wa savag he wa savag
becaus he wa ugli there wa logic in hi natur as there is
in our
hi strength so extraordinarili develop wa a caus of still
greater malevol malu puer robustu sai hobb
thi justic must howev be render to him malevol wa
not perhap innat in him from hi veri first step among men
he had felt himself later on he had seen himself spew out
blast reject human word were for him alwai a railleri
or a maledict as he grew up he had found noth but hatr
around him he had caught the gener malevol he had pick
up the weapon with which he had been wound
after all he turn hi face toward men onli with reluct
hi cathedr wa suffici for him it wa peopl with marbl
figuresk saint bishopswho at least did not burst out
laugh in hi face and who gaze upon him onli with
tranquil and kindli the other statu those of the
monster and demon cherish no hatr for him quasimodo he
resembl them too much for that thei seem rather to be
scof at other men the saint were hi friend and bless
him the monster were hi friend and guard him so he held
long communion with them he sometim pass whole hour
crouch befor on of these statu in solitari convers
with it if ani on came he fled like a lover surpris in hi
serenad
and the cathedr wa not onli societi for him but the univers
and all natur besid he dream of no other hedgerow than the
paint window alwai in flower no other shade than that of
the foliag of stone which spread out load with bird in the
tuft of the saxon capit of no other mountain than the
coloss tower of the church of no other ocean than pari
roar at their base
what he love abov all els in the matern edific that which
arous hi soul and made it open it poor wing which it kept
so miser fold in it cavern that which sometim render
him even happi wa the bell he love them fondl them
talk to them understood them from the chime in the spire
over the intersect of the aisl and nave to the great bell
of the front he cherish a tender for them all the central
spire and the two tower were to him as three great cage whose
bird rear by himself sang for him alon yet it wa these
veri bell which had made him deaf but mother often love best
that child which ha caus them the most suffer
it is true that their voic wa the onli on which he could still
hear on thi score the big bell wa hi belov it wa she
whom he prefer out of all that famili of noisi girl which
bustl abov him on festiv dai thi bell wa name mari
she wa alon in the southern tower with her sister jacquelin
a bell of lesser size shut up in a smaller cage besid her
thi jacquelin wa so call from the name of the wife of jean
montagu who had given it to the church which had not prevent
hi go and figur without hi head at montfaucon in the
second tower there were six other bell and final six
smaller on inhabit the belfri over the cross with the

faster than ani on els could have descend it he enter

breath which is audibl leagu awai quasimodo station
himself in front of thi open throat he crouch and rose with
the oscil of the bell breath in thi overwhelm
breath gaze by turn at the deep place which swarm with
peopl two hundr feet below him and at that enorm brazen
tongu which came second after second to howl in hi ear
it wa the onli speech which he understood the onli sound which
broke for him the univers silenc he swell out in it as a
bird doe in the sun all of a sudden the frenzi of the bell
seiz upon him hi look becam extraordinari he lai in wait
for the great bell as it pass as a spider li in wait for a
fly and flung himself abruptli upon it with might and main
then suspend abov the abyss born to and fro by the
formid swing of the bell he seiz the brazen monster by
the earlap press it between both knee spur it on with
hi heel and redoubl the furi of the peal with the whole
shock and weight of hi bodi meanwhil the tower trembl he
shriek and gnash hi teeth hi red hair rose erect hi
breast heav like a bellow hi ey flash flame the
monstrou bell neigh pant beneath him and then it wa no
longer the great bell of notredam nor quasimodo it wa a
dream a whirlwind a tempest dizzi mount astrid of
nois a spirit cling to a fly crupper a strang centaur
half man half bell a sort of horribl astolphu born awai
upon a prodigi hippogriff of live bronz
the presenc of thi extraordinari be caus as it were a
breath of life to circul throughout the entir cathedr it
seem as though there escap from him at least accord to
the grow superstit of the crowd a mysteri eman
which anim all the stone of notredam and made the deep
bowel of the ancient church to palpit it suffic for peopl
to know that he wa there to make them believ that thei beheld
the thousand statu of the galleri and the front in motion
and the cathedr did inde seem a docil and obedi creatur
beneath hi hand it wait on hi will to rais it great voic
it wa possess and fill with quasimodo as with a familiar
spirit on would have said that he made the immens edific
breath he wa everywher about it in fact he multipli
himself on all point of the structur now on perceiv with
affright at the veri top of on of the tower a fantast dwarf
climb writh crawl on all four descend outsid
abov the abyss leap from project to project and go
to ransack the belli of some sculptur gorgon it wa quasimodo
dislodg the crow again in some obscur corner of the church
on came in contact with a sort of live chimera crouch and
scowl it wa quasimodo engag in thought sometim on
caught sight upon a bell tower of an enorm head and a bundl
of disord limb swing furious at the end of a rope it
wa quasimodo ring vesper or the angelu often at night a
hideou form wa seen wander along the frail balustrad of
carv lacework which crown the tower and border the
circumfer of the aps again it wa the hunchback of
notredam then said the women of the neighborhood the whole
church took on someth fantast supernatur horribl ey
and mouth were open here and there on heard the dog the
monster and the gargoyl of stone which keep watch night and
dai with outstretch neck and open jaw around the monstrou
cathedr bark and if it wa a christma ev while the
great bell which seem to emit the death rattl summon the
faith to the midnight mass such an air wa spread over the
sombr faad that on would have declar that the grand portal
wa devour the throng and that the rose window wa watch
it and all thi came from quasimodo egypt would have taken him
for the god of thi templ the middl ag believ him to be
it demon he wa in fact it soul
to such an extent wa thi diseas that for those who know that
quasimodo ha exist notredam is todai desert inanim
dead on feel that someth ha disappear from it that
immens bodi is empti it is a skeleton the spirit ha quit
it on see it place and that is all it is like a skull which
still ha hole for the ey but no longer sight
chapter iv the dog and hi master
nevertheless there wa on human creatur whom quasimodo
except from hi malic and from hi hatr for other and whom
he love even more perhap than hi cathedr thi wa claud
frollo
the matter wa simpl claud frollo had taken him in had
adopt him had nourish him had rear him when a littl
lad it wa between claud frollo leg that he wa accustom
to seek refug when the dog and the children bark after him
claud frollo had taught him to talk to read to write claud
frollo had final made him the bellring now to give the big
bell in marriag to quasimodo wa to give juliet to romeo
henc quasimodo gratitud wa profound passion boundless
and although the visag of hi adopt father wa often cloud
or sever although hi speech wa habitu curt harsh
imperi that gratitud never waver for a singl moment the
archdeacon had in quasimodo the most submiss slave the most
docil lackei the most vigil of dog when the poor
bellring becam deaf there had been establish between him
and claud frollo a languag of sign mysteri and understood
by themselv alon in thi manner the archdeacon wa the sole
human be with whom quasimodo had preserv commun he
wa in sympathi with but two thing in thi world notredam and
claud frollo
there is noth which can be compar with the empir of the
archdeacon over the bellring with the attach of the
bellring for the archdeacon a sign from claud and the idea of
give him pleasur would have suffic to make quasimodo hurl
himself headlong from the summit of notredam it wa a
remark thingal that physic strength which had reach in
quasimodo such an extraordinari develop and which wa place
by him blindli at the disposit of anoth there wa in it no
doubt filial devot domest attach there wa also the
fascin of on spirit by anoth spirit it wa a poor
awkward and clumsi organ which stood with lower head
and supplic ey befor a lofti and profound a power and
superior intellect lastli and abov all it wa gratitud
gratitud so push to it extremest limit that we do not know
to what to compar it thi virtu is not on of those of which
the finest exampl ar to be met with among men we will sai
then that quasimodo love the archdeacon as never a dog never a
hors never an eleph love hi master
chapter v more about claud frollo
in 1482 quasimodo wa about twenti year of ag claud frollo
about thirtysix on had grown up the other had grown old
claud frollo wa no longer the simpl scholar of the colleg of
torchi the tender protector of a littl child the young and
dreami philosoph who knew mani thing and wa ignor of mani
he wa a priest auster grave moros on charg with soul
monsieur the archdeacon of josa the bishop second acolyt
have charg of the two deaneri of montlhri and chteaufort
and on hundr and seventyfour countri curaci he wa an
impos and sombr personag befor whom the choir boi in alb
and in jacket trembl as well as the machicots25 and the
brother of saintaugustin and the matutin clerk of
notredam when he pass slowli beneath the lofti arch of the
choir majest thought with arm fold and hi head so
bent upon hi breast that all on saw of hi face wa hi larg
bald brow
dom claud frollo had howev abandon neither scienc nor the
educ of hi young brother those two occup of hi
life but as time went on some bitter had been mingl with
these thing which were so sweet in the long run sai paul
diacr the best lard turn rancid littl jehan frollo surnam
du moulin of the mill becaus of the place where he had
been rear had not grown up in the direct which claud would
have like to impos upon him the big brother count upon a
piou docil learn and honor pupil but the littl
brother like those young tree which deceiv the garden
hope and turn obstin to the quarter whenc thei receiv sun
and air the littl brother did not grow and did not multipli
but onli put forth fine bushi and luxuri branch on the side
of lazi ignor and debaucheri he wa a regular devil
and a veri disorderli on who made dom claud scowl but veri
droll and veri subtl which made the big brother smile
claud had confid him to that same colleg of torchi where he
had pass hi earli year in studi and medit and it wa a
grief to him that thi sanctuari formerli edifi by the name of
frollo should todai be scandal by it he sometim preach
jehan veri long and sever sermon which the latter intrepidli
endur after all the young scapegrac had a good heart as can
be seen in all comedi but the sermon over he none the less
tranquilli resum hi cours of sedit and enorm now it
wa a bjaun or yellow beak as thei call the new arriv
at the univers whom he had been maul by wai of welcom a
preciou tradit which ha been carefulli preserv to our own
dai again he had set in movement a band of scholar who had
flung themselv upon a wineshop in classic fashion quasi
classico excitati had then beaten the tavernkeep with
offens cudgel and joyous pillag the tavern even to
smash in the hogshead of wine in the cellar and then it wa
a fine report in latin which the submonitor of torchi carri
piteous to dom claud with thi dolor margin
commentrixa prima causa vinum optimum potatum final it
wa said a thing quit horribl in a boi of sixteen that hi
debaucheri often extend as far as the rue de glatigni
claud sadden and discourag in hi human affect by all
thi had flung himself eagerli into the arm of learn that
sister which at least doe not laugh in your face and which
alwai pai you though in monei that is sometim a littl
hollow for the attent which you have paid to her henc he
becam more and more learn and at the same time as a natur
consequ more and more rigid as a priest more and more sad
as a man there ar for each of us sever parallel between
our intellig our habit and our charact which develop
without a break and break onli in the great disturb of
life
as claud frollo had pass through nearli the entir circl of
human learningposit exterior and permissiblesinc hi
youth he wa oblig unless he came to a halt ubi defuit
orbi to proce further and seek other aliment for the
insati activ of hi intellig the antiqu symbol of
the serpent bite it tail is abov all applic to scienc
it would appear that claud frollo had experienc thi mani
grave person affirm that after have exhaust the fa of
human learn he had dare to penetr into the nefa he
had thei said tast in success all the appl of the tree
of knowledg and whether from hunger or disgust had end by
tast the forbidden fruit he had taken hi place by turn as
the reader ha seen in the confer of the theologian in
sorbonnein the assembl of the doctor of art after the
manner of sainthilairein the disput of the decretalist
after the manner of saintmartinin the congreg of
physician at the holi water font of notredam ad cupam
nostrdomin all the dish permit and approv which
those four great kitchen call the four faculti could
elabor and serv to the understand he had devour and
had been satiat with them befor hi hunger wa appeas then
he had penetr further lower beneath all that finish
materi limit knowledg he had perhap risk hi soul
and had seat himself in the cavern at that mysteri tabl of
the alchemist of the astrolog of the hermet of which
averro guillaum de pari and nicola flamel hold the end in
the middl ag and which extend in the east by the light of
the sevenbranch candlestick to solomon pythagora and
zoroast
that is at least what wa suppos whether rightli or not it
is certain that the archdeacon often visit the cemeteri of the
saintsinnoc where it is true hi father and mother had
been buri with other victim of the plagu of 1466 but that
he appear far less devout befor the cross of their grave than
befor the strang figur with which the tomb of nicola flamel
and claud pernel erect just besid it wa load
it is certain that he had frequent been seen to pass along the
rue de lombard and furtiv enter a littl hous which form
the corner of the rue de ecrivan and the rue marivault it wa
the hous which nicola flamel had built where he had di about
1417 and which constantli desert sinc that time had alreadi
begun to fall in ruinsso greatli had the hermet and the
alchemist of all countri wast awai the wall mere by
carv their name upon them some neighbor even affirm that
thei had onc seen through an airhol archdeacon claud
excav turn over dig up the earth in the two
cellar whose support had been daub with numberless couplet
and hieroglyph by nicola flamel himself it wa suppos that
flamel had buri the philosoph stone in the cellar and the
alchemist for the space of two centuri from magistri to
father pacifiqu never ceas to worri the soil until the hous
so cruelli ransack and turn over end by fall into dust
beneath their feet
again it is certain that the archdeacon had been seiz with a
singular passion for the symbol door of notredam that page
of a conjur book written in stone by bishop guillaum de
pari who ha no doubt been damn for have affix so
infern a frontispiec to the sacr poem chant by the rest of
the edific archdeacon claud had the credit also of have
fathom the mysteri of the colossu of saint christoph and of
that lofti enigmat statu which then stood at the entranc
of the vestibul and which the peopl in deris call
monsieur legri but what everi on might have notic wa the
intermin hour which he often emploi seat upon the
parapet of the area in front of the church in contempl the
sculptur of the front examin now the foolish virgin with
their lamp revers now the wise virgin with their lamp
upright again calcul the angl of vision of that raven
which belong to the left front and which is look at a
mysteri point insid the church where is conceal the
philosoph stone if it be not in the cellar of nicola
flamel
it wa let us remark in pass a singular fate for the church
of notredam at that epoch to be so belov in two differ
degre and with so much devot by two be so dissimilar
as claud and quasimodo belov by on a sort of instinct
and savag halfman for it beauti for it statur for the
harmoni which eman from it magnific ensembl belov
by the other a learn and passion imagin for it myth
for the sens which it contain for the symbol scatter
beneath the sculptur of it frontlik the first text
underneath the second in a palimpsestin a word for the enigma
which it is etern propound to the understand
furthermor it is certain that the archdeacon had establish
himself in that on of the two tower which look upon the grve
just besid the frame for the bell a veri secret littl cell
into which no on not even the bishop enter without hi
leav it wa said thi tini cell had formerli been made almost
at the summit of the tower among the raven nest by bishop
hugo de besanon26 who had wrought sorceri there in hi dai
what that cell contain no on knew but from the strand of the
terrain at night there wa often seen to appear disappear and
reappear at brief and regular interv at a littl dormer
window open upon the back of the tower a certain red
intermitt singular light which seem to follow the pant
breath of a bellow and to proce from a flame rather than
from a light in the dark at that height it produc a
singular effect and the goodwiv said there the archdeacon
blow hell is sparkl up yonder
there were no great proof of sorceri in that after all but
there wa still enough smoke to warrant a surmis of fire and
the archdeacon bore a toler formid reput we ought
to mention howev that the scienc of egypt that necrom
and magic even the whitest even the most innoc had no more
envenom enemi no more pitiless denunci befor the
gentlemen of the officialti of notredam whether thi wa
sincer horror or the game plai by the thief who shout stop
thief at all event it did not prevent the archdeacon from
be consid by the learn head of the chapter as a soul
who had ventur into the vestibul of hell who wa lost in the
cave of the cabal grope amid the shadow of the occult
scienc neither were the peopl deceiv therebi with ani on
who possess ani sagac quasimodo pass for the demon
claud frollo for the sorcer it wa evid that the
bellring wa to serv the archdeacon for a given time at the
end of which he would carri awai the latter soul by wai of
payment thu the archdeacon in spite of the excess auster
of hi life wa in bad odor among all piou soul and there wa
no devout nose so inexperienc that it could not smell him out
to be a magician
and if as he grew older abyss had form in hi scienc thei
had also form in hi heart that at least is what on had
ground for believ on scrutin that face upon which the
soul wa onli seen to shine through a sombr cloud whenc that
larg bald brow that head forev bent that breast alwai
heav with sigh what secret thought caus hi mouth to smile
with so much bitter at the same moment that hi scowl
brow approach each other like two bull on the point of
fight why wa what hair he had left alreadi grai what wa
that intern fire which sometim broke forth in hi glanc to
such a degre that hi ey resembl a hole pierc in the wall
of a furnac
these symptom of a violent moral preoccup had acquir an
especi high degre of intens at the epoch when thi stori
take place more than onc a choirboi had fled in terror at
find him alon in the church so strang and dazzl wa hi
look more than onc in the choir at the hour of the offic
hi neighbor in the stall had heard him mingl with the plain
song ad omnem tonum unintellig parenthes more than
onc the laundress of the terrain charg with wash the
chapter had observ not without affright the mark of nail
and clench finger on the surplic of monsieur the archdeacon
of josa
howev he redoubl hi sever and had never been more
exemplari by profess as well as by charact he had alwai
held himself aloof from women he seem to hate them more than
ever the mere rustl of a silken petticoat caus hi hood to
fall over hi ey upon thi score he wa so jealou of
auster and reserv that when the dame de beaujeu the king
daughter came to visit the cloister of notredam in the month
of decemb 1481 he grave oppos her entranc remind the
bishop of the statut of the black book date from the vigil of
saintbarthlemi 1334 which interdict access to the cloister
to ani woman whatev old or young mistress or maid upon
which the bishop had been constrain to recit to him the
ordin of legat odo which except certain great dame
aliqu magnat mulier qu sine scandalo vitari non possunt
and again the archdeacon had protest object that the
ordin of the legat which date back to 1207 wa anterior
by a hundr and twentyseven year to the black book and
consequ wa abrog in fact by it and he had refus to
appear befor the princess
it wa also notic that hi horror for bohemian women and
gypsi had seem to redoubl for some time past he had
petit the bishop for an edict which expressli forbad the
bohemian women to come and danc and beat their tambourin on
the place of the parvi and for about the same length of time
he had been ransack the mouldi placard of the officialti in
order to collect the case of sorcer and witch condemn to
fire or the rope for complic in crime with ram sow or
goat
chapter vi unpopular
the archdeacon and the bellring as we have alreadi said were
but littl love by the populac great and small in the vicin
of the cathedr when claud and quasimodo went out togeth
which frequent happen and when thei were seen travers in
compani the valet behind the master the cold narrow and
gloomi street of the block of notredam more than on evil
word more than on iron quaver more than on insult jest
greet them on their wai unless claud frollo which wa rare
the case walk with head upright and rais show hi sever
and almost august brow to the dumbfound jeerer
both were in their quarter like the poet of whom rgnier
speak
all sort of person run after poet
as warbler fly shriek after owl
sometim a mischiev child risk hi skin and bone for the
ineff pleasur of drive a pin into quasimodo hump again
a young girl more bold and sauci than wa fit brush the
priest black robe sing in hi face the sardon ditti
nich nich the devil is caught sometim a group of
squalid old crone squat in a file under the shadow of the
step to a porch scold noisili as the archdeacon and the
bellring pass and toss them thi encourag welcom with
a curs hum there a fellow whose soul is made like the other
on bodi or a band of schoolboi and street urchin plai
hopscotch rose in a bodi and salut him classic with some
cry in latin eia eia claudiu cum claudo
but the insult gener pass unnot both by the priest and
the bellring quasimodo wa too deaf to hear all these graciou
thing and claud wa too dreami
book fifth
chapter i abba beati martini
dom claud fame had spread far and wide it procur for him
at about the epoch when he refus to see madam de beaujeu a
visit which he long rememb
it wa in the even he had just retir after the offic to
hi canon cell in the cloister of notredam thi cell with
the except possibl of some glass phial releg to a
corner and fill with a decidedli equivoc powder which
strongli resembl the alchemist powder of project
present noth strang or mysteri there were inde here
and there some inscript on the wall but thei were pure
sentenc of learn and pieti extract from good author the
archdeacon had just seat himself by the light of a
threejet copper lamp befor a vast coffer cram with
manuscript he had rest hi elbow upon the open volum of
honoriu dautun de predestination et libero arbitrio and he
wa turn over in deep medit the leav of a print
folio which he had just brought the sole product of the press
which hi cell contain in the midst of hi reveri there came a
knock at hi door who there cri the learn man in the
graciou tone of a famish dog disturb over hi bone
a voic without repli your friend jacqu coictier he went
to open the door
it wa in fact the king physician a person about fifti year

ey anoth man accompani him both wore long slatecolor
robe fur with minev gird and close with cap of the
same stuff and hue their hand were conceal by their sleev
their feet by their robe their ey by their cap
god help me messieur said the archdeacon show them in
i wa not expect distinguish visitor at such an hour and
while speak in thi courteou fashion he cast an uneasi and
scrutin glanc from the physician to hi companion
ti never too late to come and pai a visit to so consider a
learn man as dom claud frollo de tirechapp repli doctor
coictier whose franchecomt accent made all hi phrase drag
along with the majesti of a trainrob
there then ensu between the physician and the archdeacon on of
those congratulatori prologu which in accord with custom
at that epoch preced all convers between learn men and
which did not prevent them from detest each other in the most
cordial manner in the world howev it is the same nowadai
everi wise man mouth compliment anoth wise man is a vase
of honei gall
claud frollo felicit to jacqu coictier bore refer
princip to the tempor advantag which the worthi physician
had found mean to extract in the cours of hi much envi
career from each maladi of the king an oper of alchemi
much better and more certain than the pursuit of the
philosoph stone
in truth monsieur le docteur coictier i felt great joi on
learn of the bishopr given your nephew my reverend seigneur
pierr ver is he not bishop of amien
ye monsieur archdeacon it is a grace and merci of god

which peopl make so much nois about is worth not sixti gold

in the compliment which dom claud address to jacqu
coictier there wa that sardon bite and covertli mock
accent and the sad cruel smile of a superior and unhappi man who
toi for a moment by wai of distract with the dens
prosper of a vulgar man the other did not perceiv it
upon my soul said claud at length press hi hand i am
glad to see you and in such good health
thank master claud
by the wai exclaim dom claud how is your royal patient
he payeth not suffici hi physician repli the doctor
cast a side glanc at hi companion
think you so gossip coictier said the latter
these word utter in a tone of surpris and reproach drew
upon thi unknown personag the attent of the archdeacon
which to tell the truth had not been divert from him a singl
moment sinc the stranger had set foot across the threshold of
hi cell it had even requir all the thousand reason which he
had for handl tenderli doctor jacqu coictier the
allpow physician of king loui xi to induc him to
receiv the latter thu accompani henc there wa noth
veri cordial in hi manner when jacqu coictier said to him
by the wai dom claud i bring you a colleagu who ha desir
to see you on account of your reput
monsieur belong to scienc ask the archdeacon fix hi
pierc ey upon coictier companion he found beneath the
brow of the stranger a glanc no less pierc or less
distrust than hi own
he wa so far as the feebl light of the lamp permit on to
judg an old man about sixti year of ag and of medium statur
who appear somewhat sickli and broken in health hi profil
although of a veri ordinari outlin had someth power and
sever about it hi ey sparkl beneath a veri deep
superciliari arch like a light in the depth of a cave and
beneath hi cap which wa well drawn down and fell upon hi nose
on recogn the broad expans of a brow of geniu
he took it upon himself to repli to the archdeacon question
reverend master he said in a grave tone your renown ha
reach my ear and i wish to consult you i am but a poor
provinci gentleman who removeth hi shoe befor enter the
dwell of the learn you must know my name i am call
gossip tourangeau
strang name for a gentleman said the archdeacon to himself
nevertheless he had a feel that he wa in the presenc of a
strong and earnest charact the instinct of hi own lofti
intellect made him recogn an intellect no less lofti under
gossip tourangeau fur cap and as he gaze at the solemn
face the iron smile which jacqu coictier presenc call
forth on hi gloomi face gradual disappear as twilight fade
on the horizon of night stern and silent he had resum hi
seat in hi great armchair hi elbow rest as usual on the
tabl and hi brow on hi hand after a few moment of
reflect he motion hi visitor to be seat and turn
to gossip tourangeau he said
you come to consult me master and upon what scienc
your rever repli tourangeau i am ill veri ill you
ar said to be great sculapiu and i am come to ask your advic
in medicin
medicin said the archdeacon toss hi head he seem to
medit for a moment and then resum gossip tourangeau
sinc that is your name turn your head you will find my repli
alreadi written on the wall
gossip tourangeau obei and read thi inscript engrav
abov hi head medicin is the daughter of
dreamsjambliqu
meanwhil doctor jacqu coictier had heard hi companion
question with a displeasur which dom claud respons had but
redoubl he bent down to the ear of gossip tourangeau and said
to him softli enough not to be heard by the archdeacon i
warn you that he wa mad you insist on see him
ti veri possibl that he is right madman as he is doctor
jacqu repli hi comrad in the same low tone and with a
bitter smile
as you pleas repli coictier dryli then address the
archdeacon you ar clever at your trade dom claud and you
ar no more at a loss over hippocr than a monkei is over a
nut medicin a dream i suspect that the pharmacopolist and the
master physician would insist upon stone you if thei were
here so you deni the influenc of philtr upon the blood and
unguent on the skin you deni that etern pharmaci of flower
and metal which is call the world made expressli for that
etern invalid call man
i deni said dom claud coldli neither pharmaci nor the
invalid i reject the physician
then it is not true resum coictier hotli that gout is an
intern erupt that a wound caus by artilleri is to be
cure by the applic of a young mous roast that young
blood properli inject restor youth to ag vein it is not
true that two and two make four and that emprostathono follow
opistathono
the archdeacon repli without perturb there ar certain
thing of which i think in a certain fashion
coictier becam crimson with anger
there there my good coictier let us not get angri said
gossip tourangeau monsieur the archdeacon is our friend
coictier calm down mutter in a low tone
after all he mad
pasquedieu master claud resum gossip tourangeau after
a silenc you embarrass me greatli i had two thing to consult
you upon on touch my health and the other touch my star
monsieur return the archdeacon if that be your motiv you
would have done as well not to put yourself out of breath
climb my staircas i do not believ in medicin i do not
believ in astrolog
inde said the man with surpris
coictier gave a forc laugh
you see that he is mad he said in a low tone to gossip
tourangeau he doe not believ in astrolog
the idea of imagin pursu dom claud that everi rai of a
star is a thread which is fasten to the head of a man
and what then do you believ in exclaim gossip tourangeau
the archdeacon hesit for a moment then he allow a gloomi
smile to escap which seem to give the lie to hi respons
credo in deum
dominum nostrum ad gossip tourangeau make the sign of
the cross
amen said coictier
reverend master resum tourangeau i am charm in soul to
see you in such a religi frame of mind but have you reach
the point great savant as you ar of no longer believ in

and a rai of enthusiasm light up hi gloomi ey no i do not
reject scienc i have not crawl so long flat on my belli
with my nail in the earth through the innumer ramif
of it cavern without perceiv far in front of me at the end
of the obscur galleri a light a flame a someth the
reflect no doubt of the dazzl central laboratori where

the immens church of notredam which outlin against the

flank it monstrou haunch seem an enorm twohead
sphinx seat in the middl of the citi
the archdeacon gaze at the gigant edific for some time in

print book which lai open on the tabl and hi left toward
notredam and turn a sad glanc from the book to the

he took leav of the archdeacon i love wise men and great
mind and i hold you in singular esteem come tomorrow to the
palac de tournel and inquir for the abb de saintemartin

the archdeacon return to hi chamber dumbfound comprehend
at last who gossip tourangeau wa and recal that passag of
the regist of saintemartin of toursabba beati martini
scilicet rex franci est canonicu de consuetudin et habet
parvam prbendam quam habet sanctu venantiu et debet seder in
sede thesaurarii
it is assert that after that epoch the archdeacon had frequent
confer with loui xi when hi majesti came to pari and
that dom claud influenc quit overshadow that of olivi le
daim and jacqu coictier who as wa hi habit rude took the
king to task on that account
chapter ii thi will kill that
our ladi reader will pardon us if we paus for a moment to seek
what could have been the thought conceal beneath those
enigmat word of the archdeacon thi will kill that the book
will kill the edific
to our mind thi thought had two face in the first place it
wa a priestli thought it wa the affright of the priest in the
presenc of a new agent the print press it wa the terror
and dazzl amaz of the men of the sanctuari in the
presenc of the lumin press of gutenberg it wa the pulpit
and the manuscript take the alarm at the print word
someth similar to the stupor of a sparrow which should behold
the angel legion unfold hi six million wing it wa the cry of
the prophet who alreadi hear emancip human roar and
swarm who behold in the futur intellig sap faith
opinion dethron belief the world shake off rome it wa the
prognost of the philosoph who see human thought
volatil by the press evapor from the theocrat
recipi it wa the terror of the soldier who examin the
brazen batter ram and saysth tower will crumbl it
signifi that on power wa about to succe anoth power it
meant the press will kill the church
but underli thi thought the first and most simpl on no
doubt there wa in our opinion anoth newer on a corollari
of the first less easi to perceiv and more easi to contest a
view as philosoph and belong no longer to the priest alon
but to the savant and the artist it wa a presenti that
human thought in chang it form wa about to chang it mode
of express that the domin idea of each gener would no
longer be written with the same matter and in the same manner
that the book of stone so solid and so durabl wa about to
make wai for the book of paper more solid and still more
durabl in thi connect the archdeacon vagu formula had a
second sens it meant print will kill architectur
in fact from the origin of thing down to the fifteenth centuri
of the christian era inclus architectur is the great book
of human the princip express of man in hi differ
stage of develop either as a forc or as an intellig
when the memori of the first race felt itself overload when
the mass of reminisc of the human race becam so heavi and
so confus that speech nake and fly ran the risk of lose
them on the wai men transcrib them on the soil in a manner
which wa at onc the most visibl most durabl and most
natur thei seal each tradit beneath a monument
the first monument were simpl mass of rock which the iron
had not touch as mose sai architectur began like all
write it wa first an alphabet men plant a stone upright
it wa a letter and each letter wa a hieroglyph and upon each
hieroglyph rest a group of idea like the capit on the
column thi is what the earliest race did everywher at the
same moment on the surfac of the entir world we find the
stand stone of the celt in asian siberia in the pampa of
america
later on thei made word thei place stone upon stone thei
coupl those syllabl of granit and attempt some
combin the celtic dolmen and cromlech the etruscan
tumulu the hebrew galgal ar word some especi the
tumulu ar proper name sometim even when men had a great
deal of stone and a vast plain thei wrote a phrase the immens
pile of karnac is a complet sentenc
at last thei made book tradit had brought forth symbol
beneath which thei disappear like the trunk of a tree beneath
it foliag all these symbol in which human place faith
continu to grow to multipli to intersect to becom more and
more complic the first monument no longer suffic to
contain them thei were overflow in everi part these
monument hardli express now the primit tradit simpl
like themselv nake and prone upon the earth the symbol felt
the need of expans in the edific then architectur wa
develop in proport with human thought it becam a giant
with a thousand head and a thousand arm and fix all thi
float symbol in an etern visibl palpabl form while
ddalu who is forc measur while orpheu who is
intellig sangth pillar which is a letter the arcad
which is a syllabl the pyramid which is a wordal set in
movement at onc by a law of geometri and by a law of poetri
group themselv combin amalgam descend ascend
place themselv side by side on the soil rang themselv in
stori in the sky until thei had written under the dictat of
the gener idea of an epoch those marvel book which were
also marvel edific the pagoda of eklinga the rhamseion of
egypt the templ of solomon
the gener idea the word wa not onli at the foundat of
all these edific but also in the form the templ of solomon
for exampl wa not alon the bind of the holi book it wa
the holi book itself on each on of it concentr wall the
priest could read the word translat and manifest to the ey
and thu thei follow it transform from sanctuari to
sanctuari until thei seiz it in it last tabernacl under it
most concret form which still belong to architectur the
arch thu the word wa enclos in an edific but it imag wa
upon it envelop like the human form on the coffin of a mummi
and not onli the form of edific but the site select for
them reveal the thought which thei repres accord as
the symbol to be express wa grace or grave greec crown
her mountain with a templ harmoni to the ey india
disembowel her to chisel therein those monstrou
subterranean pagoda born up by gigant row of granit
eleph
thu dure the first six thousand year of the world from the
most immemori pagoda of hindustan to the cathedr of cologn
architectur wa the great handwrit of the human race and
thi is so true that not onli everi religi symbol but everi
human thought ha it page and it monument in that immens
book
all civil begin in theocraci and end in democraci thi
law of liberti follow uniti is written in architectur for
let us insist upon thi point masonri must not be thought to be
power onli in erect the templ and in express the myth
and sacerdot symbol in inscrib in hieroglyph upon it
page of stone the mysteri tabl of the law if it were
thusa there come in all human societi a moment when the
sacr symbol is worn out and becom obliter under freedom
of thought when man escap from the priest when the
excresc of philosophi and system devour the face of
religionarchitectur could not reproduc thi new state of
human thought it leav so crowd on the face would be empti
on the back it work would be mutil it book would be
incomplet but no
let us take as an exampl the middl ag where we see more
clearli becaus it is nearer to us dure it first period
while theocraci is organ europ while the vatican is
ralli and reclass about itself the element of a rome made
from the rome which li in ruin around the capitol while
christian is seek all the stage of societi amid the
rubbish of anterior civil and rebuild with it ruin a
new hierarch univers the keyston to whose vault is the
prieston first hear a dull echo from that chao and then
littl by littl on see aris from beneath the breath of
christian from beneath the hand of the barbarian from the
fragment of the dead greek and roman architectur that
mysteri romanesqu architectur sister of the theocrat
masonri of egypt and of india inalter emblem of pure
catholic unchang hieroglyph of the papal uniti all the
thought of that dai is written in fact in thi sombr
romanesqu style on feel everywher in it author uniti
the impenetr the absolut gregori vii alwai the priest
never the man everywher cast never the peopl
but the crusad arriv thei ar a great popular movement and
everi great popular movement whatev mai be it caus and
object alwai set free the spirit of liberti from it final
precipit new thing spring into life everi dai here open
the stormi period of the jacqueri pragueri and leagu
author waver uniti is divid feudal demand to share
with theocraci while await the inevit arriv of the
peopl who will assum the part of the lion quia nominor leo
seignori pierc through sacerdot the common through
seignori the face of europ is chang well the face of
architectur is chang also like civil it ha turn a
page and the new spirit of the time find her readi to write at
it dictat it return from the crusad with the point
arch like the nation with liberti
then while rome is undergo gradual dismember romanesqu
architectur di the hieroglyph desert the cathedr and
betak itself to blazon the donjon keep in order to lend
prestig to feudal the cathedr itself that edific

which the bishop formerli fulfil each race write it line
upon the book as it pass it eras the ancient romanesqu
hieroglyph on the frontispiec of cathedr and at the most
on onli see dogma crop out here and there beneath the new
symbol which it ha deposit the popular draperi hardli permit
the religi skeleton to be suspect on cannot even form an
idea of the liberti which the architect then take even toward
the church there ar capit knit of nun and monk
shamelessli coupl as on the hall of chimnei piec in the

everi form everi deform even ha there a sens which render
it inviol do not ask of hindoo egyptian romanesqu masonri
to reform their design or to improv their statuari everi

architectur it seem as though the rigid of the dogma had
spread over the stone like a sort of second petrifact the
gener characterist of popular masonri on the contrari ar

phidia
if the reader will sum up what we have hitherto briefli veri
briefli indic neglect a thousand proof and also a
thousand object of detail he will be led to thi that
architectur wa down to the fifteenth centuri the chief
regist of human that in that interv not a thought which
is in ani degre complic made it appear in the world
which ha not been work into an edific that everi popular
idea and everi religi law ha had it monument record
that the human race ha in short had no import thought which
it ha not written in stone and why becaus everi thought
either philosoph or religi is interest in perpetu
itself becaus the idea which ha move on gener wish to
move other also and leav a trace now what a precari
immort is that of the manuscript how much more solid
durabl unyield is a book of stone in order to destroi the
written word a torch and a turk ar suffici to demolish the
construct word a social revolut a terrestri revolut
ar requir the barbarian pass over the coliseum the
delug perhap pass over the pyramid
in the fifteenth centuri everyth chang
human thought discov a mode of perpetu itself not onli
more durabl and more resist than architectur but still more
simpl and easi architectur is dethron gutenberg letter
of lead ar about to supersed orpheuss letter of stone
the book is about to kill the edific
the invent of print is the greatest event in histori it is
the mother of revolut it is the mode of express of
human which is total renew it is human thought strip
off on form and don anoth it is the complet and
definit chang of skin of that symbol serpent which sinc
the dai of adam ha repres intellig
in it print form thought is more imperish than ever it
is volatil irresist indestruct it is mingl with the
air in the dai of architectur it made a mountain of itself
and took power possess of a centuri and a place now it
convert itself into a flock of bird scatter itself to the
four wind and occupi all point of air and space at onc
we repeat who doe not perceiv that in thi form it is far more
indel it wa solid it ha becom aliv it pass from
durat in time to immort on can demolish a mass how can
on extirp ubiqu if a flood come the mountain will have
long disappear beneath the wave while the bird will still be
fly about and if a singl ark float on the surfac of the
cataclysm thei will alight upon it will float with it will be
present with it at the eb of the water and the new world
which emerg from thi chao will behold on it awaken the
thought of the world which ha been submerg soar abov it
wing and live
and when on observ that thi mode of express is not onli
the most conserv but also the most simpl the most
conveni the most practic for all when on reflect that
it doe not drag after it bulki baggag and doe not set in
motion a heavi apparatu when on compar thought forc in
order to transform itself into an edific to put in motion four
or five other art and ton of gold a whole mountain of stone
a whole forest of timberwork a whole nation of workmen when
on compar it to the thought which becom a book and for
which a littl paper a littl ink and a pen sufficehow can
on be surpris that human intellig should have quit
architectur for print cut the primit bed of a river
abruptli with a canal hollow out below it level and the river
will desert it bed
behold how begin with the discoveri of print
architectur wither awai littl by littl becom lifeless and
bare how on feel the water sink the sap depart the
thought of the time and of the peopl withdraw from it the
chill is almost impercept in the fifteenth centuri the press
is as yet too weak and at the most draw from power
architectur a superabund of life but practic begin
with the sixteenth centuri the maladi of architectur is
visibl it is no longer the express of societi it becom
classic art in a miser manner from be gallic european
indigen it becom greek and roman from be true and
modern it becom pseudoclass it is thi decad which is
call the renaiss a magnific decad howev for the
ancient gothic geniu that sun which set behind the gigant
press of mayenc still penetr for a while longer with it
rai that whole hybrid pile of latin arcad and corinthian
column
it is that set sun which we mistak for the dawn
nevertheless from the moment when architectur is no longer
anyth but an art like ani other as soon as it is no longer
the total art the sovereign art the tyrant artit ha no
longer the power to retain the other art so thei emancip
themselv break the yoke of the architect and take themselv
off each on in it own direct each on of them gain by
thi divorc isol aggrand everyth sculptur becom
statuari the imag trade becom paint the canon becom
music on would pronounc it an empir dismemb at the death
of it alexand and whose provinc becom kingdom
henc raphael michael angelo jean goujon palestrina those

thought emancip itself in all direct at the same time as
the art the archheret of the middl ag had alreadi made
larg incis into catholic the sixteenth centuri break
religi uniti befor the invent of print reform would
have been mere a schism print convert it into a
revolut take awai the press heresi is enerv whether it
be provid or fate gutenburg is the precursor of luther
nevertheless when the sun of the middl ag is complet set
when the gothic geniu is forev extinct upon the horizon
architectur grow dim lose it color becom more and more
effac the print book the gnaw worm of the edific suck
and devour it it becom bare denud of it foliag and
grow visibl emaci it is petti it is poor it is noth
it no longer express anyth not even the memori of the art
of anoth time reduc to itself abandon by the other art
becaus human thought is abandon it it summon bungler in
place of artist glass replac the paint window the
stonecutt succe the sculptor farewel all sap all
origin all life all intellig it drag along a
lament workshop mendic from copi to copi michael angelo
who no doubt felt even in the sixteenth centuri that it wa
dy had a last idea an idea of despair that titan of art
pile the pantheon on the parthenon and made saintpet at
rome a great work which deserv to remain uniqu the last
origin of architectur the signatur of a giant artist at

if in place of the characterist monument which we have just
describ we examin the gener aspect of art from the
sixteenth to the eighteenth centuri we notic the same phenomena
of decai and phthisi begin with franoi ii the
architectur form of the edific effac itself more and more

toothless and coquettish old architectur from franoi ii to
loui xv the evil ha increas in geometr progress art

perish
meanwhil what becom of print all the life which is leav
architectur come to it in proport as architectur ebb
print swell and grow that capit of forc which human
thought had been expend in edific it henceforth expend in
book thu from the sixteenth centuri onward the press rais
to the level of decai architectur contend with it and kill
it in the seventeenth centuri it is alreadi suffici the
sovereign suffici triumphant suffici establish in
it victori to give to the world the feast of a great literari
centuri in the eighteenth have repos for a long time at the
court of loui xiv it seiz again the old sword of luther
put it into the hand of voltair and rush impetu to the
attack of that ancient europ whose architectur express it
ha alreadi kill at the moment when the eighteenth centuri
come to an end it ha destroi everyth in the nineteenth
it begin to reconstruct
now we ask which of the three art ha realli repres human
thought for the last three centuri which translat it which
express not onli it literari and scholast vagari but it
vast profound univers movement which constantli superpos
itself without a break without a gap upon the human race
which walk a monster with a thousand legsarchitectur or
print
it is print let the reader make no mistak architectur is
dead irretriev slain by the print bookslain becaus it
endur for a shorter timeslain becaus it cost more everi
cathedr repres million let the reader now imagin what an
invest of fund it would requir to rewrit the architectur
book to caus thousand of edific to swarm onc more upon the
soil to return to those epoch when the throng of monument wa
such accord to the statement of an ey wit that on
would have said that the world in shake itself had cast off
it old garment in order to cover itself with a white vestur of
church erat enim ut si mundu ips excutiendo semet
rejecta vetust candidam ecclesiarum vestem indueret glaber
radolphu
a book is so soon made cost so littl and can go so far how
can it surpris us that all human thought flow in thi channel
thi doe not mean that architectur will not still have a fine
monument an isol masterpiec here and there we mai still
have from time to time under the reign of print a column

that of dant in the thirteenth but architectur will no longer
be the social art the collect art the domin art the
grand poem the grand edific the grand work of human will no
longer be built it will be print
and henceforth if architectur should aris again accident
it will no longer be mistress it will be subservi to the law
of literatur which formerli receiv the law from it the
respect posit of the two art will be invert it is
certain that in architectur epoch the poem rare it is true

back hi head and half close hi ey for the sake of more
majesti and imparti so that at that moment he wa both
deaf and blind a doubl condit without which no judg is

written down what the prison ha said thu far
at thi unlucki question a burst of laughter rose from the
clerk tabl caught by the audienc so violent so wild so
contagi so univers that the two deaf men were forc to

that shrug of the shoulder apostroph him indignantli
you have utter a repli knave which deserv the halter do
you know to whom you ar speak
thi salli wa not fit to arrest the explos of gener
merriment it struck all as so whimsic and so ridicul that
the wild laughter even attack the sergeant of the

of their uniform quasimodo alon preserv hi serious for
the good reason that he understood noth of what wa go on
around him the judg more and more irrit thought it hi

howev at the moment when master florian barbedienn wa

approach as near the auditor ear as possibl and said
point to quasimodo that man is deaf
he hope that thi commun of infirm would awaken master
florian interest in behalf of the condemn man but in the
first place we have alreadi observ that master florian did not

term a ladi thei wore neither ring nor gold cross and it wa
easi to see that in their eas thi did not proce from

unfortun and she taught paquett noth but a bit of
embroideri and toymak which did not prevent the littl on
from grow veri larg and remain veri poor thei both dwelt
at reim on the river front rue de follepein mark thi for
i believ it wa thi which brought misfortun to paquett in
61 the year of the coron of our king loui xi whom god

same year of 61 when the two women had neither fagot nor
firewood it wa veri cold which gave la chantefleuri such a
fine color that the men call her paquette31 and mani call
her pquerette32 and she wa ruinedeustach just let me see
you bite that cake if you darew immedi perceiv that she
wa ruin on sundai when she came to church with a gold cross
about her neck at fourteen year of ag do you see first it

child her mother good woman who had never known what to do
except to shut her ey her mother wa dead paquett had no
longer ani on to love in the world or ani on to love her la
chantefleuri had been a poor creatur dure the five year

on moment gervais said oudard whose attent wa less
impati what would be left for the end if all were in the
begin continu mahiett i entreat you that poor
chantefleuri
mahiett went on
so she wa veri sad veri miser and furrow her cheek
with tear but in the midst of her shame her folli her
debaucheri it seem to her that she should be less wild less
shame less dissip if there were someth or some on in
the world whom she could love and who could love her it wa
necessari that it should be a child becaus onli a child could
be suffici innoc for that she had recogn thi fact
after have tri to love a thief the onli man who want her
but after a short time she perceiv that the thief despis
her those women of love requir either a lover or a child to
fill their heart otherwis thei ar veri unhappi as she could
not have a lover she turn wholli toward a desir for a child
and as she had not ceas to be piou she made her constant
prayer to the good god for it so the good god took piti on her
and gave her a littl daughter i will not speak to you of her
joi it wa a furi of tear and caress and kiss she nurs
her child herself made swaddlingband for it out of her
coverlet the onli on which she had on her bed and no longer

have alreadi told you not to eat that cakeit is certain that
littl agn that wa the child name a baptism name for it
wa a long time sinc la chantefleuri had had ani surnameit is
certain that that littl on wa more swath in ribbon and
embroideri than a dauphi of dauphini among other thing
she had a pair of littl shoe the like of which king loui xi
certainli never had her mother had stitch and embroid them
herself she had lavish on them all the delicaci of her art
of embroideress and all the embellish of a robe for the
good virgin thei certainli were the two prettiest littl pink
shoe that could be seen thei were no longer than my thumb and
on had to see the child littl feet come out of them in order
to believ that thei had been abl to get into them ti true
that those littl feet were so small so pretti so rosi rosier
than the satin of the shoe when you have children oudard you
will find that there is noth prettier than those littl hand
and feet
i ask no better said oudard with a sigh but i am wait
until it shall suit the good pleasur of m andri musnier
howev paquett child had more that wa pretti about it
besid it feet i saw her when she wa onli four month old

more crazi over her everi dai she kiss her caress her
tickl her wash her deck her out devour her she lost
her head over her she thank god for her her pretti littl
rosi feet abov all were an endless sourc of wonder thei
were a delirium of joi she wa alwai press her lip to them
and she could never recov from her amaz at their
small she put them into the tini shoe took them out
admir them marvel at them look at the light through
them wa curiou to see them try to walk on her bed and would
gladli have pass her life on her knee put on and take
off the shoe from those feet as though thei had been those of
an infant jesu
the tale is fair and good said gervais in a low tone but
where do gypsi come into all that
here repli mahiett on dai there arriv in reim a veri
queer sort of peopl thei were beggar and vagabond who were
roam over the countri led by their duke and their count

oudard a big and tender woman would have been well pleas to
sigh in compani with mahiett but gervais more curiou had
not finish her question

besid in front of beru stand the two hill of cernai which
hide the tower of the cathedr in reim from view
while chat thu the three worthi bourgeois had arriv
at the place de grve in their absorpt thei had pass the
public breviari of the tourroland without stop and took
their wai mechan toward the pillori around which the
throng wa grow more dens with everi moment it is probabl
that the spectacl which at that moment attract all look in
that direct would have made them forget complet the
rathol and the halt which thei intend to make there if big
eustach six year of ag whom mahiett wa drag along by
the hand had not abruptli recal the object to them mother
said he as though some instinct warn him that the rathol wa
behind him can i eat the cake now
if eustach had been more adroit that is to sai less greedi he
would have continu to wait and would onli have hazard that
simpl question mother can i eat the cake now on their
return to the univers to master andri musnier rue madam
la valenc when he had the two arm of the sein and the five

but thi did not suit eustach
stop my cake said he rub both ear altern with
hi shoulder which in such case is the suprem sign of
discont
the three women retrac their step and on arriv in the
vicin of the tourroland oudard said to the other two
we must not all three gaze into the hole at onc for fear of
alarm the reclus do you two pretend to read the dominu in
the breviari while i thrust my nose into the apertur the
reclus know me a littl i will give you warn when you can
approach
she proceed alon to the window at the moment when she look
in a profound piti wa depict on all her featur and her
frank gai visag alter it express and color as abruptli as
though it had pass from a rai of sunlight to a rai of
moonlight her ey becam humid her mouth contract like that
of a person on the point of weep a moment later she laid her
finger on her lip and made a sign to mahiett to draw near and
look
mahiett much touch step up in silenc on tipto as
though approach the bedsid of a dy person
it wa in fact a melancholi spectacl which present itself to
the ey of the two women as thei gaze through the grate of
the rathol neither stir nor breath
the cell wa small broader than it wa long with an arch
ceil and view from within it bore a consider
resembl to the interior of a huge bishop mitr on the bare
flagston which form the floor in on corner a woman wa
sit or rather crouch her chin rest on her knee
which her cross arm press forcibl to her breast thu
doubl up clad in a brown sack which envelop her entir in
larg fold her long grai hair pull over in front fall
over her face and along her leg nearli to her feet she
present at the first glanc onli a strang form outlin
against the dark background of the cell a sort of duski
triangl which the rai of daylight fall through the open
cut roughli into two shade the on sombr the other
illumin it wa on of those spectr half light half
shadow such as on behold in dream and in the extraordinari
work of goya pale motionless sinist crouch over a tomb
or lean against the grate of a prison cell
it wa neither a woman nor a man nor a live be nor a
definit form it wa a figur a sort of vision in which the
real and the fantast intersect each other like dark and
dai it wa with difficulti that on distinguish beneath her
hair which spread to the ground a gaunt and sever profil her
dress bare allow the extrem of a bare foot to escap
which contract on the hard cold pavement the littl of human
form of which on caught a sight beneath thi envelop of
mourn caus a shudder
that figur which on might have suppos to be rivet to the
flagston appear to possess neither movement nor thought
nor breath ly in januari in that thin linen sack ly on
a granit floor without fire in the gloom of a cell whose
obliqu airhol allow onli the cold breez but never the sun
to enter from without she did not appear to suffer or even to
think on would have said that she had turn to stone with the
cell ic with the season her hand were clasp her ey
fix at first sight on took her for a spectr at the second
for a statu
nevertheless at interv her blue lip half open to admit a
breath and trembl but as dead and as mechan as the leav
which the wind sweep asid
nevertheless from her dull ey there escap a look an
ineff look a profound lugubri imperturb look
incessantli fix upon a corner of the cell which could not be
seen from without a gaze which seem to fix all the sombr
thought of that soul in distress upon some mysteri object
such wa the creatur who had receiv from her habit the
name of the reclus and from her garment the name of the
sack nun
the three women for gervais had rejoin mahiett and oudard
gaze through the window their head intercept the feebl
light in the cell without the wretch be whom thei thu
depriv of it seem to pai ani attent to them do not let
us troubl her said oudard in a low voic she is in her
ecstasi she is prai
meanwhil mahiett wa gaze with everincreas anxieti at
that wan wither dishevel head and her ey fill with
tear thi is veri singular she murmur
she thrust her head through the bar and succeed in cast a
glanc at the corner where the gaze of the unhappi woman wa
immov rivet
when she withdrew her head from the window her counten wa
inund with tear
what do you call that woman she ask oudard
oudard repli
we call her sister gudul
and i return mahiett call her paquett la chantefleuri
then lai her finger on her lip she motion to the
astound oudard to thrust her head through the window and look
oudard look and beheld in the corner where the ey of the
reclus were fix in that sombr ecstasi a tini shoe of pink
satin embroid with a thousand fanci design in gold and
silver
gervais look after oudard and then the three women gaze
upon the unhappi mother began to weep
but neither their look nor their tear disturb the reclus
her hand remain clasp her lip mute her ey fix and
that littl shoe thu gaze at broke the heart of ani on who
knew her histori
the three women had not yet utter a singl word thei dare not
speak even in a low voic thi deep silenc thi deep grief
thi profound oblivion in which everyth had disappear except
on thing produc upon them the effect of the grand altar at
christma or easter thei remain silent thei medit thei
were readi to kneel it seem to them that thei were readi to
enter a church on the dai of tenebr
at length gervais the most curiou of the three and
consequ the least sensit tri to make the reclus
speak
sister sister gudul
she repeat thi call three time rais her voic each time
the reclus did not move not a word not a glanc not a sigh
not a sign of life
oudard in her turn in a sweeter more caress
voicesist said she sister saintegudul
the same silenc the same immobl
a singular woman exclaim gervais and on not to be move
by a catapult
perchanc she is deaf said oudard
perhap she is blind ad gervais
dead perchanc return mahiett
it is certain that if the soul had not alreadi quit thi
inert sluggish letharg bodi it had at least retreat and
conceal itself in depth whither the percept of the
exterior organ no longer penetr
then we must leav the cake on the window said oudard some
scamp will take it what shall we do to rous her
eustach who up to that moment had been divert by a littl
carriag drawn by a larg dog which had just pass suddenli
perceiv that hi three conductress were gaze at someth

hi turn he climb upon a stone post elev himself on
tipto and appli hi fat red face to the open shout
mother let me see too
at the sound of thi clear fresh ring child voic the
reclus trembl she turn her head with the sharp abrupt
movement of a steel spring her long fleshless hand cast asid
the hair from her brow and she fix upon the child bitter
astonish desper ey thi glanc wa but a lightn
flash
oh my god she suddenli exclaim hide her head on her
knee and it seem as though her hoars voic tore her chest as

good dai madam said the child grave
nevertheless thi shock had so to speak awaken the reclus
a long shiver travers her frame from head to foot her teeth
chatter she half rais her head and said press her elbow
against her hip and clasp her feet in her hand as though to
warm them
oh how cold it is
poor woman said oudard with great compass would you

maiz which we have bake for you
she refus the cake which mahiett offer to her and said
black bread

chariti and unfasten her woolen cloak here is a cloak which
is a littl warmer than your
she refus the cloak as she had refus the flagon and the cake

but resum the good oudard you must have perceiv to some
extent that yesterdai wa a festiv

and as though fatigu with have said so much she drop her
head on her knee again the simpl and charit oudard who
fanci that she understood from her last word that she wa
complain of the cold repli innoc then you would like
a littl fire

everi limb wa trembl her voic quiver her ey flash
she had rais herself upon her knee suddenli she extend her
thin white hand toward the child who wa regard her with a
look of astonish take awai that child she cri the
egyptian woman is about to pass by
then she fell face downward on the earth and her forehead struck
the stone with the sound of on stone against anoth stone the
three women thought her dead a moment later howev she move
and thei beheld her drag herself on her knee and elbow to the
corner where the littl shoe wa then thei dare not look thei
no longer saw her but thei heard a thousand kiss and a
thousand sigh mingl with heartrend cri and dull blow
like those of a head in contact with a wall then after on of
these blow so violent that all three of them stagger thei
heard no more

her head through the airhol sister sister gudul
sister gudul repeat oudard
ah good heaven she no longer move resum gervais is

mahiett choke to such a point that she could not speak made
an effort wait said she then bend toward the window
paquett she said paquett le chantefleuri
a child who innoc blow upon the badli ignit fuse of a
bomb and make it explod in hi face is no more terrifi than
wa mahiett at the effect of that name abruptli launch into
the cell of sister gudul
the reclus trembl all over rose erect on her bare feet and
leap at the window with ey so glare that mahiett and
oudard and the other woman and the child recoil even to the
parapet of the quai
meanwhil the sinist face of the reclus appear press to
the grate of the airhol oh oh she cri with an
appal laugh ti the egyptian who is call me
at that moment a scene which wa pass at the pillori caught
her wild ey her brow contract with horror she stretch her
two skeleton arm from her cell and shriek in a voic which
resembl a deathrattl so ti thou onc more daughter of
egypt ti thou who callest me stealer of children well be

chapter iv a tear for a drop of water
these word were so to speak the point of union of two scene
which had up to that time been develop in parallel line at
the same moment each on it particular theatr on that which
the reader ha just perus in the rathol the other which he
is about to read on the ladder of the pillori the first had for
wit onli the three women with whom the reader ha just made
acquaint the second had for spectat all the public which
we have seen abov collect on the place de grve around the
pillori and the gibbet
that crowd which the four sergeant post at nine oclock in the
morn at the four corner of the pillori had inspir with the
hope of some sort of an execut no doubt not a hang but a
whip a crop of ear someth in shortthat crowd had
increas so rapidli that the four policemen too close
besieg had had occas to press it as the express then
ran more than onc by sound blow of their whip and the
haunch of their hors
thi populac disciplin to wait for public execut did
not manifest veri much impati it amus itself with watch
the pillori a veri simpl sort of monument compos of a cube
of masonri about six feet high and hollow in the interior a veri
steep staircas of unhewn stone which wa call by distinct

horizont wheel of solid oak the victim wa bound upon thi
wheel on hi knee with hi hand behind hi back a wooden
shaft which set in motion a capstan conceal in the interior of
the littl edific impart a rotatori motion to the wheel
which alwai maintain it horizont posit and in thi
manner present the face of the condemn man to all quarter of
the squar in success thi wa what wa call turn a
crimin
as the reader perceiv the pillori of the grve wa far from
present all the recreat of the pillori of the hall
noth architectur noth monument no roof to the iron
cross no octagon lantern no frail slender column spread
out on the edg of the roof into capit of acanthu leav and
flower no waterspout of chimera and monster on carv
woodwork no fine sculptur deepli sunk in the stone
thei were forc to content themselv with those four stretch
of rubbl work back with sandston and a wretch stone
gibbet meagr and bare on on side
the entertain would have been but a poor on for lover of
gothic architectur it is true that noth wa ever less
curiou on the score of architectur than the worthi gaper of
the middl ag and that thei care veri littl for the beauti
of a pillori
the victim final arriv bound to the tail of a cart and when
he had been hoist upon the platform where he could be seen
from all point of the place bound with cord and strap upon
the wheel of the pillori a prodigi hoot mingl with
laughter and acclam burst forth upon the place thei had
recogn quasimodo
it wa he in fact the chang wa singular pillori on the
veri place where on the dai befor he had been salut
acclaim and proclaim pope and princ of fool in the
cortg of the duke of egypt the king of thune and the emperor
of galile on thing is certain and that is that there wa not
a soul in the crowd not even himself though in turn triumphant
and the suffer who set forth thi combin clearli in hi
thought gringoir and hi philosophi were miss at thi
spectacl
soon michel noiret sworn trumpet to the king our lord
impos silenc on the lout and proclaim the sentenc in
accord with the order and command of monsieur the provost
then he withdrew behind the cart with hi men in liveri
surcoat
quasimodo impass did not winc all resist had been
render imposs to him by what wa then call in the style
of the crimin chancelleri the vehem and firm of the
bond which mean that the thong and chain probabl cut into
hi flesh moreov it is a tradit of jail and warden which
ha not been lost and which the handcuff still precious
preserv among us a civil gentl human peopl the
gallei and the guillotin in parenthes
he had allow himself to be led push carri lift bound
and bound again noth wa to be seen upon hi counten but
the astonish of a savag or an idiot he wa known to be
deaf on might have pronounc him to be blind
thei place him on hi knee on the circular plank he made no
resist thei remov hi shirt and doublet as far as hi
girdl he allow them to have their wai thei entangl him
under a fresh system of thong and buckl he allow them to
bind and buckl him onli from time to time he snort noisili
like a calf whose head is hang and bump over the edg of a
butcher cart
the dolt said jehan frollo of the mill to hi friend robin
poussepain for the two student had follow the culprit as wa
to have been expect he understand no more than a cockchaf
shut up in a box
there wa wild laughter among the crowd when thei beheld
quasimodo hump hi camel breast hi callou and hairi
shoulder laid bare dure thi gayeti a man in the liveri of
the citi short of statur and robust of mien mount the
platform and place himself near the victim hi name speedili
circul among the spectat it wa master pierrat torteru
offici tortur to the chtelet
he began by deposit on an angl of the pillori a black
hourglass the upper lobe of which wa fill with red sand
which it allow to glide into the lower receptacl then he
remov hi particolor surtout and there becam visibl
suspend from hi right hand a thin and taper whip of long
white shine knot plait thong arm with metal nail
with hi left hand he neglig fold back hi shirt around
hi right arm to the veri armpit
in the meantim jehan frollo elev hi curli blond head
abov the crowd he had mount upon the shoulder of robin
poussepain for the purpos shout come and look gentl
ladi and men thei ar go to peremptorili flagel master
quasimodo the bellring of my brother monsieur the archdeacon
of josa a knave of orient architectur who ha a back like a
dome and leg like twist column
and the crowd burst into a laugh especi the boi and young
girl
at length the tortur stamp hi foot the wheel began to turn
quasimodo waver beneath hi bond the amaz which wa
suddenli depict upon hi deform face caus the burst of
laughter to redoubl around him
all at onc at the moment when the wheel in it revolut
present to master pierrat the hump back of quasimodo master
pierrat rais hi arm the fine thong whistl sharpli through
the air like a hand of adder and fell with furi upon the
wretch shoulder
quasimodo leap as though awaken with a start he began to
understand he writh in hi bond a violent contract of
surpris and pain distort the muscl of hi face but he
utter not a singl sigh he mere turn hi head backward to
the right then to the left balanc it as a bull doe who ha
been stung in the flank by a gadfli
a second blow follow the first then a third and anoth and
anoth and still other the wheel did not ceas to turn nor
the blow to rain down
soon the blood burst forth and could be seen trickl in a
thousand thread down the hunchback black shoulder and the
slender thong in their rotatori motion which rent the air
sprinkl drop of it upon the crowd
quasimodo had resum to all appear hi first
imperturb he had at first tri in a quiet wai and
without much outward movement to break hi bond hi ey had
been seen to light up hi muscl to stiffen hi member to
concentr their forc and the strap to stretch the effort
wa power prodigi desper but the provost season
bond resist thei crack and that wa all quasimodo fell
back exhaust amaz gave wai on hi featur to a
sentiment of profound and bitter discourag he close hi
singl ey allow hi head to droop upon hi breast and
feign death
from that moment forth he stir no more noth could forc a
movement from him neither hi blood which did not ceas to
flow nor the blow which redoubl in furi nor the wrath of the
tortur who grew excit himself and intox with the
execut nor the sound of the horribl thong more sharp and
whistl than the claw of scorpion
at length a bailiff from the chtelet clad in black mount on a
black hors who had been station besid the ladder sinc the
begin of the execut extend hi eboni wand toward the
hourglass the tortur stop the wheel stop quasimodo
ey open slowli
the scourg wa finish two lackei of the offici tortur
bath the bleed shoulder of the patient anoint them with
some unguent which immedi close all the wound and threw
upon hi back a sort of yellow vestment in cut like a chasubl
in the meanwhil pierrat torteru allow the thong red and
gorg with blood to drip upon the pavement
all wa not over for quasimodo he had still to undergo that hour
of pillori which master florian barbedienn had so judici
ad to the sentenc of messir robert destoutevil all to
the greater glori of the old physiolog and psycholog plai
upon word of jean de cumn surdu absurdu a deaf man is
absurd
so the hourglass wa turn over onc more and thei left the
hunchback fasten to the plank in order that justic might be
accomplish to the veri end
the populac especi in the middl ag is in societi what
the child is in the famili as long as it remain in it state of
primit ignor of moral and intellectu minor it can
be said of it as of the child
ti the pitiless ag
we have alreadi shown that quasimodo wa gener hate for
more than on good reason it is true there wa hardli a
spectat in that crowd who had not or who did not believ that
he had reason to complain of the malevol hunchback of
notredam the joi at see him appear thu in the pillori had
been univers and the harsh punish which he had just
suffer and the piti condit in which it had left him far
from soften the populac had render it hatr more
malici by arm it with a touch of mirth
henc the public prosecut satisfi as the bigwig of the
law still express it in their jargon the turn came of a thousand
privat vengeanc here as in the grand hall the women
render themselv particularli promin all cherish some
rancor against him some for hi malic other for hi ugli
the latter were the most furiou
oh mask of antichrist said on
rider on a broom handl cri anoth
what a fine tragic grimac howl a third and who would make
him pope of the fool if todai were yesterdai
ti well struck in an old woman thi is the grimac of the
pillori when shall we have that of the gibbet
when will you be coif with your big bell a hundr feet under
ground curs bellring
but ti the devil who ring the angelu
oh the deaf man the oneei creatur the hunchback the
monster
a face to make a woman miscarri better than all the drug and
medicin
and the two scholar jehan du moulin and robin poussepain sang
at the top of their lung the ancient refrain
un hart
pour le pendard
un fagot
pour le magot33
a thousand other insult rain down upon him and hoot and
imprec and laughter and now and then stone
quasimodo wa deaf but hi sight wa clear and the public furi
wa no less energet depict on their visag than in their
word moreov the blow from the stone explain the burst
of laughter
at first he held hi ground but littl by littl that patienc
which had born up under the lash of the tortur yield and
gave wai befor all these sting of insect the bull of the
asturia who ha been but littl move by the attack of the
picador grow irrit with the dog and banderillera
he first cast around a slow glanc of hatr upon the crowd but
bound as he wa hi glanc wa powerless to drive awai those
fli which were sting hi wound then he move in hi bond
and hi furiou exert made the ancient wheel of the pillori
shriek on it axl all thi onli increas the deris and
hoot
then the wretch man unabl to break hi collar like that of a
chain wild beast becam tranquil onc more onli at interv
a sigh of rage heav the hollow of hi chest there wa neither
shame nor red on hi face he wa too far from the state of
societi and too near the state of natur to know what shame wa
moreov with such a degre of deform is infami a thing that
can be felt but wrath hatr despair slowli lower over that
hideou visag a cloud which grew ever more and more sombr ever
more and more charg with electr which burst forth in a
thousand lightn flash from the ey of the cyclop
nevertheless that cloud clear awai for a moment at the
passag of a mule which travers the crowd bear a priest as
far awai as he could see that mule and that priest the poor
victim visag grew gentler the furi which had contract it
wa follow by a strang smile full of ineff sweet
gentl and tender in proport as the priest
approach that smile becam more clear more distinct more
radiant it wa like the arriv of a saviour which the unhappi
man wa greet but as soon as the mule wa near enough to the
pillori to allow of it rider recogn the victim the priest
drop hi ey beat a hasti retreat spur on rigor as
though in hast to rid himself of humili appeal and not at
all desir of be salut and recogn by a poor fellow in
such a predica
thi priest wa archdeacon dom claud frollo
the cloud descend more blackli than ever upon quasimodo brow
the smile wa still mingl with it for a time but wa bitter
discourag profoundli sad
time pass on he had been there at least an hour and a half
lacer maltreat mock incessantli and almost stone
all at onc he move again in hi chain with redoubl despair
which made the whole framework that bore him trembl and
break the silenc which he had obstin preserv hitherto
he cri in a hoars and furiou voic which resembl a bark
rather than a human cry and which wa drown in the nois of
the hootsdrink
thi exclam of distress far from excit compass onli
ad amus to the good parisian populac who surround the
ladder and who it must be confess taken in the mass and as a
multitud wa then no less cruel and brutal than that horribl
tribe of robber among whom we have alreadi conduct the reader
and which wa simpli the lower stratum of the populac not a
voic wa rais around the unhappi victim except to jeer at hi
thirst it is certain that at that moment he wa more grotesqu
and repuls than pitiabl with hi face purpl and drip
hi ey wild hi mouth foam with rage and pain and hi
tongu loll half out it must also be state that if a
charit soul of a bourgeoi or bourgeois in the rabbl
had attempt to carri a glass of water to that wretch creatur
in torment there reign around the infam step of the
pillori such a prejudic of shame and ignomini that it would
have suffic to repuls the good samaritan
at the expir of a few moment quasimodo cast a desper
glanc upon the crowd and repeat in a voic still more
heartrend drink
and all began to laugh
drink thi cri robin poussepain throw in hi face a
spong which had been soak in the gutter there you deaf
villain im your debtor
a woman hurl a stone at hi head
that will teach you to wake us up at night with your peal of a
dam soul
he good my son howl a crippl make an effort to reach
him with hi crutch will you cast ani more spell on us from
the top of the tower of notredam
here a drink cup chime in a man fling a broken jug
at hi breast twa you that made my wife simpli becaus she
pass near you give birth to a child with two head
and my cat bring forth a kitten with six paw yelp an old
crone launch a brick at him
drink repeat quasimodo pant and for the third time
at that moment he beheld the crowd give wai a young girl
fantast dress emerg from the throng she wa
accompani by a littl white goat with gild horn and carri
a tambourin in her hand
quasimodo ey sparkl it wa the gypsi whom he had attempt
to carri off on the preced night a misde for which he wa
dimli consciou that he wa be punish at that veri moment
which wa not in the least the case sinc he wa be chastis
onli for the misfortun of be deaf and of have been judg
by a deaf man he doubt not that she had come to wreak her
vengeanc also and to deal her blow like the rest
he beheld her in fact mount the ladder rapidli wrath and spite
suffoc him he would have like to make the pillori crumbl
into ruin and if the lightn of hi ey could have dealt
death the gypsi would have been reduc to powder befor she
reach the platform
she approach without utter a syllabl the victim who
writh in a vain effort to escap her and detach a gourd
from her girdl she rais it gentli to the parch lip of the
miser man
then from that ey which had been up to that moment so dry and
burn a big tear wa seen to fall and roll slowli down that
deform visag so long contract with despair it wa the
first in all probabl that the unfortun man had ever
shed
meanwhil he had forgotten to drink the gypsi made her littl
pout from impati and press the spout to the tusk month
of quasimodo with a smile
he drank with deep draught hi thirst wa burn
when he had finish the wretch protrud hi black lip no
doubt with the object of kiss the beauti hand which had
just succour him but the young girl who wa perhap
somewhat distrust and who rememb the violent attempt of
the night withdrew her hand with the frighten gestur of a
child who is afraid of be bitten by a beast
then the poor deaf man fix on her a look full of reproach and
inexpress sad
it would have been a touch spectacl anywherethi beauti
fresh pure and charm girl who wa at the same time so weak
thu hasten to the relief of so much miseri deform and
malevol on the pillori the spectacl wa sublim
the veri populac were captiv by it and began to clap their
hand cry
nol nol

of her finger and toss it into the air as she danc
proven saraband agil light joyou and unconsci of the
formid gaze which descend perpendicularli upon her head
the crowd wa swarm around her from time to time a man
accoutr in red and yellow made them form into a circl and
then return seat himself on a chair a few pace from the
dancer and took the goat head on hi knee thi man seem to
be the gypsi companion claud frollo could not distinguish hi
featur from hi elev post
from the moment when the archdeacon caught sight of thi
stranger hi attent seem divid between him and the
dancer and hi face becam more and more gloomi all at onc he
rose upright and a quiver ran through hi whole bodi who is
that man he mutter between hi teeth i have alwai seen her
alon befor
then he plung down beneath the tortuou vault of the spiral
staircas and onc more descend as he pass the door of the
bell chamber which wa ajar he saw someth which struck him
he beheld quasimodo who lean through an open of on of
those slate penthous which resembl enorm blind appear
also to be gaze at the place he wa engag in so profound a
contempl that he did not notic the passag of hi adopt
father hi savag ey had a singular express it wa a
charm tender look thi is strang murmur claud is it
the gypsi at whom he is thu gaze he continu hi descent
at the end of a few minut the anxiou archdeacon enter upon
the place from the door at the base of the tower
what ha becom of the gypsi girl he said mingl with the
group of spectat which the sound of the tambourin had
collect
i know not repli on of hi neighbor i think that she ha
gone to make some of her fandango in the hous opposit
whither thei have call her
in the place of the gypsi on the carpet whose arabesqu had
seem to vanish but a moment previous by the caprici
figur of her danc the archdeacon no longer beheld ani on but
the red and yellow man who in order to earn a few tester in
hi turn wa walk round the circl with hi elbow on hi
hip hi head thrown back hi face red hi neck outstretch
with a chair between hi teeth to the chair he had fasten a
cat which a neighbor had lent and which wa spit in great
affright
notredam exclaim the archdeacon at the moment when the
juggler perspir heavili pass in front of him with hi
pyramid of chair and hi cat what is master pierr gringoir
do here
the harsh voic of the archdeacon threw the poor fellow into such
a commot that he lost hi equilibrium togeth with hi whole
edific and the chair and the cat tumbl pellmel upon the
head of the spectat in the midst of inextinguish
hoot
it is probabl that master pierr gringoir for it wa inde
he would have had a sorri account to settl with the neighbor
who own the cat and all the bruis and scratch face which
surround him if he had not hasten to profit by the tumult to
take refug in the church whither claud frollo had made him a
sign to follow him
the cathedr wa alreadi dark and desert the sideaisl were
full of shadow and the lamp of the chapel began to shine out
like star so black had the vault ceil becom onli the
great rose window of the faad whose thousand color were
steep in a rai of horizont sunlight glitter in the gloom
like a mass of diamond and threw it dazzl reflect to the
other end of the nave
when thei had advanc a few pace dom claud place hi back
against a pillar and gaze intent at gringoir the gaze wa
not the on which gringoir fear asham as he wa of have
been caught by a grave and learn person in the costum of a
buffoon there wa noth mock or iron in the priest

master it is not suffici to pass on life on must earn
the mean for life
dom claud listen in silenc all at onc hi deepset ey
assum so sagaci and penetr an express that
gringoir felt himself so to speak search to the bottom of
the soul by that glanc
veri good master pierr but how come it that you ar now in
compani with that gypsi dancer
in faith said gringoir ti becaus she is my wife and i am
her husband
the priest gloomi ey flash into flame
have you done that you wretch he cri seiz gringoir
arm with furi have you been so abandon by god as to rais
your hand against that girl
on my chanc of paradis monseigneur repli gringoir
trembl in everi limb i swear to you that i have never
touch her if that is what disturb you
then why do you talk of husband and wife said the priest
gringoir made hast to relat to him as succinctli as possibl
all that the reader alreadi know hi adventur in the court of
miracl and the brokencrock marriag it appear moreov
that thi marriag had led to no result whatev and that each
even the gypsi girl cheat him of hi nuptial right as on the
first dai ti a mortif he said in conclus but
that is becaus i have had the misfortun to wed a virgin
what do you mean demand the archdeacon who had been
gradual appeas by thi recit
ti veri difficult to explain repli the poet it is a
superstit my wife is accord to what an old thief who is
call among us the duke of egypt ha told me a foundl or a
lost child which is the same thing she wear on her neck an
amulet which it is affirm will caus her to meet her parent
some dai but which will lose it virtu if the young girl lose
her henc it follow that both of us remain veri virtuou
so resum claud whose brow clear more and more you
believ master pierr that thi creatur ha not been
approach by ani man
what would you have a man do dom claud as against a
superstit she ha got that in her head i assuredli esteem as
a rariti thi nunlik pruderi which is preserv untam amid
those bohemian girl who ar so easili brought into subject
but she ha three thing to protect her the duke of egypt who
ha taken her under hi safeguard reckon perchanc on
sell her to some gai abb all hi tribe who hold her in
singular vener like a notredam and a certain tini
poignard which the buxom dame alwai wear about her in some
nook in spite of the ordin of the provost and which on
caus to fly out into her hand by squeez her waist ti a
proud wasp i can tell you
the archdeacon press gringoir with question
la esmeralda in the judgment of gringoir wa an inoffens
and charm creatur pretti with the except of a pout which
wa peculiar to her a nave and passion damsel ignor of
everyth and enthusiast about everyth not yet awar of
the differ between a man and a woman even in her dream
made like that wild especi over danc nois the open
air a sort of woman bee with invis wing on her feet and
live in a whirlwind she ow thi natur to the wander life
which she had alwai led gringoir had succeed in learn
that while a mere child she had travers spain and catalonia
even to sicili he believ that she had even been taken by the
caravan of zingari of which she form a part to the kingdom of
algier a countri situat in achaia which countri adjoin on
on side albania and greec on the other the sicilian sea
which is the road to constantinopl the bohemian said
gringoir were vassal of the king of algier in hi qualiti of
chief of the white moor on thing is certain that la esmeralda
had come to franc while still veri young by wai of hungari
from all these countri the young girl had brought back
fragment of queer jargon song and strang idea which made
her languag as motlei as her costum half parisian half
african howev the peopl of the quarter which she frequent
love her for her gayeti her dainti her live manner her
danc and her song she believ herself to be hate in all
the citi by but two person of whom she often spoke in terror
the sack nun of the tourroland a villan reclus who
cherish some secret grudg against these gypsi and who
curs the poor dancer everi time that the latter pass befor
her window and a priest who never met her without cast at
her look and word which frighten her
the mention of thi last circumst disturb the archdeacon
greatli though gringoir paid no attent to hi perturb
to such an extent had two month suffic to caus the heedless
poet to forget the singular detail of the even on which he
had met the gypsi and the presenc of the archdeacon in it all
otherwis the littl dancer fear noth she did not tell
fortun which protect her against those trial for magic
which were so frequent institut against gypsi women and
then gringoir held the posit of her brother if not of her
husband after all the philosoph endur thi sort of platon
marriag veri patient it meant a shelter and bread at least
everi morn he set out from the lair of the thiev gener
with the gypsi he help her make her collect of targes34
and littl blanks35 in the squar each even he return to
the same roof with her allow her to bolt herself into her
littl chamber and slept the sleep of the just a veri sweet
exist take it all in all he said and well adapt to
reveri and then on hi soul and conscienc the philosoph wa
not veri sure that he wa madli in love with the gypsi he love
her goat almost as dearli it wa a charm anim gentl
intellig clever a learn goat noth wa more common in
the middl ag than these learn anim which amaz peopl
greatli and often led their instructor to the stake but the
witchcraft of the goat with the golden hoof wa a veri innoc
speci of magic gringoir explain them to the archdeacon
whom these detail seem to interest deepli in the major of
case it wa suffici to present the tambourin to the goat in
such or such a manner in order to obtain from him the trick
desir he had been train to thi by the gypsi who possess
in these delic art so rare a talent that two month had
suffic to teach the goat to write with movabl letter the
word phbu
phbu said the priest why phbu
i know not repli gringoir perhap it is a word which she
believ to be endow with some magic and secret virtu she
often repeat it in a low tone when she think that she is
alon
ar you sure persist claud with hi penetr glanc
that it is onli a word and not a name
the name of whom said the poet
how should i know said the priest
thi is what i imagin messir these bohemian ar someth
like guebr and ador the sun henc phbu
that doe not seem so clear to me as to you master pierr
after all that doe not concern me let her mumbl her phbu
at her pleasur on thing is certain that djali love me almost
as much as he doe her
who is djali
the goat
the archdeacon drop hi chin into hi hand and appear to
reflect for a moment all at onc he turn abruptli to gringoir
onc more
and do you swear to me that you have not touch her
whom said gringoir the goat
no that woman
my wife i swear to you that i have not

oh oh solu cum sola non cogitabuntur orar pater noster
upon my soul i could sai the pater and the av maria and
the credo in deum patrem omnipotentem without her pai ani
more attent to me than a chicken to a church
swear to me by the bodi of your mother repeat the
archdeacon violent that you have not touch that creatur
with even the tip of your finger
i will also swear it by the head of my father for the two
thing have more affin between them but my reverend master
permit me a question in my turn
speak sir
what concern is it of your
the archdeacon pale face becam as crimson as the cheek of a
young girl he remain for a moment without answer then
with visibl embarrass
listen master pierr gringoir you ar not yet damn so far
as i know i take an interest in you and wish you well now the
least contact with that egyptian of the demon would make you the
vassal of satan you know that ti alwai the bodi which ruin
the soul woe to you if you approach that woman that is all
i tri onc said gringoir scratch hi ear it wa the
first dai but i got stung
you were so audaci master pierr and the priest brow
cloud over again
on anoth occas continu the poet with a smile i
peep through the keyhol befor go to bed and i beheld the
most delici dame in her shift that ever made a bed creak under
her bare foot
go to the devil cri the priest with a terribl look and
give the amaz gringoir a push on the shoulder he plung
with long stride under the gloomiest arcad of the cathedr

noth more of the doubl nois which constitut a church the
organ within the bell without the organ alon remain on
would have said that there wa no longer a musician in the
belfri quasimodo wa alwai there nevertheless what then had
happen to him wa it that the shame and despair of the pillori
still linger in the bottom of hi heart that the lash of hi
tormentor whip reverber unendingli in hi soul and that
the sad of such treatment had wholli extinguish in him even
hi passion for the bell or wa it that mari had a rival in
the heart of the bellring of notredam and that the great
bell and her fourteen sister were neglect for someth more
amiabl and more beauti
it chanc that in the year of grace 1482 annunci dai fell

on arriv in the lofti bell chamber quasimodo gaze for some
time at the six bell and shook hi head sadli as though

he dress himself sadli an idea had occur to him as he lace

then he hastili don hi long jacket with fur halfsleev

exclam verament quest rotisseri sono cosa
stupenda36 but jehan had not the wherewith to bui a

massiv tower which guard the entranc to the citi
he did not even take the troubl to cast a stone in pass as

he cook the philosoph stone there over a hot fire bdieu
i care no more for the philosoph stone than for a pebbl and
i would rather find over hi furnac an omelett of easter egg
and bacon than the biggest philosoph stone in the world
on arriv at the galleri of slender column he took breath for
a moment and swore against the intermin staircas by i know
not how mani million cartload of devil then he resum hi
ascent through the narrow door of the north tower now close to
the public sever moment after pass the bell chamber he
came upon a littl landingplac built in a later nich and

in fact there wa no fire in the furnac and it seem as

bent over a vast manuscript ornament with fantast

courthous over her head poor fly who could not have lift
even on of it block of stone
assuredli provid and societi had been equal unjust such
an excess of unhappi and of tortur wa not necessari to
break so frail a creatur
there she lai lost in the shadow buri hidden immur ani
on who could have beheld her in thi state after have seen
her laugh and danc in the sun would have shudder cold as
night cold as death not a breath of air in her tress not a
human sound in her ear no longer a rai of light in her ey
snap in twain crush with chain crouch besid a jug and
a loaf on a littl straw in a pool of water which wa form
under her by the sweat of the prison wall without motion
almost without breath she had no longer the power to suffer
phbu the sun middai the open air the street of pari the
danc with applaus the sweet babbl of love with the
offic then the priest the old crone the poignard the blood
the tortur the gibbet all thi did inde pass befor her
mind sometim as a charm and golden vision sometim as a
hideou nightmar but it wa no longer anyth but a vagu and
horribl struggl lost in the gloom or distant music plai up
abov ground and which wa no longer audibl at the depth where
the unhappi girl had fallen
sinc she had been there she had neither wake nor slept in
that misfortun in that cell she could no longer distinguish
her wake hour from slumber dream from realiti ani more than
dai from night all thi wa mix broken float
dissemin confusedli in her thought she no longer felt she
no longer knew she no longer thought at the most she onli
dream never had a live creatur been thrust more deepli into
nothing
thu benumb frozen petrifi she had bare notic on two
or three occas the sound of a trapdoor open somewher
abov her without even permit the passag of a littl light
and through which a hand had toss her a bit of black bread
nevertheless thi period visit of the jailer wa the sole
commun which wa left her with mankind
a singl thing still mechan occupi her ear abov her
head the damp wa filter through the mouldi stone of the
vault and a drop of water drop from them at regular
interv she listen stupidli to the nois made by thi drop
of water as it fell into the pool besid her
thi drop of water fall from time to time into that pool wa
the onli movement which still went on around her the onli clock
which mark the time the onli nois which reach her of all
the nois made on the surfac of the earth
to tell the whole howev she also felt from time to time in
that cesspool of mire and dark someth cold pass over
her foot or her arm and she shudder
how long had she been there she did not know she had a
recollect of a sentenc of death pronounc somewher against
some on then of have been herself carri awai and of wake
up in dark and silenc chill to the heart she had drag
herself along on her hand then iron ring that cut her ankl
and chain had rattl she had recogn the fact that all
around her wa wall that below her there wa a pavement cover
with moistur and a truss of straw but neither lamp nor
airhol then she had seat herself on that straw and
sometim for the sake of chang her attitud on the last
stone step in her dungeon for a while she had tri to count the
black minut measur off for her by the drop of water but that
melancholi labor of an ail brain had broken off of itself in
her head and had left her in stupor
at length on dai or on night for midnight and middai were
of the same color in that sepulchr she heard abov her a
louder nois than wa usual made by the turnkei when he brought
her bread and jug of water she rais her head and beheld a rai
of reddish light pass through the crevic in the sort of
trapdoor contriv in the roof of the inpac
at the same time the heavi lock creak the trap grate on it
rusti hing turn and she beheld a lantern a hand and the
lower portion of the bodi of two men the door be too low
to admit of her see their head the light pain her so
acut that she shut her ey
when she open them again the door wa close the lantern wa
deposit on on of the step of the staircas a man alon stood
befor her a monk black cloak fell to hi feet a cowl of the
same color conceal hi face noth wa visibl of hi person
neither face nor hand it wa a long black shroud stand
erect and beneath which someth could be felt move she
gaze fixedli for sever minut at thi sort of spectr but
neither he nor she spoke on would have pronounc them two
statu confront each other two thing onli seem aliv in
that cavern the wick of the lantern which sputter on account
of the damp of the atmospher and the drop of water from the
roof which cut thi irregular sputter with it monoton
splash and made the light of the lantern quiver in concentr
wave on the oili water of the pool
at last the prison broke the silenc

chapter vi three human heart differ construct
phbu wa not dead howev men of that stamp die hard when
master philipp lheulier advoc extraordinari of the king had
said to poor esmeralda he is dy it wa an error or a jest
when the archdeacon had repeat to the condemn girl he is
dead the fact is that he knew noth about it but that he
believ it that he count on it that he did not doubt it
that he devoutli hope it it would have been too hard for him to
give favor new of hi rival to the woman whom he love ani
man would have done the same in hi place
it wa not that phbuss wound had not been seriou but it had
not been as much so as the archdeacon believ the physician to
whom the soldier of the watch had carri him at the first
moment had fear for hi life dure the space of a week and
had even told him so in latin but youth had gain the upper
hand and as frequent happen in spite of prognost
and diagnos natur had amus herself by save the sick man
under the physician veri nose it wa while he wa still ly
on the leech pallet that he had submit to the interrog
of philipp lheulier and the offici inquisitor which had
annoi him greatli henc on fine morn feel himself
better he had left hi golden spur with the leech as payment

after all it did not pleas him in the least to appear in thi
suit he had a vagu feel that he should plai a ridicul
figur in it on the whole he did not know what to think of the
whole affair superstiti and not given to devout like
everi soldier who is onli a soldier when he came to question
himself about thi adventur he did not feel assur as to the
goat as to the singular fashion in which he had met la
esmeralda as to the no less strang manner in which she had
allow him to divin her love as to her charact as a gypsi
and lastli as to the surli monk he perceiv in all these
incid much more magic than love probabl a sorceress
perhap the devil a comedi in short or to speak in the

moreov he hope that the affair would not get nois abroad
that hi name would hardli be pronounc in it and that in ani
case it would not go beyond the court of the tournel in thi
he wa not mistaken there wa then no gazett de tribunaux
and as not a week pass which had not it counterfeit to boil

at that moment middai rang slowli out from the clock of
notredam a murmur of satisfact broke out in the crowd the
last vibrat of the twelfth stroke had hardli di awai when
all head surg like the wave beneath a squall and an immens
shout went up from the pavement the window and the roof
there she is
fleurd press her hand to her ey that she might not
see
charm girl said phbu do you wish to withdraw
no she repli and she open through curios the ey
which she had close through fear
a tumbrel drawn by a stout norman hors and all surround by
cavalri in violet liveri with white cross had just debouch
upon the place through the rue saintpierreauxbuf the
sergeant of the watch were clear a passag for it through the
crowd by stout blow from their club besid the cart rode
sever offic of justic and polic recogniz by their
black costum and their awkward in the saddl master jacqu
charmolu parad at their head
in the fatal cart sat a young girl with her arm ti behind her
back and with no priest besid her she wa in her shift her
long black hair the fashion then wa to cut it off onli at the
foot of the gallow fell in disord upon her halfbar throat
and shoulder
athwart that wave hair more glossi than the plumag of a
raven a thick rough grai rope wa visibl twist and
knot chafe her delic collarbon and twine round the
charm neck of the poor girl like an earthworm round a flower
beneath that rope glitter a tini amulet ornament with bit of
green glass which had been left to her no doubt becaus noth
is refus to those who ar about to die the spectat in the
window could see in the bottom of the cart her nake leg which
she strove to hide beneath her as by a final feminin instinct
at her feet lai a littl goat bound the condemn girl held
togeth with her teeth her imperfectli fasten shift on would
have said that she suffer still more in her miseri from be
thu expos almost nake to the ey of all ala modesti is
not made for such shock
jesu said fleurd hastili to the captain look fair

so sai she turn to phbu hi ey were fix on the
tumbrel he wa veri pale
what bohemian with the goat he stammer
what resum fleurd do you not rememb
phbu interrupt her
i do not know what you mean
he made a step to reenter the room but fleurd whose
jealousi previous so vividli arous by thi same gypsi had
just been reawaken fleurd gave him a look full of
penetr and distrust she vagu recal at that moment
have heard of a captain mix up in the trial of that witch
what is the matter with you she said to phbu on would
sai that thi woman had disturb you
phbu forc a sneer
me not the least in the world ah ye certainli
remain then she continu imperi and let us see the
end
the unlucki captain wa oblig to remain he wa somewhat
reassur by the fact that the condemn girl never remov her
ey from the bottom of the cart it wa but too sure la
esmeralda in thi last stage of opprobrium and misfortun she
wa still beauti her great black ey appear still larger
becaus of the emaci of her cheek her pale profil wa
pure and sublim she resembl what she had been in the same
degre that a virgin by masaccio resembl a virgin of
raphaelweak thinner more delic
moreov there wa noth in her which wa not shaken in some
sort and which with the except of her modesti she did not
let go at will so profoundli had she been broken by stupor and
despair her bodi bound at everi jolt of the tumbrel like a
dead or broken thing her gaze wa dull and imbecil a tear wa
still visibl in her ey but motionless and frozen so to
speak
meanwhil the lugubri cavalcad ha travers the crowd amid
cri of joi and curiou attitud but as a faith historian
we must state that on behold her so beauti so depress
mani were move with piti even among the hardest of them
the tumbrel had enter the parvi
it halt befor the central portal the escort rang themselv
in line on both side the crowd becam silent and in the midst
of thi silenc full of anxieti and solemn the two leav of
the grand door swung back as of themselv on their hing
which gave a creak like the sound of a fife then there becam
visibl in all it length the deep gloomi church hung in
black spare light with a few candl gleam afar off on
the princip altar open in the midst of the place which wa
dazzl with light like the mouth of a cavern at the veri
extrem in the gloom of the aps a gigant silver cross wa
visibl against a black draperi which hung from the vault to the
pavement the whole nave wa desert but a few head of priest
could be seen move confusedli in the distant choir stall and
at the moment when the great door open there escap from the
church a loud solemn and monoton chant which cast over
the head of the condemn girl in gust fragment of melancholi
psalm
non timebo millia populi circumdanti me exsurg domin
salvum me fac deu
salvum me fac deu quoniam intraverunt aqu usqu ad animam
meam
infixu sum in limo profundi et non est substantia
at the same time anoth voic separ from the choir inton
upon the step of the chief altar thi melancholi offertori
qui verbum meum audit et credit ei qui misit me habet vitam
ternam et in judicium non venit sed transit a mort in
vitam46
thi chant which a few old men buri in the gloom sang from
afar over that beauti creatur full of youth and life
caress by the warm air of spring inund with sunlight wa
the mass for the dead
the peopl listen devoutli
the unhappi girl seem to lose her sight and her conscious
in the obscur interior of the church her white lip move as
though in prayer and the headsman assist who approach to
assist her to alight from the cart heard her repeat thi word
in a low tonephbu
thei unti her hand made her alight accompani by her goat
which had also been unbound and which bleat with joi at
find itself free and thei made her walk barefoot on the hard
pavement to the foot of the step lead to the door the rope
about her neck trail behind her on would have said it wa a
serpent follow her
then the chant in the church ceas a great golden cross and
a row of wax candl began to move through the gloom the
halberd of the motlei beadl clank and a few moment later
a long process of priest in chasubl and deacon in
dalmat march grave toward the condemn girl as thei
drawl their song spread out befor her view and that of the
crowd but her glanc rest on the on who march at the head
immedi after the crossbear
oh she said in a low voic and with a shudder ti he
again the priest
it wa in fact the archdeacon on hi left he had the
subchant on hi right the chanter arm with hi offici
wand he advanc with head thrown back hi ey fix and wide
open inton in a strong voic
de ventr inferi clamavi et exaudisti vocem meam
et projecisti me in profundum in cord mari et flumem
circumdedit me47
at the moment when he made hi appear in the full daylight
beneath the lofti arch portal envelop in an ampl cope of
silver bar with a black cross he wa so pale that more than
on person in the crowd thought that on of the marbl bishop
who knelt on the sepulchr stone of the choir had risen and wa
come to receiv upon the brink of the tomb the woman who wa
about to die
she no less pale no less like a statu had hardli notic that
thei had place in her hand a heavi light candl of yellow
wax she had not heard the yelp voic of the clerk read the
fatal content of the apolog when thei told her to respond with
amen she respond amen she onli recov life and forc
when she beheld the priest make a sign to her guard to withdraw
and himself advanc alon toward her
then she felt her blood boil in her head and a remnant of
indign flash up in that soul alreadi benumb and cold
the archdeacon approach her slowli even in that extrem she
beheld him cast an ey sparkl with sensual jealousi and
desir over her expos form then he said aloud
young girl have you ask god pardon for your fault and
shortcom
he bent down to her ear and ad the spectat suppos that
he wa receiv her last confess will you have me i can
still save you
she look intent at him begon demon or i will denounc
you
he gave vent to a horribl smile you will not be believ you
will onli add a scandal to a crime repli quickli will you have
me
what have you done with my phbu
he is dead said the priest
at that moment the wretch archdeacon rais hi head
mechan and beheld at the other end of the place in the
balconi of the gondelauri mansion the captain stand besid
fleurd he stagger pass hi hand across hi ey
look again mutter a curs and all hi featur were
violent contort
well die then he hiss between hi teeth no on shall have
you then rais hi hand over the gypsi he exclaim in a
funer voicei nunc anima ancep et sit tibi deu
misericors48
thi wa the dread formula with which it wa the custom to
conclud these gloomi ceremoni it wa the signal agre upon
between the priest and the execution
the crowd knelt
kyri eleison49 said the priest who had remain beneath
the arch of the portal
kyri eleison repeat the throng in that murmur which run
over all head like the wave of a troubl sea
amen said the archdeacon
he turn hi back on the condemn girl hi head sank upon hi
breast onc more he cross hi hand and rejoin hi escort of
priest and a moment later he wa seen to disappear with the
cross the candl and the cope beneath the misti arch of
the cathedr and hi sonor voic wa extinguish by degre
in the choir as he chant thi vers of despair
omn gurgit tui et fluctu tui super me transierunt50
at the same time the intermitt clash of the iron butt of the
beadl halberd gradual dy awai among the column of the
nave produc the effect of a clock hammer strike the last
hour of the condemn
the door of notredam remain open allow a view of the
empti desol church drape in mourn without candl and

in thi manner he skirt mount saintegenev and final
emerg from the town by the port saintvictor he continu hi
flight as long as he could see when he turn round the
turret enclosur of the univers and the rare hous of the
suburb but when at length a rise of ground had complet
conceal from him that odiou pari when he could believ
himself to be a hundr leagu distant from it in the field
in the desert he halt and it seem to him that he breath
more freeli
then fright idea throng hi mind onc more he could see
clearli into hi soul and he shudder he thought of that
unhappi girl who had destroi him and whom he had destroi he
cast a haggard ey over the doubl tortuou wai which fate had

and as he thu sift hi soul to the bottom when he perceiv
how larg a space natur had prepar there for the passion he

heart all hi hatr all hi malevol and with the cold
glanc of a physician who examin a patient he recogn the
fact that thi malevol wa noth but vitiat love that

himself in make himself a priest made himself a demon then
he laugh frightfulli and suddenli becam pale again when he
consid the most sinist side of hi fatal passion of that
corros venom malign implac love which had end
onli in the gibbet for on of them and in hell for the other

and then hi laughter came again when he reflect that phbu
wa aliv that after all the captain live wa gai and happi
had handsom doublet than ever and a new mistress whom he wa
conduct to see the old on hang hi sneer redoubl it
bitter when he reflect that out of the live be whose
death he had desir the gypsi the onli creatur whom he did
not hate wa the onli on who had not escap him
then from the captain hi thought pass to the peopl and
there came to him a jealousi of an unpreced sort he
reflect that the peopl also the entir populac had had
befor their ey the woman whom he love expos almost nake
he writh hi arm with agoni as he thought that the woman whose
form caught by him alon in the dark would have been suprem
happi had been deliv up in broad daylight at full
noondai to a whole peopl clad as for a night of
voluptu he wept with rage over all these mysteri of
love profan soil laid bare wither forev he wept with
rage as he pictur to himself how mani impur look had been
gratifi at the sight of that badli fasten shift and that
thi beauti girl thi virgin lili thi cup of modesti and
delight to which he would have dare to place hi lip onli
trembl had just been transform into a sort of public bowl
whereat the vilest populac of pari thiev beggar lackei
had come to quaff in common an audaci impur and deprav
pleasur
and when he sought to pictur to himself the happi which he
might have found upon earth if she had not been a gypsi and if
he had not been a priest if phbu had not exist and if she
had love him when he pictur to himself that a life of
seren and love would have been possibl to him also even to
him that there were at that veri moment here and there upon the
earth happi coupl spend the hour in sweet convers beneath
orang tree on the bank of brook in the presenc of a
set sun of a starri night and that if god had so will he
might have form with her on of those bless coupleshi
heart melt in tender and despair
oh she still she it wa thi fix idea which return
incessantli which tortur him which at into hi brain and
rent hi vital he did not regret he did not repent all that
he had done he wa readi to do again he prefer to behold her
in the hand of the execution rather than in the arm of the
captain but he suffer he suffer so that at interv he
tore out hand of hi hair to see whether it were not turn
white
among other moment there came on when it occur to him that
it wa perhap the veri minut when the hideou chain which he
had seen that morn wa press it iron noos closer about
that frail and grace neck thi thought caus the
perspir to start from everi pore
there wa anoth moment when while laugh diabol at
himself he repres to himself la esmeralda as he had seen
her on that first dai live careless joyou gayli attir
danc wing harmoni and la esmeralda of the last dai in
her scanti shift with a rope about her neck mount slowli
with her bare feet the angular ladder of the gallow he figur
to himself thi doubl pictur in such a manner that he gave vent
to a terribl cry
while thi hurrican of despair overturn broke tore up bent
uproot everyth in hi soul he gaze at natur around him
at hi feet some chicken were search the thicket and
peck enamel beetl ran about in the sun overhead some
group of dappl grai cloud were float across the blue sky
on the horizon the spire of the abbei saintvictor pierc the
ridg of the hill with it slate obelisk and the miller of the
copeau hillock wa whistl as he watch the labori wing
of hi mill turn all thi activ organ tranquil life
recur around him under a thousand form hurt him he resum
hi flight
he sped thu across the field until even thi flight from
natur life himself man god everyth last all dai long
sometim he flung himself face downward on the earth and tore
up the young blade of wheat with hi nail sometim he halt
in the desert street of a villag and hi thought were so
intoler that he grasp hi head in both hand and tri to
tear it from hi shoulder in order to dash it upon the pavement
toward the hour of sunset he examin himself again and found
himself nearli mad the tempest which had rage within him ever
sinc the instant when he had lost the hope and the will to save
the gypsythat tempest had not left in hi conscienc a singl
healthi idea a singl thought which maintain it upright
posit hi reason lai there almost entir destroi there
remain but two distinct imag in hi mind la esmeralda and
the gallow all the rest wa blank those two imag unit
present to him a fright group and the more he concentr
what attent and thought wa left to him the more he beheld
them grow in accord with a fantast progress the on in
grace in charm in beauti in light the other in deform and
horror so that at last la esmeralda appear to him like a star
the gibbet like an enorm fleshless arm
on remark fact is that dure the whole of thi tortur
the idea of dy did not serious occur to him the wretch wa
made so he clung to life perhap he realli saw hell beyond it
meanwhil the dai continu to declin the live be which
still exist in him reflect vagu on retrac it step he
believ himself to be far awai from pari on take hi
bear he perceiv that he had onli circl the enclosur of

brisk challeng of the menatarm of the abbei around the
crenel circumscrib wall of saintgermain he turn
asid took a path which present itself between the abbei and
the lazarhous of the bourg and at the expir of a few
minut found himself on the verg of the prauxclerc thi
meadow wa celebr by reason of the brawl which went on there
night and dai it wa the hydra of the poor monk of
saintgermain quod monachi sanctigermaini pratensi hydra
fuit clerici nova semper dissidiorum capita suscitantibu the
archdeacon wa afraid of meet some on there he fear everi
human counten he had just avoid the univers and the
bourg saintgermain he wish to reenter the street as late as
possibl he skirt the prauxclerc took the desert path
which separ it from the dieuneuf and at last reach the
water edg there dom claud found a boatman who for a few
farth in parisian coinag row him up the sein as far as
the point of the citi and land him on that tongu of abandon
land where the reader ha alreadi beheld gringoir dream and
which wa prolong beyond the king garden parallel to the
il du passeurauxvach
the monoton rock of the boat and the rippl of the water
had in some sort quiet the unhappi claud when the boatman
had taken hi departur he remain stand stupidli on the
strand stare straight befor him and perceiv object onli
through magnifi oscil which render everyth a sort
of phantasmagoria to him the fatigu of a great grief not
infrequ produc thi effect on the mind
the sun had set behind the lofti tourdenesl it wa the
twilight hour the sky wa white the water of the river wa
white between these two white expans the left bank of the
sein on which hi ey were fix project it gloomi mass
and render ever thinner and thinner by perspect it plung
into the gloom of the horizon like a black spire it wa load
with hous of which onli the obscur outlin could be
distinguish sharpli brought out in shadow against the light
background of the sky and the water here and there window began
to gleam like the hole in a brazier that immens black obelisk
thu isol between the two white expans of the sky and the
river which wa veri broad at thi point produc upon dom
claud a singular effect compar to that which would be
experienc by a man who reclin on hi back at the foot of
the tower of strasbourg should gaze at the enorm spire
plung into the shadow of the twilight abov hi head onli
in thi case it wa claud who wa erect and the obelisk which
wa ly down but as the river reflect the sky prolong
the abyss below him the immens promontori seem to be as
boldli launch into space as ani cathedr spire and the
impress wa the same thi impress had even on stronger
and more profound point about it that it wa inde the tower of
strasbourg but the tower of strasbourg two leagu in height
someth unheard of gigant immeasur an edific such as
no human ey ha ever seen a tower of babel the chimnei of the

claud in the state of hallucin in which he found himself
believ that he saw that he saw with hi actual ey the bell
tower of hell the thousand light scatter over the whole
height of the terribl tower seem to him so mani porch of the
immens interior furnac the voic and nois which escap
from it seem so mani shriek so mani death groan then he
becam alarm he put hi hand on hi ear that he might no
longer hear turn hi back that he might no longer see and
fled from the fright vision with hasti stride
but the vision wa in himself
when he reenter the street the passersbi elbow each
other by the light of the shopfront produc upon him the
effect of a constant go and come of spectr about him
there were strang nois in hi ear extraordinari fanci
disturb hi brain he saw neither hous nor pavement nor
chariot nor men and women but a chao of indetermin object
whose edg melt into each other at the corner of the rue de
la barilleri there wa a grocer shop whose porch wa
garnish all about accord to immemori custom with hoop
of tin from which hung a circl of wooden candl which came in
contact with each other in the wind and rattl like castanet
he thought he heard a cluster of skeleton at montfaucon clash
togeth in the gloom
oh he mutter the night breez dash them against each
other and mingl the nois of their chain with the rattl of
their bone perhap she is there among them
in hi state of frenzi he knew not whither he wa go after a
few stride he found himself on the pont saintmichel there wa
a light in the window of a groundfloor room he approach
through a crack window he beheld a mean chamber which recal
some confus memori to hi mind in that room badli light by
a meagr lamp there wa a fresh lighthair young man with a
merri face who amid loud burst of laughter wa embrac a veri

thereupon the young man laugh and caress the wench the crone
wa la falourdel the girl wa a courtesan the young man wa hi
brother jehan
he continu to gaze that spectacl wa as good as ani other
he saw jehan go to a window at the end of the room open it cast
a glanc on the quai where in the distanc blaze a thousand
light casement and he heard him sai as he close the sash
pon my soul how dark it is the peopl ar light their
candl and the good god hi star
then jehan came back to the hag smash a bottl stand on the

thi fine pleasantri made the courtesan laugh and jehan left the
room
dom claud had bare time to fling himself on the ground in
order that he might not be met stare in the face and recogn
by hi brother luckili the street wa dark and the scholar wa
tipsi nevertheless he caught sight of the archdeacon prone upon
the earth in the mud
oh oh said he here a fellow who ha been lead a jolli

then dom claud heard him retreat sai
ti all the same reason is a fine thing and my brother the
archdeacon is veri happi in that he is wise and ha monei
then the archdeacon rose to hi feet and ran without halt
toward notredam whose enorm tower he beheld rise abov
the hous through the gloom
at the instant when he arriv pant on the place du parvi
he shrank back and dare not rais hi ey to the fatal edific
oh he said in a low voic is it realli true that such a
thing took place here todai thi veri morn
still he ventur to glanc at the church the front wa sombr
the sky behind wa glitter with star the crescent of the
moon in her flight upward from the horizon had paus at the
moment on the summit of the light hand tower and seem to have
perch itself like a lumin bird on the edg of the
balustrad cut out in black trefoil
the cloister door wa shut but the archdeacon alwai carri
with him the kei of the tower in which hi laboratori wa
situat he made us of it to enter the church
in the church he found the gloom and silenc of a cavern by the
deep shadow which fell in broad sheet from all direct he
recogn the fact that the hang for the ceremoni of the
morn had not yet been remov the great silver cross shone
from the depth of the gloom powder with some sparkl
point like the milki wai of that sepulchr night the long
window of the choir show the upper extrem of their arch
abov the black draperi and their paint pane travers by
a rai of moonlight had no longer ani hue but the doubt color
of night a sort of violet white and blue whose tint is found
onli on the face of the dead the archdeacon on perceiv
these wan spot all around the choir thought he beheld the
mitr of damn bishop he shut hi ey and when he open
them again he thought thei were a circl of pale visag gaze
at him
he start to flee across the church then it seem to him that
the church also wa shake move becom endu with
anim that it wa aliv that each of the great column wa
turn into an enorm paw which wa beat the earth with
it big stone spatula and that the gigant cathedr wa no
longer anyth but a sort of prodigi eleph which wa
breath and march with it pillar for feet it two tower
for trunk and the immens black cloth for it hous
thi fever or mad had reach such a degre of intens that
the extern world wa no longer anyth more for the unhappi
man than a sort of apocalypsevis palpabl terribl
for on moment he wa reliev as he plung into the side
aisl he perceiv a reddish light behind a cluster of pillar
he ran toward it as to a star it wa the poor lamp which
light the public breviari of notredam night and dai beneath
it iron grate he flung himself eagerli upon the holi book in
the hope of find some consol or some encourag
there the hook lai open at thi passag of job over which hi
stare ey glanc
and a spirit pass befor my face and i heard a small voic
and the hair of my flesh stood up
on read these gloomi word he felt that which a blind man
feel when he feel himself prick by the staff which he ha
pick up hi knee gave wai beneath him and he sank upon the
pavement think of her who had di that dai he felt so mani
monstrou vapor pass and discharg themselv in hi brain that
it seem to him that hi head had becom on of the chimnei of
hell
it would appear that he remain a long time in thi attitud no
longer think overwhelm and passiv beneath the hand of the
demon at length some strength return to him it occur to
him to take refug in hi tower besid hi faith quasimodo he
rose and as he wa afraid he took the lamp from the breviari
to light hi wai it wa a sacrileg but he had got beyond
heed such a trifl now
he slowli climb the stair of the tower fill with a secret
fright which must have been commun to the rare passersbi
in the place du parvi by the mysteri light of hi lamp
mount so late from loophol to loophol of the bell tower
all at onc he felt a fresh on hi face and found himself
at the door of the highest galleri the air wa cold the sky wa
fill with hurri cloud whose larg white flake drift
on upon anoth like the break up of river ic after the
winter the crescent of the moon strand in the midst of the
cloud seem a celesti vessel caught in the icecak of the
air
he lower hi gaze and contempl for a moment through the
rail of slender column which unit the two tower far awai
through a gauz of mist and smoke the silent throng of the
roof of pari point innumer crowd and small like the
wave of a tranquil sea on a summer night
the moon cast a feebl rai which impart to earth and heaven an
ashi hue
at that moment the clock rais it shrill crack voic
midnight rang out the priest thought of middai twelv oclock
had come back again
oh he said in a veri low tone she must be cold now
all at onc a gust of wind extinguish hi lamp and almost at
the same instant he beheld a shade a white a form a
woman appear from the opposit angl of the tower he start
besid thi woman wa a littl goat which mingl it bleat with
the last bleat of the clock
he had strength enough to look it wa she
she wa pale she wa gloomi her hair fell over her shoulder as
in the morn but there wa no longer a rope on her neck her
hand were no longer bound she wa free she wa dead
she wa dress in white and had a white veil on her head
she came toward him slowli with her gaze fix on the sky the
supernatur goat follow her he felt as though made of stone
and too heavi to flee at everi step which she took in advanc
he took on backward and that wa all in thi wai he retreat
onc more beneath the gloomi arch of the stairwai he wa chill
by the thought that she might enter there also had she done so
he would have di of terror
she did arriv in fact in front of the door to the stairwai
and paus there for sever minut stare intent into the
dark but without appear to see the priest and pass on
she seem taller to him than when she had been aliv he saw the
moon through her white robe he heard her breath
when she had pass on he began to descend the staircas again
with the slow which he had observ in the spectr believ
himself to be a spectr too haggard with hair on end hi
extinguish lamp still in hi hand and as he descend the
spiral step he distinctli heard in hi ear a voic laugh and
repeat
a spirit pass befor my face and i heard a small voic and
the hair of my flesh stood up

when the bellring dishevel and pant had deposit her

thousand of chimnei which caus the smoke of all the fire in
pari to rise beneath her ey a sad sight for the poor gypsi a
foundl condemn to death an unhappi creatur without

kiss
oh djali she said how i have forgotten thee and so thou
still thinkest of me oh thou art not an ingrat
at the same time as though an invis hand had lift the
weight which had repress her tear in her heart for so long
she began to weep and in proport as her tear flow she
felt all that wa most acrid and bitter in her grief depart with
them
even came she thought the night so beauti that she made
the circuit of the elev galleri which surround the church
it afford her some relief so calm did the earth appear when

chapter iv earthenwar and crystal
dai follow dai calm gradual return to the soul of la
esmeralda excess of grief like excess of joi is a violent thing
which last but a short time the heart of man cannot remain long
in on extrem the gypsi had suffer so much that noth
wa left her but astonish with secur hope had return
to her she wa outsid the pale of societi outsid the pale of
life but she had a vagu feel that it might not be imposs
to return to it she wa like a dead person who should hold in
reserv the kei to her tomb
she felt the terribl imag which had so long persecut her
gradual depart all the hideou phantom pierrat torteru
jacqu charmolu were effac from her mind all even the
priest
and then phbu wa aliv she wa sure of it she had seen him
to her the fact of phbu be aliv wa everyth after the
seri of fatal shock which had overturn everyth within
her she had found but on thing intact in her soul on
sentimenth love for the captain love is like a tree it
sprout forth of itself send it root out deepli through our
whole be and often continu to flourish greenli over a heart
in ruin
and the inexplic point about it is that the more blind is
thi passion the more tenaci it is it is never more solid
than when it ha no reason in it
la esmeralda did not think of the captain without bitter no
doubt no doubt it wa terribl that he also should have been
deceiv that he should have believ that imposs thing
that he could have conceiv of a stab dealt by her who would
have given a thousand live for him but after all she must not
be too angri with him for it had she not confess her crime
had she not yield weak woman that she wa to tortur the
fault wa entir her she should have allow her finger nail
to be torn out rather than such a word to be wrench from her
in short if she could but see phbu onc more for a singl
minut onli on word would be requir on look in order to
undec him to bring him back she did not doubt it she wa
astonish also at mani singular thing at the accid of
phbuss presenc on the dai of the penanc at the young girl
with whom he had been she wa hi sister no doubt an
unreason explan but she content herself with it
becaus she need to believ that phbu still love her and
love her alon had he not sworn it to her what more wa
need simpl and credul as she wa and then in thi
matter were not appear much more against her than against
him accordingli she wait she hope
let us add that the church that vast church which surround
her on everi side which guard her which save her wa itself
a sovereign tranquil the solemn line of that architectur
the religi attitud of all the object which surround the
young girl the seren and piou thought which eman so to
speak from all the pore of that stone act upon her without
her be awar of it the edific had also sound fraught with
such benedict and such majesti that thei sooth thi ail
soul the monoton chant of the celebr the respons of
the peopl to the priest sometim inarticul sometim
thunder the harmoni trembl of the paint window the
organ burst forth like a hundr trumpet the three
belfri hum like hive of huge bee that whole orchestra
on which bound a gigant scale ascend descend
incessantli from the voic of a throng to that of on bell
dull her memori her imagin her grief the bell in
particular lull her it wa someth like a power
magnet which those vast instrument shed over her in great
wave
thu everi sunris found her more calm breath better less
pale in proport as her inward wound close her grace and
beauti blossom onc more on her counten but more
thought more repos her former charact also return to
her somewhat even of her gayeti her pretti pout her love for
her goat her love for sing her modesti she took care to
dress herself in the morn in the corner of her cell for fear
some inhabit of the neighbor attic might see her through
the window
when the thought of phbu left her time the gypsi sometim
thought of quasimodo he wa the sole bond the sole connect
the sole commun which remain to her with men with the
live unfortun girl she wa more outsid the world than
quasimodo she understood not in the least the strang friend
whom chanc had given her she often reproach herself for not
feel a gratitud which should close her ey but decidedli
she could not accustom herself to the poor bellring he wa too
ugli
she had left the whistl which he had given her ly on the
ground thi did not prevent quasimodo from make hi appear
from time to time dure the first few dai she did her best not
to turn asid with too much repugn when he came to bring her
her basket of provis or her jug of water but he alwai
perceiv the slightest movement of thi sort and then he
withdrew sadli
onc he came at the moment when she wa caress djali he stood
pensiv for sever minut befor thi grace group of the
goat and the gypsi at last he said shake hi heavi and
illform head
my misfortun is that i still resembl a man too much i should
like to be wholli a beast like that goat
she gaze at him in amaz
he repli to the glanc
oh i well know why and he went awai
on anoth occas he present himself at the door of the cell
which he never enter at the moment when la esmeralda wa
sing an old spanish ballad the word of which she did not
understand but which had linger in her ear becaus the gypsi
women had lull her to sleep with it when she wa a littl
child at the sight of that villan form which made it
appear so abruptli in the middl of her song the young girl
paus with an involuntari gestur of alarm the unhappi
bellring fell upon hi knee on the threshold and clasp hi
larg misshapen hand with a suppliant air oh he said
sorrowfulli continu i implor you and do not drive me awai
she did not wish to pain him and resum her lai trembl all
over by degre howev her terror disappear and she
yield herself wholli to the slow and melancholi air which she
wa sing he remain on hi knee with hand clasp as in
prayer attent hardli breath hi gaze rivet upon the
gypsi brilliant ey
on anoth occas he came to her with an awkward and timid
air listen he said with an effort i have someth to sai
to you she made him a sign that she wa listen then he
began to sigh half open hi lip appear for a moment to be
on the point of speak then he look at her again shook hi
head and withdrew slowli with hi brow in hi hand leav the
gypsi stupefi among the grotesqu personag sculptur on the
wall there wa on to whom he wa particularli attach and
with which he often seem to exchang fratern glanc onc
the gypsi heard him sai to it
oh why am not i of stone like you
at last on morn la esmeralda had advanc to the edg of
the roof and wa look into the place over the point roof of
saintjean le rond quasimodo wa stand behind her he had
place himself in that posit in order to spare the young girl
as far as possibl the displeasur of see him all at onc
the gypsi start a tear and a flash of joi gleam
simultan in her ey she knelt on the brink of the roof
and extend her arm toward the place with anguish exclaim
phbu come come a word a singl word in the name of heaven
phbu phbu her voic her face her gestur her whole
person bore the heartrend express of a shipwreck man who
is make a signal of distress to the joyou vessel which is
pass afar off in a rai of sunlight on the horizon
quasimodo lean over the place and saw that the object of thi
tender and agon prayer wa a young man a captain a
handsom cavali all glitter with arm and decor
pranc across the end of the place and salut with hi plume
a beauti ladi who wa smile at him from her balconi
howev the offic did not hear the unhappi girl call him
he wa too far awai
but the poor deaf man heard a profound sigh heav hi breast
he turn round hi heart wa swollen with all the tear which
he wa swallow hi convulsivelyclench fist struck against
hi head and when he withdrew them there wa a bunch of red hair
in each hand
the gypsi paid no heed to him he said in a low voic as he
gnash hi teeth
damnat that is what on should be like ti onli necessari
to be handsom on the outsid
meanwhil she remain kneel and cri with extraordinari
agit
oh there he is alight from hi hors he is about to enter

bellring ey fill with tear but he let none fall all at
onc he pull her gentli by the border of her sleev she turn
round he had assum a tranquil air he said to her

she utter a cry of joi
oh go hasten run quick that captain that captain bring
him to me i will love you for it
she clasp hi knee he could not refrain from shake hi head
sadli
i will bring him to you he said in a weak voic then he
turn hi head and plung down the staircas with great
stride stifl with sob
when he reach the place he no longer saw anyth except the
handsom hors hitch at the door of the gondelauri hous the
captain had just enter there
he rais hi ey to the roof of the church la esmeralda wa
there in the same spot in the same attitud he made her a sad
sign with hi head then he plant hi back against on of the
stone post of the gondelauri porch determin to wait until
the captain should come forth
in the gondelauri hous it wa on of those gala dai which
preced a wed quasimodo beheld mani peopl enter but no on
come out he cast a glanc toward the roof from time to time
the gypsi did not stir ani more than himself a groom came and
unhitch the hors and led it to the stabl of the hous
the entir dai pass thu quasimodo at hi post la esmeralda
on the roof phbu no doubt at the feet of fleurd
at length night came a moonless night a dark night quasimodo
fix hi gaze in vain upon la esmeralda soon she wa no more
than a white amid the twilight then noth all wa
effac all wa black
quasimodo beheld the front window from top to bottom of the
gondelauri mansion illumin he saw the other casement in
the place light on by on he also saw them extinguish to
the veri last for he remain the whole even at hi post the
offic did not come forth when the last passersbi had return
home when the window of all the other hous were extinguish
quasimodo wa left entir alon entir in the dark there
were at that time no lamp in the squar befor notredam
meanwhil the window of the gondelauri mansion remain
light even after midnight quasimodo motionless and
attent beheld a throng of live danc shadow pass
athwart the manycolor paint pane had he not been deaf he
would have heard more and more distinctli in proport as the
nois of sleep pari di awai a sound of feast laughter
and music in the gondelauri mansion
toward on oclock in the morn the guest began to take
their leav quasimodo shroud in dark watch them all
pass out through the porch illumin with torch none of them
wa the captain
he wa fill with sad thought at time he look upward into
the air like a person who is weari of wait great black
cloud heavi torn split hung like crape hammock beneath the
starri dome of night on would have pronounc them spider
web of the vault of heaven
in on of these moment he suddenli beheld the long window on the
balconi whose stone balustrad project abov hi head open
mysteri the frail glass door gave passag to two person
and close noiselessli behind them it wa a man and a woman
it wa not without difficulti that quasimodo succeed in
recogn in the man the handsom captain in the woman the
young ladi whom he had seen welcom the offic in the morn
from that veri balconi the place wa perfectli dark and a
doubl crimson curtain which had fallen across the door the veri
moment it close again allow no light to reach the balconi
from the apart
the young man and the young girl so far as our deaf man could
judg without hear a singl on of their word appear to
abandon themselv to a veri tender ttett the young girl
seem to have allow the offic to make a girdl for her of
hi arm and gentli repuls a kiss
quasimodo look on from below at thi scene which wa all the
more pleas to wit becaus it wa not meant to be seen he
contempl with bitter that beauti that happi after
all natur wa not dumb in the poor fellow and hi human
sensibl all malici contort as it wa quiver no
less than ani other he thought of the miser portion which
provid had allot to him that woman and the pleasur of
love would pass forev befor hi ey and that he should
never do anyth but behold the felic of other but that
which rent hi heart most in thi sight that which mingl
indign with hi anger wa the thought of what the gypsi
would suffer could she behold it it is true that the night wa
veri dark that la esmeralda if she had remain at her post
and he had no doubt of thi wa veri far awai and that it wa
all that he himself could do to distinguish the lover on the
balconi thi consol him
meanwhil their convers grew more and more anim the
young ladi appear to be entreat the offic to ask noth
more of her of all thi quasimodo could distinguish onli the
beauti clasp hand the smile mingl with tear the young

thi word did inde produc a great effect on phbu but not
of the kind which the deaf man expect it will be rememb
that our gallant offic had retir with fleurd sever
moment befor quasimodo had rescu the condemn girl from the
hand of charmolu afterward in all hi visit to the
gondelauri mansion he had taken care not to mention that woman
the memori of whom wa after all pain to him and on her
side fleurd had not deem it polit to tell him that the
gypsi wa aliv henc phbu believ poor similar to be dead
and that a month or two had elaps sinc her death let us add
that for the last few moment the captain had been reflect on
the profound dark of the night the supernatur ugli

midnight that the street wa desert as on the even when
the surli monk had accost him and that hi hors snort as it

at the summit of the tower of the bellring face turn
sadli to her but as soon as she perceiv him he disappear
we must admit that she wa not much griev by thi voluntari
absenc on the part of the poor hunchback at the bottom of her
heart she wa grate to him for it moreov quasimodo did not
deceiv himself on thi point
she no longer saw him but she felt the presenc of a good geniu

climb up to that carv must have risk hi life
sometim in the even she heard a voic conceal beneath
the wind screen of the bell tower sing a sad strang song
as though to lull her to sleep the line were unrhym such as
a deaf person can make

quasimodo to save her he wa the wit of a thousand littl
scene between the gypsi and the deaf man the pantomim of
which view from afar and comment on by hi passion appear
veri tender to him he distrust the caprici of women
then he felt a jealousi which he could never have believ
possibl awaken within him a jealousi which made him redden
with shame and indign on might condon the captain but
thi on thi thought upset him
hi night were fright as soon as he learn that the gypsi

chapter iv an awkward friend
that night quasimodo did not sleep he had just made hi last
round of the church he had not notic that at the moment when
he wa close the door the archdeacon had pass close to him
and betrai some displeasur on see him bolt and bar
with care the enorm iron lock which gave to their larg
leav the solid of a wall dom claud air wa even more
preoccupi than usual moreov sinc the nocturn adventur
in the cell he had constantli abus quasimodo but in vain did
he ill treat and even beat him occasion noth disturb
the submiss patienc the devot resign of the faith
bellring he endur everyth on the part of the archdeacon
insult threat blow without murmur a complaint at the
most he gaze uneasili after dom claud when the latter ascend
the staircas of the tower but the archdeacon had abstain from
present himself again befor the gypsi ey
on that night accordingli quasimodo after have cast a glanc
at hi poor bell which he so neglect now jacquelin mari
and thibauld mount to the summit of the northern tower and
there set hi dark lanturn well close upon the lead he
began to gaze at pari the night as we have alreadi said wa
veri dark pari which so to speak wa not light at that
epoch present to the ey a confus collect of black
mass cut here and there by the whitish curv of the sein
quasimodo no longer saw ani light with the except of on
window in a distant edific whose vagu and sombr profil wa
outlin well abov the roof in the direct of the port
sainteantoin there also there wa some on awak
as the onli ey of the bellring peer into that horizon of
mist and night he felt within him an inexpress uneasi
for sever dai he had been upon hi guard he had perceiv men
of sinist mien who never took their ey from the young girl
asylum prowl constantli about the church he fanci that
some plot might be in process of format against the unhappi
refuge he imagin that there exist a popular hatr against
her as against himself and that it wa veri possibl that
someth might happen soon henc he remain upon hi tower on
the watch dream in hi dreamplac as rabelai sai with
hi ey direct altern on the cell and on pari keep
faith guard like a good dog with a thousand suspicion in
hi mind
all at onc while he wa scrutin the great citi with that
ey which natur by a sort of compens had made so pierc
that it could almost suppli the other organ which quasimodo
lack it seem to him that there wa someth singular about
the quai de la vieillepelleteri that there wa a movement at
that point that the line of the parapet stand out blackli
against the white of the water wa not straight and tranquil
like that of the other quai but that it undul to the ey
like the wave of a river or like the head of a crowd in
motion
thi struck him as strang he redoubl hi attent the
movement seem to be advanc toward the citi there wa no
light it last for some time on the quai then it gradual
ceas as though that which wa pass were enter the
interior of the island then it stop altogeth and the line
of the quai becam straight and motionless again
at the moment when quasimodo wa lost in conjectur it seem
to him that the movement had reappear in the rue du parvi
which is prolong into the citi perpendicularli to the faad of
notredam at length dens as wa the dark he beheld the
head of a column debouch from that street and in an instant a
crowdof which noth could be distinguish in the gloom except
that it wa a crowdspread over the place
thi spectacl had a terror of it own it is probabl that thi
singular process which seem so desir of conceal
itself under profound dark maintain a silenc no less
profound nevertheless some nois must have escap it were it
onli a trampl but thi nois did not even reach our deaf man
and thi great multitud of which he saw hardli anyth and of
which he heard noth though it wa march and move so near
him produc upon him the effect of a rabbl of dead men mute
impalp lost in a smoke it seem to him that he beheld
advanc toward him a fog of men and that he saw shadow
move in the shadow
then hi fear return to him the idea of an attempt against
the gypsi present itself onc more to hi mind he wa
consciou in a confus wai that a violent crisi wa
approach at that critic moment he took counsel with
himself with better and prompter reason than on would have
expect from so badli organ a brain ought he to awaken the
gypsi to make her escap whither the street were invest
the church back on the river no boat no issuether wa but
on thing to be done to allow himself to be kill on the
threshold of notredam to resist at least until succor arriv
if it should arriv and not to troubl la esmeralda sleep
thi resolut onc taken he set to examin the enemi with
more tranquil
the throng seem to increas everi moment in the church squar
onli he presum that it must be make veri littl nois sinc
the window on the place remain close all at onc a flame
flash up and in an instant seven or eight light torch
pass over the head of the crowd shake their tuft of flame
in the deep shade quasimodo then beheld distinctli surg in
the parvi a fright herd of men and women in rag arm with
scyth pike billhook and partisan whose thousand point
glitter here and there black pitchfork form horn to the
hideou face he vagu recal thi populac and thought
that he recogn all the head who had salut him as pope of
the fool some month previous on man who held a torch in on
hand and a club in the other mount a stone post and seem to
be harangu them at the same time the strang armi execut
sever evolut as though it were take up it post around
the church quasimodo pick up hi lantern and descend to the
platform between the tower in order to get a nearer view and
to spy out a mean of defenc
clopin trouillef on arriv in front of the lofti portal of
notredam had in fact rang hi troop in order of battl

gener to preserv an order which would permit him to face at

the giant of stone
at the shock of the beam the half metal door sound like an

the reader ha no doubt divin that thi unexpect resist
which had exasper the outcast came from quasimodo
chanc had unfortun favor the brave deaf man
when he had descend to the platform between the tower hi
idea were all in confus he had run up and down along the
galleri for sever minut like a madman survei from abov
the compact mass of vagabond readi to hurl itself on the church
demand the safeti of the gypsi from the devil or from god the
thought had occur to him of ascend to the southern belfri
and sound the alarm but befor he could have set the bell in
motion befor mari voic could have utter a singl clamor
wa there not time to burst in the door of the church ten time
over it wa precis the moment when the locksmith were
advanc upon it with their tool what wa to be done
all at onc he rememb that some mason had been at work all
dai repair the wall the timberwork and the roof of the
south tower thi wa a flash of light the wall wa of stone
the roof of lead the timberwork of wood that prodigi
timberwork so dens that it wa call the forest
quasimodo hasten to that tower the lower chamber were in
fact full of materi there were pile of rough block of
stone sheet of lead in roll bundl of lath heavi beam
alreadi notch with the saw heap of plaster
time wa press the pike and hammer were at work below with
a strength which the sens of danger increas tenfold he seiz
on of the beamsth longest and heaviest he push it out
through a loophol then grasp it again outsid of the tower
he made it slide along the angl of the balustrad which
surround the platform and let it fly into the abyss the
enorm timber dure that fall of a hundr and sixti feet
scrape the wall break the carv turn mani time on
it centr like the arm of a windmil fly off alon through
space at last it reach the ground the horribl cry aros and
the black beam as it rebound from the pavement resembl a
serpent leap
quasimodo beheld the outcast scatter at the fall of the beam
like ash at the breath of a child he took advantag of their
fright and while thei were fix a superstiti glanc on the
club which had fallen from heaven and while thei were put
out the ey of the stone saint on the front with a discharg of
arrow and buckshot quasimodo wa silent pile up plaster
stone and rough block of stone even the sack of tool
belong to the mason on the edg of the balustrad from which
the beam had alreadi been hurl
thu as soon as thei began to batter the grand door the shower
of rough block of stone began to fall and it seem to them
that the church itself wa be demolish over their head
ani on who could have beheld quasimodo at that moment would have
been frighten independ of the projectil which he had
pile upon the balustrad he had collect a heap of stone on
the platform itself as fast as the block on the exterior edg
were exhaust he drew on the heap then he stoop and rose
stoop and rose again with incred activ hi huge gnome
head bent over the balustrad then an enorm stone fell then
anoth then anoth from time to time he follow a fine
stone with hi ey and when it did good execut he said
hum
meanwhil the beggar did not grow discourag the thick door
on which thei were vent their furi had alreadi trembl more
than twenti time beneath the weight of their oaken
batteringram multipli by the strength of a hundr men the
panel crack the carv work flew into splinter the hing
at everi blow leap from their pin the plank yawn the
wood crumbl to powder ground between the iron sheath
fortun for quasimodo there wa more iron than wood
nevertheless he felt that the great door wa yield although
he did not hear it everi blow of the ram reverber
simultan in the vault of the church and within it from
abov he beheld the vagabond fill with triumph and rage
shake their fist at the gloomi faad and both on the gypsi
account and hi own he envi the wing of the owl which flit
awai abov hi head in flock
hi shower of stone block wa not suffici to repel the
assail
at thi moment of anguish he notic a littl lower down than
the balustrad whenc he wa crush the thiev two long stone
gutter which discharg immedi over the great door the

he remain thu for more than an hour without make a movement
with hi ey fix on the desert cell more gloomi and more
pensiv than a mother seat between an empti cradl and a full

heav hi bodi violent but it wa a tearless sob like summer
lightn which make no nois
it appear to have been then that seek at the bottom of hi
lone thought for the unexpect abductor of the gypsi he
thought of the archdeacon he rememb that dom claud alon
possess a kei to the staircas lead to the cell he recal
hi nocturn attempt on the young girl in the first of which
he quasimodo had assist the second of which he had

doubt that the archdeacon had taken the gypsi nevertheless
such wa hi respect for the priest such hi gratitud hi
devot hi love for thi man had taken such deep root in hi
heart that thei resist even at thi moment the talon of
jealousi and despair
he reflect that the archdeacon had done thi thing and the
wrath of blood and death which it would have evok in him
against ani other person turn in the poor deaf man from the
moment when claud frollo wa in question into an increas of
grief and sorrow
at the moment when hi thought wa thu fix upon the priest
while the daybreak wa whiten the fly buttress he
perceiv on the highest stori of notredam at the angl form
by the extern balustrad as it make the turn of the chancel a
figur walk thi figur wa come toward him he recogn
it it wa the archdeacon
claud wa walk with a slow grave step he did not look
befor him as he walk he wa direct hi cours toward the
northern tower but hi face wa turn asid toward the right
bank of the sein and he held hi head high as though try to
see someth over the roof the owl often assum thi obliqu
attitud it fli toward on point and look toward anoth
in thi manner the priest pass abov quasimodo without see
him
the deaf man who had been petrifi by thi sudden apparit
beheld him disappear through the door of the staircas to the
north tower the reader is awar that thi is the tower from
which the hteldevil is visibl quasimodo rose and follow
the archdeacon
quasimodo ascend the tower staircas for the sake of ascend
it for the sake of see why the priest wa ascend it
moreov the poor bellring did not know what he quasimodo
should do what he should sai what he wish he wa full of
furi and full of fear the archdeacon and the gypsi had come into
conflict in hi heart
when he reach the summit of the tower befor emerg from the
shadow of the staircas and step upon the platform he
cautious examin the posit of the priest the priest back
wa turn to him there is an openwork balustrad which
surround the platform of the bell tower the priest whose ey
look down upon the town wa rest hi breast on that on of
the four side of the balustrad which look upon the pont
notredam
quasimodo advanc with the tread of a wolf behind him went to
see what he wa gaze at thu
the priest attent wa so absorb elsewher that he did not
hear the deaf man walk behind him
pari is a magnific and charm spectacl and especi at

fresh light of a summer dawn the dai might have been in juli
the sky wa perfectli seren some tardi star were fade awai
at variou point and there wa a veri brilliant on in the
east in the brightest part of the heaven the sun wa about to
appear pari wa begin to move a veri white and veri pure
light brought out vividli to the ey all the outlin that it
thousand of hous present to the east the giant shadow of the
tower leap from roof to roof from on end of the great citi

heard voic and noisi sound here the stroke of a bell there
the stroke of a hammer beyond the complic clatter of a cart
in motion
alreadi sever column of smoke were be belch forth from
the chimnei scatter over the whole surfac of roof as
through the fissur of an immens sulphur crater the river
which ruffl it water against the arch of so mani bridg
against the point of so mani island wa waver with silveri
fold around the citi outsid the rampart sight wa lost in a
great circl of fleeci vapor through which on confusedli
distinguish the indefinit line of the plain and the grace
swell of the height all sort of float sound were dispers
over thi halfawaken citi toward the east the morn
breez chase a few soft white bit of wool torn from the misti
fleec of the hill
in the parvi some good women who had their milk jug in their
hand were point out to each other with astonish the
singular dilapid of the great door of notredam and the
two solidifi stream of lead in the crevic of the stone thi
wa all that remain of the tempest of the night the bonfir
light between the tower by quasimodo had di out tristan had
alreadi clear up the place and had the dead thrown into the
sein king like loui xi ar care to clean the pavement
quickli after a massacr
outsid the balustrad of the tower directli under the point
where the priest had paus there wa on of those fantast
carv stone gutter with which gothic edific bristl and in
a crevic of that gutter two pretti wallflow in blossom
shaken out and vivifi as it were by the breath of air made
frolicsom salut to each other abov the tower on high
far awai in the depth of the sky the cri of littl bird were
heard
but the priest wa not listen to wa not look at anyth
of all thi he wa on of the men for whom there ar no
morn no bird no flower in that immens horizon which
assum so mani aspect about him hi contempl wa
concentr on a singl point
quasimodo wa burn to ask him what he had done with the gypsi
but the archdeacon seem to be out of the world at that moment
he wa evid in on of those violent moment of life when on
would not feel the earth crumbl he remain motionless and
silent with hi ey steadili fix on a certain point and
there wa someth so terribl about thi silenc and immobl
that the savag bellring shudder befor it and dare not come
in contact with it onli and thi wa also on wai of
interrog the archdeacon he follow the direct of hi
vision and in thi wai the glanc of the unhappi deaf man fell
upon the place de grve
thu he saw what the priest wa look at the ladder wa
erect near the perman gallow there were some peopl and
mani soldier in the place a man wa drag a white thing
from which hung someth black along the pavement thi man
halt at the foot of the gallow
here someth took place which quasimodo could not see veri
clearli it wa not becaus hi onli ey had not preserv it
long rang but there wa a group of soldier which prevent hi
see everyth moreov at that moment the sun appear and
such a flood of light overflow the horizon that on would have
said that all the point in pari spire chimnei gabl had
simultan taken fire
meanwhil the man began to mount the ladder then quasimodo saw
him again distinctli he wa carri a woman on hi shoulder a
young girl dress in white that young girl had a noos about
her neck quasimodo recogn her
it wa she
the man reach the top of the ladder there he arrang the
noos here the priest in order to see the better knelt upon
the balustrad
all at onc the man kick awai the ladder abruptli and
quasimodo who had not breath for sever moment beheld the
unhappi child dangl at the end of the rope two fathom abov
the pavement with the man squat on her shoulder the rope
made sever gyrat on itself and quasimodo beheld horribl
convuls run along the gypsi bodi the priest on hi side
with outstretch neck and ey start from hi head
contempl thi horribl group of the man and the young
girlth spider and the fly
at the moment when it wa most horribl the laugh of a demon a
laugh which on can onli give vent to when on is no longer
human burst forth on the priest livid face
quasimodo did not hear that laugh but he saw it
the bellring retreat sever pace behind the archdeacon and
suddenli hurl himself upon him with furi with hi huge hand
he push him by the back over into the abyss over which dom
claud wa lean
the priest shriek damnat and fell
the spout abov which he had stood arrest him in hi fall he
clung to it with desper hand and at the moment when he
open hi mouth to utter a second cry he beheld the formid
and aveng face of quasimodo thrust over the edg of the
balustrad abov hi head
then he wa silent
the abyss wa there below him a fall of more than two hundr
feet and the pavement
in thi terribl situat the archdeacon said not a word
utter not a groan he mere writh upon the spout with
incred effort to climb up again but hi hand had no hold
on the granit hi feet slid along the blacken wall without
catch fast peopl who have ascend the tower of notredam
know that there is a swell of the stone immedi beneath the
balustrad it wa on thi retreat angl that miser
archdeacon exhaust himself he had not to deal with a
perpendicular wall but with on which slope awai beneath him
quasimodo had but to stretch out hi hand in order to draw him
from the gulf but he did not even look at him he wa look at
the grve he wa look at the gallow he wa look at the
gypsi
the deaf man wa lean with hi elbow on the balustrad at
the spot where the archdeacon had been a moment befor and
there never detach hi gaze from the onli object which
exist for him in the world at that moment he remain
motionless and mute like a man struck by lightn and a long
stream of tear flow in silenc from that ey which up to that
time had never shed but on tear
meanwhil the archdeacon wa pant hi bald brow wa drip
with perspir hi nail were bleed against the stone
hi knee were flai by the wall
he heard hi cassock which wa caught on the spout crack and
rip at everi jerk that he gave it to complet hi misfortun
thi spout end in a leaden pipe which bent under the weight of
hi bodi the archdeacon felt thi pipe slowli give wai the
miser man said to himself that when hi hand should be worn
out with fatigu when hi cassock should tear asund when the
lead should give wai he would be oblig to fall and terror
seiz upon hi veri vital now and then he glanc wildli at a
sort of narrow shelf form ten feet lower down by project
of the sculptur and he prai heaven from the depth of hi
distress soul that he might be allow to finish hi life
were it to last two centuri on that space two feet squar
onc he glanc below him into the place into the abyss the
head which he rais again had it ey close and it hair
stand erect
there wa someth fright in the silenc of these two men
while the archdeacon agon in thi terribl fashion a few feet
below him quasimodo wept and gaze at the grve
the archdeacon see that all hi exert serv onli to
weaken the fragil support which remain to him decid to
remain quiet there he hung embrac the gutter hardli
breath no longer stir make no longer ani other
movement than that mechan convuls of the stomach which
on experi in dream when on fanci himself fall hi
fix ey were wide open with a stare he lost ground littl by
littl nevertheless hi finger slip along the spout he
becam more and more consciou of the feebl of hi arm and
the weight of hi bodi the curv of the lead which sustain him
inclin more and more each instant toward the abyss
he beheld below him a fright thing the roof of saintjean le
rond as small as a card fold in two he gaze at the
impress carv on by on of the tower suspend like
himself over the precipic but without terror for themselv or
piti for him all wa stone around him befor hi ey gape
monster below quit at the bottom in the place the pavement
abov hi head quasimodo weep
in the parvi there were sever group of curiou good peopl
who were tranquilli seek to divin who the madman could be who
wa amus himself in so strang a manner the priest heard them
sai for their voic reach him clear and shrill why he
will break hi neck
quasimodo wept
at last the archdeacon foam with rage and despair understood
that all wa in vain nevertheless he collect all the strength
which remain to him for a final effort he stiffen himself
upon the spout push against the wall with both hi knee
clung to a crevic in the stone with hi hand and succeed in
climb back with on foot perhap but thi effort made the
leaden beak on which he rest bend abruptli hi cassock burst
open at the same time then feel everyth give wai beneath
him with noth but hi stiffen and fail hand to support
him the unfortun man close hi ey and let go of the spout
he fell
quasimodo watch him fall
a fall from such a height is seldom perpendicular the
archdeacon launch into space fell at first head foremost
with outspread hand then he whirl over and over mani time
the wind blew him upon the roof of a hous where the unfortun
man began to break up nevertheless he wa not dead when he
reach there the bellring saw him still endeavor to cling to
a gabl with hi nail but the surfac slope too much and he
had no more strength he slid rapidli along the roof like a
loosen tile and dash upon the pavement there he no longer
move
then quasimodo rais hi ey to the gypsi whose bodi he beheld
hang from the gibbet quiver far awai beneath her white
robe with the last shudder of anguish then he drop them
on the archdeacon stretch out at the base of the tower and no
longer retain the human form and he said with a sob which
heav hi deep chestoh all that i have ever love
chapter iii the marriag of phoebu
toward even on that dai when the judiciari offic of the
bishop came to pick up from the pavement of the parvi the
disloc corps of the archdeacon quasimodo had disappear
a great mani rumor were in circul with regard to thi
adventur no on doubt but that the dai had come when in
accord with their compact quasimodo that is to sai the
devil wa to carri off claud frollo that is to sai the
sorcer it wa presum that he had broken the bodi when take
the soul like monkei who break the shell to get at the nut
thi is why the archdeacon wa not inter in consecr earth

chapter iv the marriag of quasimodo
we have just said that quasimodo disappear from notredam on
the dai of the gypsi and of the archdeacon death he wa not
seen again in fact no on knew what had becom of him
dure the night which follow the execut of la esmeralda
the night men had detach her bodi from the gibbet and had
carri it accord to custom to the cellar of montfaucon
montfaucon wa as sauval sai the most ancient and the most
superb gibbet in the kingdom between the faubourg of the
templ and saint martin about a hundr and sixti tois from
the wall of pari a few bow shot from la courtil there wa
to be seen on the crest of a gentl almost impercept
emin but suffici elev to be seen for sever
leagu round about an edific of strang form bear
consider resembl to a celtic cromlech and where also
human sacrific were offer
let the reader pictur to himself crown a limeston hillock
an oblong mass of masonri fifteen feet in height thirti wide
forti long with a gate an extern rail and a platform on
thi platform sixteen enorm pillar of rough hewn stone
thirti feet in height arrang in a colonnad round three of the
four side of the mass which support them bound togeth at
their summit by heavi beam whenc hung chain at interv on
all these chain skeleton in the vicin on the plain a
stone cross and two gibbet of secondari import which seem
to have sprung up as shoot around the central gallow abov all
thi in the sky a perpetu flock of crow that wa
montfaucon
at the end of the fifteenth centuri the formid gibbet which
date from 1328 wa alreadi veri much dilapid the beam
were wormeaten the chain rust the pillar green with mould
the layer of hewn stone were all crack at their joint and
grass wa grow on that platform which no feet touch the
monument made a horribl profil against the sky especi at
night when there wa a littl moonlight on those white skull or
when the breez of even brush the chain and the skeleton
and swai all these in the dark the presenc of thi gibbet
suffic to render gloomi all the surround place
the mass of masonri which serv as foundat to the odiou
edific wa hollow a huge cellar had been construct there
close by an old iron grate which wa out of order into which
were cast not onli the human remain which were taken from the
chain of montfaucon but also the bodi of all the unfortun
execut on the other perman gibbet of pari to that deep
charnelhous where so mani human remain and so mani crime
have rot in compani mani great on of thi world mani
innoc peopl have contribut their bone from enguerrand de
marigni the first victim and a just man to admir de coligni
who wa it last and who wa also a just man
as for the mysteri disappear of quasimodo thi is all
that we have been abl to discov
about eighteen month or two year after the event which
termin thi stori when search wa made in that cavern for the
bodi of olivi le daim who had been hang two dai previous
and to whom charl viii had grant the favor of be buri
in saint laurent in better compani thei found among all those
hideou carcass two skeleton on of which held the other in
it embrac on of these skeleton which wa that of a woman
still had a few strip of a garment which had onc been white
and around her neck wa to be seen a string of adrzarach bead
with a littl silk bag ornament with green glass which wa
open and empti these object were of so littl valu that the
execution had probabl not care for them the other which
held thi on in a close embrac wa the skeleton of a man it
wa notic that hi spinal column wa crook hi head seat
on hi shoulder blade and that on leg wa shorter than the
other moreov there wa no fractur of the vertebra at the
nape of the neck and it wa evid that he had not been hang
henc the man to whom it had belong had come thither and had
di there when thei tri to detach the skeleton which he held
in hi embrac he fell to dust
note
ad to the definit edit
it is by mistak that thi edit wa announc as augment by
mani new chapter the word should have been unpublish in
fact if by new newli made is to be understood the chapter
ad to thi edit ar not new thei were written at the same
time as the rest of the work thei date from the same epoch and
sprang from the same thought thei have alwai form a part of
the manuscript of notredamedepari moreov the author
cannot comprehend how fresh develop could be ad to a work
of thi charact after it complet thi is not to be done at
will accord to hi idea a romanc is born in a manner that
is in some sort necessari with all it chapter a drama is
born with all it scene think not that there is anyth
arbitrari in the number of part of which that whole that
mysteri microcosm which you call a drama or a romanc is
compos graft and solder take badli on work of thi
natur which should gush forth in a singl stream and so remain
the thing onc done do not chang your mind do not touch it up
the book onc publish the sex of the work whether viril or
not ha been recogn and proclaim when the child ha onc
utter hi first cry he is born there he is he is made so
neither father nor mother can do anyth he belong to the air
and to the sun let him live or die such as he is ha your book
been a failur so much the wors add no chapter to an
unsuccess book is it incomplet you should have complet it
when you conceiv it is your tree crook you cannot
straighten it up is your romanc consumpt is your romanc
not capabl of live you cannot suppli it with the breath which
it lack ha your drama been born lame take my advic and do
not provid it with a wooden leg
henc the author attach particular import to the public
know for a certainti that the chapter here ad have not
been made expressli for thi reprint thei were not publish in
the preced edit of the book for a veri simpl reason at
the time when notredamedepari wa print the first time
the manuscript of these three chapter had been mislaid it wa
necessari to rewrit them or to dispens with them the author
consid that the onli two of these chapter which were in the
least import ow to their extent were chapter on art and
histori which in no wai interf with the groundwork of the
drama and the romanc that the public would not notic their
loss and that he the author would alon be in possess of
the secret he decid to omit them and then if the whole truth
must be confess hi indol shrunk from the task of
rewrit the three lost chapter he would have found it a
shorter matter to make a new romanc
now the chapter have been found and he avail himself of the
first opportun to restor them to their place
thi now is hi entir work such as he dream it such as he
made it good or bad durabl or fragil but such as he wish
it
these recov chapter will possess no doubt but littl valu
in the ey of person otherwis veri judici who have sought
in notredamedepari onli the drama the romanc but there
ar perchanc other reader who have not found it useless to
studi the sthetic and philosoph thought conceal in thi
book and who have taken pleasur while read
notredamedepari in unravel beneath the romanc
someth els than the romanc and in follow mai we be
pardon these rather ambiti express the system of the
historian and the aim of the artist through the creation of the
poet
for such peopl especi the chapter ad to thi edit
will complet notredamedepari if we admit that
notredamedepari wa worth the troubl of complet
in on of these chapter on the present decad of
architectur and on the death in hi mind almost inevit of
that king of art the author express and develop an opinion
unfortun well root in him and well thought out but he
feel it necessari to sai here that he earnestli desir that the
futur mai some dai put him in the wrong he know that art in
all it form ha everyth to hope from the new gener
whose geniu still in the germ can be heard gush forth in
our studio the grain is in the furrow the harvest will
certainli be fine he mere fear and the reason mai be seen in
the second volum of thi edit that the sap mai have been
withdrawn from that ancient soil of architectur which ha been
for so mani centuri the best field for art
nevertheless there ar todai in the artist youth so much
life power and so to speak predestin that in our
school of architectur in particular at the present time the
professor who ar detest produc not onli unconsci
but even in spite of themselv excel pupil quit the
revers of that potter mention by horac who dream amphor
and produc pot currit rota urcen exit
but in ani case whatev mai be the futur of architectur in
whatev manner our young architect mai on dai solv the
question of their art let us while wait for new monument
preserv the ancient monument let us if possibl inspir the
nation with a love for nation architectur that the author
declar is on of the princip aim of thi book it is on of
the princip aim of hi life
notredamedepari ha perhap open some true perspect
on the art of the middl ag on that marvel art which up to
the present time ha been unknown to some and what is wors
misknown by other but the author is far from regard as
accomplish the task which he ha voluntarili impos on
himself he ha alreadi plead on more than on occas the
caus of our ancient architectur he ha alreadi loudli
denounc mani profan mani demolit mani impieti he
will not grow weari he ha promis himself to recur frequent
to thi subject he will return to it he will be as
indefatig in defend our histor edific as our
iconoclast of the school and academi ar eager in attack
them for it is a grievou thing to see into what hand the
architectur of the middl ag ha fallen and in what a manner
the botcher of plaster of the present dai treat the ruin of thi
grand art it is even a shame for us intellig men who see them
at work and content ourselv with hoot them and we ar not
speak here mere of what goe on in the provinc but of
what is done in pari at our veri door beneath our window in
the great citi in the letter citi in the citi of the press
of word of thought we cannot resist the impuls to point out
in conclud thi note some of the act of vandal which ar
everi dai plan debat begun continu and successfulli
complet under the ey of the artist public of pari face to
face with critic which is disconcert by so much audac

poor tast no great harm is done but in a block with the
archiepiscop palac a bishop palac ha been demolish a
rare fragment of the fourteenth centuri which the demolish
architect could not distinguish from the rest he ha torn up the
