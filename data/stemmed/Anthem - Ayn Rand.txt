but our own and we know well that there is no transgress
blacker than to do or think alon we have broken the law the
law sai that men mai not write unless the council of vocat
bid them so mai we be forgiven
but thi is not the onli sin upon us we have commit a greater
crime and for thi crime there is no name what punish
await us if it be discov we know not for no such crime ha
come in the memori of men and there ar no law to provid for
it
it is dark here the flame of the candl stand still in the air
noth move in thi tunnel save our hand on the paper we ar
alon here under the earth it is a fear word alon the law
sai that none among men mai be alon ever and at ani time for
thi is the great transgress and the root of all evil but we
have broken mani law and now there is noth here save our on

from the larder of the home of the street sweeper we shall be
sentenc to ten year in the palac of correct detent if

our name is equal 72521 as it is written on the iron
bracelet which all men wear on their left wrist with their name
upon it we ar twentyon year old we ar six feet tall and
thi is a burden for there ar not mani men who ar six feet
tall ever have the teacher and the leader point to us and
frown and said
there is evil in your bone equal 72521 for your bodi ha
grown beyond the bodi of your brother but we cannot chang
our bone nor our bodi
we were born with a curs it ha alwai driven us to thought
which ar forbidden it ha alwai given us wish which men mai
not wish we know that we ar evil but there is no will in us
and no power to resist it thi is our wonder and our secret
fear that we know and do not resist
we strive to be like all our brother men for all men must be
alik over the portal of the palac of the world council there
ar word cut in the marbl which we repeat to ourselv
whenev we ar tempt
we ar on in all and all in on
there ar no men but onli the great we
on indivis and forev
we repeat thi to ourselv but it help us not
these word were cut long ago there is green mould in the
groov of the letter and yellow streak on the marbl which
come from more year than men could count and these word ar
the truth for thei ar written on the palac of the world
council and the world council is the bodi of all truth thu ha
it been ever sinc the great rebirth and farther back than that
no memori can reach
but we must never speak of the time befor the great rebirth
els we ar sentenc to three year in the palac of correct
detent it is onli the old on who whisper about it in the
even in the home of the useless thei whisper mani strang
thing of the tower which rose to the sky in those
unmention time and of the wagon which move without
hors and of the light which burn without flame but those
time were evil and those time pass awai when men saw the
great truth which is thi that all men ar on and that there is
no will save the will of all men togeth
all men ar good and wise it is onli we equal 72521 we
alon who were born with a curs for we ar not like our
brother and as we look back upon our life we see that it ha
ever been thu and that it ha brought us step by step to our
last suprem transgress our crime of crime hidden here
under the ground
we rememb the home of the infant where we live till we were
five year old togeth with all the children of the citi who
had been born in the same year the sleep hall there were
white and clean and bare of all thing save on hundr bed we
were just like all our brother then save for the on
transgress we fought with our brother there ar few
offens blacker than to fight with our brother at ani ag and
for ani caus whatsoev the council of the home told us so and
of all the children of that year we were lock in the cellar
most often
when we were five year old we were sent to the home of the
student where there ar ten ward for our ten year of
learn men must learn till thei reach their fifteenth year
then thei go to work in the home of the student we aros when
the big bell rang in the tower and we went to our bed when it
rang again befor we remov our garment we stood in the great
sleep hall and we rais our right arm and we said all
togeth with the three teacher at the head
we ar noth mankind is all by the grace of our brother ar
we allow our live we exist through by and for our brother
who ar the state amen
then we slept the sleep hall were white and clean and bare
of all thing save on hundr bed
we equal 72521 were not happi in those year in the home of
the student it wa not that the learn wa too hard for us
it wa that the learn wa too easi thi is a great sin to be
born with a head which is too quick it is not good to be
differ from our brother but it is evil to be superior to
them the teacher told us so and thei frown when thei look
upon us
so we fought against thi curs we tri to forget our lesson
but we alwai rememb we tri not to understand what the
teacher taught but we alwai understood it befor the teacher
had spoken we look upon union 53992 who were a pale boi with
onli half a brain and we tri to sai and do as thei did that
we might be like them like union 53992 but somehow the
teacher knew that we were not and we were lash more often
than all the other children
the teacher were just for thei had been appoint by the
council and the council ar the voic of all justic for thei
ar the voic of all men and if sometim in the secret
dark of our heart we regret that which befel us on our
fifteenth birthdai we know that it wa through our own guilt we
had broken a law for we had not paid heed to the word of our
teacher the teacher had said to us all
dare not choos in your mind the work you would like to do when
you leav the home of the student you shall do that which the
council of vocat shall prescrib for you for the council of
vocat know in it great wisdom where you ar need by your
brother men better than you can know it in your unworthi littl
mind and if you ar not need by your brother man there is no
reason for you to burden the earth with your bodi
we knew thi well in the year of our childhood but our curs
broke our will we were guilti and we confess it here we were
guilti of the great transgress of prefer we prefer
some work and some lesson to the other we did not listen well
to the histori of all the council elect sinc the great
rebirth but we love the scienc of thing we wish to know
we wish to know about all the thing which make the earth
around us we ask so mani question that the teacher forbad
it
we think that there ar mysteri in the sky and under the water
and in the plant which grow but the council of scholar ha
said that there ar no mysteri and the council of scholar
know all thing and we learn much from our teacher we
learn that the earth is flat and that the sun revolv around
it which caus the dai and the night we learn the name of
all the wind which blow over the sea and push the sail of our
great ship we learn how to bleed men to cure them of all
ailment
we love the scienc of thing and in the dark in the
secret hour when we awok in the night and there were no
brother around us but onli their shape in the bed and their
snore we close our ey and we held our lip shut and we
stop our breath that no shudder might let our brother see or
hear or guess and we thought that we wish to be sent to the
home of the scholar when our time would come
all the great modern invent come from the home of the
scholar such as the newest on which wa found onli a hundr
year ago of how to make candl from wax and string also how
to make glass which is put in our window to protect us from the
rain to find these thing the scholar must studi the earth and
learn from the river from the sand from the wind and the
rock and if we went to the home of the scholar we could learn
from these also we could ask question of these for thei do not
forbid question
and question give us no rest we know not why our curs make us
seek we know not what ever and ever but we cannot resist it it
whisper to us that there ar great thing on thi earth of our
and that we can know them if we try and that we must know them
we ask why must we know but it ha no answer to give us we
must know that we mai know
so we wish to be sent to the home of the scholar we wish it
so much that our hand trembl under the blanket in the night
and we bit our arm to stop that other pain which we could not
endur it wa evil and we dare not face our brother in the
morn for men mai wish noth for themselv and we were
punish when the council of vocat came to give us our life
mandat which tell those who reach their fifteenth year what
their work is to be for the rest of their dai
the council of vocat came on the first dai of spring and
thei sat in the great hall and we who were fifteen and all the
teacher came into the great hall and the council of vocat
sat on a high dai and thei had but two word to speak to each
of the student thei call the student name and when the
student step befor them on after anoth the council
said carpent or doctor or cook or leader then each
student rais their right arm and said the will of our
brother be done
now if the council ha said carpent or cook the student
so assign go to work and thei do not studi ani further but if
the council ha said leader then those student go into the
home of the leader which is the greatest hous in the citi for
it ha three stori and there thei studi for mani year so
that thei mai becom candid and be elect to the citi
council and the state council and the world councilbi a free and
gener vote of all men but we wish not to be a leader even
though it is a great honor we wish to be a scholar
so we await our turn in the great hall and then we heard the
council of vocat call our name equal 72521 we walk
to the dai and our leg did not trembl and we look up at
the council there were five member of the council three of the
male gender and two of the femal their hair wa white and their
face were crack as the clai of a dry river bed thei were old
thei seem older than the marbl of the templ of the world
council thei sat befor us and thei did not move and we saw no
breath to stir the fold of their white toga but we knew that
thei were aliv for a finger of the hand of the oldest rose
point to us and fell down again thi wa the onli thing which
move for the lip of the oldest did not move as thei said
street sweeper
we felt the cord of our neck grow tight as our head rose higher
to look upon the face of the council and we were happi we knew
we had been guilti but now we had a wai to aton for it we
would accept our life mandat and we would work for our
brother gladli and willingli and we would eras our sin
against them which thei did not know but we knew so we were
happi and proud of ourselv and of our victori over ourselv
we rais our right arm and we spoke and our voic wa the
clearest the steadiest voic in the hall that dai and we said
the will of our brother be done
and we look straight into the ey of the council but their
ey were as cold blue glass button
so we went into the home of the street sweeper it is a grei
hous on a narrow street there is a sundial in it courtyard by
which the council of the home can tell the hour of the dai and
when to ring the bell when the bell ring we all aris from our
bed the sky is green and cold in our window to the east the
shadow on the sundial mark off a halfhour while we dress and
eat our breakfast in the dine hall where there ar five long
tabl with twenti clai plate and twenti clai cup on each
tabl then we go to work in the street of the citi with our
broom and our rake in five hour when the sun is high we
return to the home and we eat our middai meal for which onehalf
hour is allow then we go to work again in five hour the
shadow ar blue on the pavement and the sky is blue with a
deep bright which is not bright we come back to have our

brotherhood and the hymn of equal and the hymn of the
collect spirit the sky is a soggi purpl when we return to
the home then the bell ring and we walk in a straight column to
the citi theatr for three hour of social recreat there a
plai is shown upon the stage with two great chorus from the
home of the actor which speak and answer all togeth in two
great voic the plai ar about toil and how good it is then
we walk back to the home in a straight column the sky is like a
black siev pierc by silver drop that trembl readi to burst
through the moth beat against the street lantern we go to our
bed and we sleep till the bell ring again the sleep hall
ar white and clean and bare of all thing save on hundr bed
thu have we live each dai of four year until two spring ago
when our crime happen thu must all men live until thei ar
forti at forti thei ar worn out at forti thei ar sent to
the home of the useless where the old on live the old on do
not work for the state take care of them thei sit in the sun
in summer and thei sit by the fire in winter thei do not speak
often for thei ar weari the old on know that thei ar soon
to die when a miracl happen and some live to be fortyf
thei ar the ancient on and the children stare at them when
pass by the home of the useless such is to be our life as
that of all our brother and of the brother who came befor us
such would have been our life had we not commit our crime
which chang all thing for us and it wa our curs which drove
us to our crime we had been a good street sweeper and like all
our brother street sweeper save for our curs wish to know we
look too long at the star at night and at the tree and the
earth and when we clean the yard of the home of the scholar
we gather the glass vial the piec of metal the dri bone
which thei had discard we wish to keep these thing and to
studi them but we had no place to hide them so we carri them
to the citi cesspool and then we made the discoveri
it wa on a dai of the spring befor last we street sweeper
work in brigad of three and we were with union 53992 thei of
the halfbrain and with intern 48818 now union 53992
ar a sickli lad and sometim thei ar stricken with
convuls when their mouth froth and their ey turn white
but intern 48818 ar differ thei ar a tall strong
youth and their ey ar like firefli for there is laughter in
their ey we cannot look upon intern 48818 and not
smile in answer for thi thei were not like in the home of the
student as it is not proper to smile without reason and also
thei were not like becaus thei took piec of coal and thei
drew pictur upon the wall and thei were pictur which made
men laugh but it is onli our brother in the home of the artist
who ar permit to draw pictur so intern 48818 were
sent to the home of the street sweeper like ourselv
intern 48818 and we ar friend thi is an evil thing to
sai for it is a transgress the great transgress of
prefer to love ani among men better than the other sinc
we must love all men and all men ar our friend so
intern 48818 and we have never spoken of it but we know
we know when we look into each other ey and when we look
thu without word we both know other thing also strang
thing for which there ar no word and these thing frighten
us
so on that dai of the spring befor last union 53992 were
stricken with convuls on the edg of the citi near the citi
theatr we left them to lie in the shade of the theatr tent and
we went with intern 48818 to finish our work we came
togeth to the great ravin behind the theatr it is empti save
for tree and weed beyond the ravin there is a plain and
beyond the plain there li the unchart forest about which men
must not think
we were gather the paper and the rag which the wind had
blown from the theatr when we saw an iron bar among the weed
it wa old and rust by mani rain we pull with all our
strength but we could not move it so we call intern
48818 and togeth we scrape the earth around the bar of a
sudden the earth fell in befor us and we saw an old iron grill
over a black hole
intern 48818 step back but we pull at the grill and
it gave wai and then we saw iron ring as step lead down a
shaft into a dark without bottom
we shall go down we said to intern 48818
it is forbidden thei answer
we said the council doe not know of thi hole so it cannot be
forbidden
and thei answer sinc the council doe not know of thi hole
there can be no law permit to enter it and everyth which
is not permit by law is forbidden
but we said we shall go none the less
thei were frighten but thei stood by and watch us go
we hung on the iron ring with our hand and our feet we could
see noth below us and abov us the hole open upon the sky
grew smaller and smaller till it came to be the size of a
button but still we went down then our foot touch the ground
we rub our ey for we could not see then our ey becam
us to the dark but we could not believ what we saw
no men known to us could have built thi place nor the men known
to our brother who live befor us and yet it wa built by men
it wa a great tunnel it wall were hard and smooth to the
touch it felt like stone but it wa not stone on the ground
there were long thin track of iron but it wa not iron it felt
smooth and cold as glass we knelt and we crawl forward our
hand grope along the iron line to see where it would lead but
there wa an unbroken night ahead onli the iron track glow
through it straight and white call us to follow but we
could not follow for we were lose the puddl of light behind
us so we turn and we crawl back our hand on the iron line
and our heart beat in our fingertip without reason and then we
knew
we knew suddenli that thi place wa left from the unmention
time so it wa true and those time had been and all the
wonder of those time hundr upon hundr of year ago men
knew secret which we have lost and we thought thi is a foul
place thei ar damn who touch the thing of the unmention
time but our hand which follow the track as we crawl
clung to the iron as if it would not leav it as if the skin of
our hand were thirsti and beg of the metal some secret fluid
beat in it cold
we return to the earth intern 48818 look upon us and
step back
equal 72521 thei said your face is white
but we could not speak and we stood look upon them
thei back awai as if thei dare not touch us then thei
smile but it wa not a gai smile it wa lost and plead but
still we could not speak then thei said
we shall report our find to the citi council and both of us will
be reward
and then we spoke our voic wa hard and there wa no merci in
our voic we said
we shall not report our find to the citi council we shall not
report it to ani men
thei rais their hand to their ear for never had thei heard
such word as these
intern 48818 we ask will you report us to the
council and see us lash to death befor your ey
thei stood straight all of a sudden and thei answer rather
would we die
then we said keep silent thi place is our thi place
belong to us equal 72521 and to no other men on earth and
if ever we surrend it we shall surrend our life with it
also
then we saw that the ey of intern 48818 were full to
the lid with tear thei dare not drop thei whisper and
their voic trembl so that their word lost all shape
the will of the council is abov all thing for it is the will
of our brother which is holi but if you wish it so we shall
obei you rather shall we be evil with you than good with all our
brother mai the council have merci upon both our heart
then we walk awai togeth and back to the home of the street
sweeper and we walk in silenc
thu did it come to pass that each night when the star ar high
and the street sweeper sit in the citi theatr we equal
72521 steal out and run through the dark to our place it
is easi to leav the theatr when the candl ar blown out and
the actor come onto the stage no ey can see us as we crawl
under our seat and under the cloth of the tent later it is easi
to steal through the shadow and fall in line next to
intern 48818 as the column leav the theatr it is
dark in the street and there ar no men about for no men mai
walk through the citi when thei have no mission to walk there
each night we run to the ravin and we remov the stone which
we have pile upon the iron grill to hide it from the men each
night for three hour we ar under the earth alon
we have stolen candl from the home of the street sweeper we
have stolen flint and knive and paper and we have brought them
to thi place we have stolen glass vial and powder and acid
from the home of the scholar now we sit in the tunnel for three
hour each night and we studi we melt strang metal and we mix
acid and we cut open the bodi of the anim which we find in
the citi cesspool we have built an oven of the brick we
gather in the street we burn the wood we find in the ravin
the fire flicker in the oven and blue shadow danc upon the
wall and there is no sound of men to disturb us
we have stolen manuscript thi is a great offens manuscript
ar preciou for our brother in the home of the clerk spend
on year to copi on singl script in their clear handwrit
manuscript ar rare and thei ar kept in the home of the
scholar so we sit under the earth and we read the stolen
script two year have pass sinc we found thi place and in
these two year we have learn more than we had learn in the
ten year of the home of the student
we have learn thing which ar not in the script we have
solv secret of which the scholar have no knowledg we have
come to see how great is the unexplor and mani lifetim will
not bring us to the end of our quest but we wish no end to our
quest we wish noth save to be alon and to learn and to
feel as if with each dai our sight were grow sharper than the
hawk and clearer than rock crystal
strang ar the wai of evil we ar fals in the face of our
brother we ar defi the will of our council we alon of
the thousand who walk thi earth we alon in thi hour ar
do a work which ha no purpos save that we wish to do it the
evil of our crime is not for the human mind to probe the natur
of our punish if it be discov is not for the human
heart to ponder never not in the memori of the ancient on
ancient never have men done that which we ar do
and yet there is no shame in us and no regret we sai to
ourselv that we ar a wretch and a traitor but we feel no
burden upon our spirit and no fear in our heart and it seem to
us that our spirit is clear as a lake troubl by no ey save
those of the sun and in our heartstrang ar the wai of
evilin our heart there is the first peac we have known in
twenti year
part two
liberti 53000 liberti fivethre thousand liberti
53000
we wish to write thi name we wish to speak it but we dare not
speak it abov a whisper for men ar forbidden to take notic of
women and women ar forbidden to take notic of men but we
think of on among women thei whose name is liberti 53000 and
we think of no other the women who have been assign to work
the soil live in the home of the peasant beyond the citi where
the citi end there is a great road wind off to the north and
we street sweeper must keep thi road clean to the first
milepost there is a hedg along the road and beyond the hedg
lie the field the field ar black and plough and thei lie
like a great fan befor us with their furrow gather in some
hand beyond the sky spread forth from that hand open wide
apart as thei come toward us like black pleat that sparkl with
thin green spangl women work in the field and their white
tunic in the wind ar like the wing of seagul beat over
the black soil
and there it wa that we saw liberti 53000 walk along the
furrow their bodi wa straight and thin as a blade of iron
their ey were dark and hard and glow with no fear in them
no kind and no guilt their hair wa golden as the sun their
hair flew in the wind shine and wild as if it defi men to
restrain it thei threw seed from their hand as if thei deign
to fling a scorn gift and the earth wa a beggar under their
feet
we stood still for the first time did we know fear and then
pain and we stood still that we might not spill thi pain more
preciou than pleasur
then we heard a voic from the other call their name liberti
53000 and thei turn and walk back thu we learn their
name and we stood watch them go till their white tunic wa
lost in the blue mist
and the follow dai as we came to the northern road we kept
our ey upon liberti 53000 in the field and each dai
thereaft we knew the ill of wait for our hour on the
northern road and there we look at liberti 53000 each dai we
know not whether thei look at us also but we think thei did
then on dai thei came close to the hedg and suddenli thei
turn to us thei turn in a whirl and the movement of their
bodi stop as if slash off as suddenli as it had start
thei stood still as a stone and thei look straight upon us
straight into our ey there wa no smile on their face and no
welcom but their face wa taut and their ey were dark then
thei turn as swiftli and thei walk awai from us
but the follow dai when we came to the road thei smile
thei smile to us and for us and we smile in answer their head
fell back and their arm fell as if their arm and their thin
white neck were stricken suddenli with a great lassitud thei
were not look upon us but upon the sky then thei glanc at
us over their shoulder as we felt as if a hand had touch our
bodi slip softli from our lip to our feet
everi morn thereaft we greet each other with our ey we
dare not speak it is a transgress to speak to men of other
trade save in group at the social meet but onc stand
at the hedg we rais our hand to our forehead and then move
it slowli palm down toward liberti 53000 had the other seen
it thei could have guess noth for it look onli as if we
were shade our ey from the sun but liberti 53000 saw it and
understood thei rais their hand to their forehead and move it
as we had thu each dai we greet liberti 53000 and thei
answer and no men can suspect
we do not wonder at thi new sin of our it is our second
transgress of prefer for we do not think of all our
brother as we must but onli of on and their name is liberti
53000 we do not know why we think of them we do not know why
when we think of them we feel all of a sudden that the earth is
good and that it is not a burden to live we do not think of them
as liberti 53000 ani longer we have given them a name in our
thought we call them the golden on but it is a sin to give
men name which distinguish them from other men yet we call them
the golden on for thei ar not like the other the golden on
ar not like the other
and we take no heed of the law which sai that men mai not think
of women save at the time of mate thi is the time each
spring when all the men older than twenti and all the women older
than eighteen ar sent for on night to the citi palac of
mate and each of the men have on of the women assign to
them by the council of eugen children ar born each winter
but women never see their children and children never know their
parent twice have we been sent to the palac of mate but it
is an ugli and shame matter of which we do not like to think
we had broken so mani law and todai we have broken on more
todai we spoke to the golden on
the other women were far off in the field when we stop at the
hedg by the side of the road the golden on were kneel alon
at the moat which run through the field and the drop of water
fall from their hand as thei rais the water to their lip
were like spark of fire in the sun then the golden on saw us
and thei did not move kneel there look at us and circl
of light plai upon their white tunic from the sun on the water
of the moat and on sparkl drop fell from a finger of their
hand held as frozen in the air
then the golden on rose and walk to the hedg as if thei had
heard a command in our ey the two other street sweeper of our
brigad were a hundr pace awai down the road and we thought
that intern 48818 would not betrai us and union 53992
would not understand so we look straight upon the golden on
and we saw the shadow of their lash on their white cheek and
the spark of sun on their lip and we said
you ar beauti liberti 53000
their face did not move and thei did not avert their ey onli
their ey grew wider and there wa triumph in their ey and
it wa not triumph over us but over thing we could not guess
then thei ask
what is your name
equal 72521 we answer
you ar not on of our brother equal 72521 for we do not
wish you to be
we cannot sai what thei meant for there ar no word for their
mean but we know it without word and we knew it then
no we answer nor ar you on of our sister
if you see us among score of women will you look upon us
we shall look upon you liberti 53000 if we see you among all
the women of the earth
then thei ask
ar street sweeper sent to differ part of the citi or do
thei alwai work in the same place
thei alwai work in the same place we answer and no on
will take thi road awai from us
your ey thei said ar not like the ey of ani among men
and suddenli without caus for the thought which came to us we
felt cold cold to our stomach
how old ar you we ask
thei understood our thought for thei lower their ey for the
first time
seventeen thei whisper
and we sigh as if a burden had been taken from us for we had
been think without reason of the palac of mate and we
thought that we would not let the golden on be sent to the
palac how to prevent it how to bar the will of the council
we knew not but we knew suddenli that we would onli we do not
know why such thought came to us for these ugli matter bear no
relat to us and the golden on what relat can thei bear
still without reason as we stood there by the hedg we felt
our lip drawn tight with hatr a sudden hatr for all our
brother men and the golden on saw it and smile slowli and
there wa in their smile the first sad we had seen in them
we think that in the wisdom of women the golden on had
understood more than we can understand
then three of the sister in the field appear come toward
the road so the golden on walk awai from us thei took the
bag of seed and thei threw the seed into the furrow of earth
as thei walk awai but the seed flew wildli for the hand of
the golden on wa trembl
yet as we walk back to the home of the street sweeper we felt
that we want to sing without reason so we were reprimand
tonight in the dine hall for without know it we had begun
to sing aloud some tune we had never heard but it is not proper
to sing without reason save at the social meet
we ar sing becaus we ar happi we answer the on of the
home council who reprimand us
inde you ar happi thei answer how els can men be when
thei live for their brother
and now sit here in our tunnel we wonder about these word
it is forbidden not to be happi for as it ha been explain
to us men ar free and the earth belong to them and all thing
on earth belong to all men and the will of all men togeth is
good for all and so all men must be happi
yet as we stand at night in the great hall remov our garment
for sleep we look upon our brother and we wonder the head of
our brother ar bow the ey of our brother ar dull and
never do thei look on anoth in the ey the shoulder of our
brother ar hunch and their muscl ar drawn as if their
bodi were shrink and wish to shrink out of sight and a
word steal into our mind as we look upon our brother and that
word is fear
there is fear hang in the air of the sleep hall and in
the air of the street fear walk through the citi fear without
name without shape all men feel it and none dare to speak
we feel it also when we ar in the home of the street sweeper
but here in our tunnel we feel it no longer the air is pure
under the ground there is no odor of men and these three hour
give us strength for our hour abov the ground
our bodi is betrai us for the council of the home look with
suspicion upon us it is not good to feel too much joi nor to be
glad that our bodi live for we matter not and it must not
matter to us whether we live or die which is to be as our
brother will it but we equal 72521 ar glad to be live
if thi is a vice then we wish no virtu
yet our brother ar not like us all is not well with our
brother there ar fratern 25503 a quiet boi with wise
kind ey who cry suddenli without reason in the midst of dai
or night and their bodi shake with sob thei cannot explain
there ar solidar 96347 who ar a bright youth without fear
in the dai but thei scream in their sleep and thei scream
help us help us help us into the night in a voic which
chill our bone but the doctor cannot cure solidar 96347
and as we all undress at night in the dim light of the candl
our brother ar silent for thei dare not speak the thought of
their mind for all must agre with all and thei cannot know if
their thought ar the thought of all and so thei fear to
speak and thei ar glad when the candl ar blown for the
night but we equal 72521 look through the window upon the
sky and there is peac in the sky and cleanli and digniti
and beyond the citi there li the plain and beyond the plain
black upon the black sky there li the unchart forest
we do not wish to look upon the unchart forest we do not wish
to think of it but ever do our ey return to that black patch
upon the sky men never enter the unchart forest for there is
no power to explor it and no path to lead among it ancient
tree which stand as guard of fear secret it is whisper
that onc or twice in a hundr year on among the men of the
citi escap alon and run to the unchart forest without call
or reason these men do not return thei perish from hunger and
from the claw of the wild beast which roam the forest but our
council sai that thi is onli a legend we have heard that there
ar mani unchart forest over the land among the citi and
it is whisper that thei have grown over the ruin of mani
citi of the unmention time the tree have swallow the
ruin and the bone under the ruin and all the thing which
perish and as we look upon the unchart forest far in the
night we think of the secret of the unmention time and we
wonder how it came to pass that these secret were lost to the
world we have heard the legend of the great fight in which
mani men fought on on side and onli a few on the other these
few were the evil on and thei were conquer then great fire
rage over the land and in these fire the evil on and all the
thing made by the evil on were burn and the fire which is
call the dawn of the great rebirth wa the script fire where
all the script of the evil on were burn and with them all
the word of the evil on great mountain of flame stood in the
squar of the citi for three month then came the great
rebirth
the word of the evil on the word of the unmention
time what ar the word which we have lost
mai the council have merci upon us we had no wish to write such
a question and we knew not what we were do till we had
written it we shall not ask thi question and we shall not think
it we shall not call death upon our head
and yet and yet there is some word on singl word which
is not in the languag of men but which had been and thi is
the unspeak word which no men mai speak nor hear but
sometim and it is rare sometim somewher on among men
find that word thei find it upon scrap of old manuscript or
cut into the fragment of ancient stone but when thei speak it
thei ar put to death there is no crime punish by death in
thi world save thi on crime of speak the unspeak word
we have seen on of such men burn aliv in the squar of the
citi and it wa a sight which ha stai with us through the
year and it haunt us and follow us and it give us no rest
we were a child then ten year old and we stood in the great
squar with all the children and all the men of the citi sent to
behold the burn thei brought the transgressor out into the
squar and thei led them to the pyre thei had torn out the
tongu of the transgressor so that thei could speak no longer
the transgressor were young and tall thei had hair of gold and
ey blue as morn thei walk to the pyre and their step did
not falter and of all the face on that squar of all the face
which shriek and scream and spat curs upon them their wa
the calmest and the happiest face
as the chain were wound over their bodi at the stake and a
flame set to the pyre the transgressor look upon the citi
there wa a thin thread of blood run from the corner of their
mouth but their lip were smile and a monstrou thought came
to us then which ha never left us we had heard of saint
there ar the saint of labor and the saint of the council
and the saint of the great rebirth but we had never seen a
saint nor what the like of a saint should be and we thought
then stand in the squar that the like of a saint wa
the face we saw befor us in the flame the face of the
transgressor of the unspeak word
as the flame rose a thing happen which no ey saw but our
els we would not be live todai perhap it had onli seem to
us but it seem to us that the ey of the transgressor had
chosen us from the crowd and were look straight upon us there
wa no pain in their ey and no knowledg of the agoni of their
bodi there wa onli joi in them and pride a pride holier than
is fit for human pride to be and it seem as if these ey were
try to tell us someth through the flame to send into our
ey some word without sound and it seem as if these ey were
beg us to gather that word and not to let it go from us and
from the earth but the flame rose and we could not guess the
word
whateven if we have to burn for it like the saint of the
pyrewhat is the unspeak word
part three
we equal 72521 have discov a new power of natur and
we have discov it alon and we alon ar to know it
it is said now let us be lash for it if we must the council
of scholar ha said that we all know the thing which exist and
therefor the thing which ar not known by all do not exist but
we think that the council of scholar is blind the secret of
thi earth ar not for all men to see but onli for those who
will seek them we know for we have found a secret unknown to
all our brother
we know not what thi power is nor whenc it come but we know
it natur we have watch it and work with it we saw it
first two year ago on night we were cut open the bodi of
a dead frog when we saw it leg jerk it wa dead yet it
move some power unknown to men wa make it move we could not
understand it then after mani test we found the answer the
frog had been hang on a wire of copper and it had been the
metal of our knife which had sent the strang power to the copper
through the brine of the frog bodi we put a piec of copper
and a piec of zinc into a jar of brine we touch a wire to
them and there under our finger wa a miracl which had never
occur befor a new miracl and a new power
thi discoveri haunt us we follow it in prefer to all
our studi we work with it we test it in more wai than we
can describ and each step wa as anoth miracl unveil
befor us we came to know that we had found the greatest power
on earth for it defi all the law known to men it make the
needl move and turn on the compass which we stole from the home
of the scholar but we had been taught when still a child that
the loadston point to the north and that thi is a law which
noth can chang yet our new power defi all law we found
that it caus lightn and never have men known what caus
lightn in thunderstorm we rais a tall rod of iron by the
side of our hole and we watch it from below we have seen the
lightn strike it again and again and now we know that metal
draw the power of the sky and that metal can be made to give it
forth
we have built strang thing with thi discoveri of our we us
for it the copper wire which we found here under the ground we
have walk the length of our tunnel with a candl light the
wai we could go no farther than half a mile for earth and rock
had fallen at both end but we gather all the thing we found
and we brought them to our work place we found strang box
with bar of metal insid with mani cord and strand and coil
of metal we found wire that led to strang littl globe of
glass on the wall thei contain thread of metal thinner than
a spider web
these thing help us in our work we do not understand them but
we think that the men of the unmention time had known our
power of the sky and these thing had some relat to it we do
not know but we shall learn we cannot stop now even though it
frighten us that we ar alon in our knowledg
no singl on can possess greater wisdom than the mani scholar
who ar elect by all men for their wisdom yet we can we do
we have fought against sai it but now it is said we do not
care we forget all men all law and all thing save our metal
and our wire so much is still to be learn so long a road
li befor us and what care we if we must travel it alon
part four
mani dai pass befor we could speak to the golden on again
but then came the dai when the sky turn white as if the sun
had burst and spread it flame in the air and the field lai
still without breath and the dust of the road wa white in the
glow so the women of the field were weari and thei tarri over
their work and thei were far from the road when we came but the
golden on stood alon at the hedg wait we stop and we
saw that their ey so hard and scorn to the world were
look at us as if thei would obei ani word we might speak
and we said
we have given you a name in our thought liberti 53000
what is our name thei ask
the golden on
nor do we call you equal 72521 when we think of you
what name have you given us thei look straight into our ey
and thei held their head high and thei answer
the unconqu
for a long time we could not speak then we said
such thought as these ar forbidden golden on
but you think such thought as these and you wish us to think
them
we look into their ey and we could not lie
ye we whisper and thei smile and then we said our
dearest on do not obei us
thei step back and their ey were wide and still
speak these word again thei whisper
which word we ask but thei did not answer and we knew it
our dearest on we whisper
never have men said thi to women
the head of the golden on bow slowli and thei stood still
befor us their arm at their side the palm of their hand
turn to us as if their bodi were deliv in submiss to
our ey and we could not speak
then thei rais their head and thei spoke simpli and gentli as
if thei wish us to forget some anxieti of their own
the dai is hot thei said and you have work for mani hour
and you must be weari
no we answer
it is cooler in the field thei said and there is water to
drink ar you thirsti
ye we answer but we cannot cross the hedg
we shall bring the water to you thei said
then thei knelt by the moat thei gather water in their two
hand thei rose and thei held the water out to our lip
we do not know if we drank that water we onli knew suddenli that
their hand were empti but we were still hold our lip to
their hand and that thei knew it but did not move
we rais our head and step back for we did not understand
what had made us do thi and we were afraid to understand it
and the golden on step back and stood look upon their
hand in wonder then the golden on move awai even though no
other were come and thei move step back as if thei
could not turn from us their arm bent befor them as if thei
could not lower their hand
part five
we made it we creat it we brought it forth from the night of
the ag we alon our hand our mind our alon and onli
we know not what we ar sai our head is reel we look upon
the light which we have made we shall be forgiven for anyth
we sai tonight
tonight after more dai and trial than we can count we
finish build a strang thing from the remain of the
unmention time a box of glass devis to give forth the
power of the sky of greater strength than we had ever achiev
befor and when we put our wire to thi box when we close the
currentth wire glow it came to life it turn red and a
circl of light lai on the stone befor us
we stood and we held our head in our hand we could not
conceiv of that which we had creat we had touch no flint
made no fire yet here wa light light that came from nowher
light from the heart of metal
we blew out the candl dark swallow us there wa noth
left around us noth save night and a thin thread of flame in
it as a crack in the wall of a prison we stretch our hand to
the wire and we saw our finger in the red glow we could not
see our bodi nor feel it and in that moment noth exist save
our two hand over a wire glow in a black abyss
then we thought of the mean of that which lai befor us we
can light our tunnel and the citi and all the citi of the
world with noth save metal and wire we can give our brother
a new light cleaner and brighter than ani thei have ever known
the power of the sky can be made to do men bid there ar
no limit to it secret and it might and it can be made to
grant us anyth if we but choos to ask
then we knew what we must do our discoveri is too great for us
to wast our time in sweep the street we must not keep our
secret to ourselv nor buri under the ground we must bring
it into the sight of all men we need all our time we need the
work room of the home of the scholar we want the help of our
brother scholar and their wisdom join to our there is so
much work ahead for all of us for all the scholar of the world
in a month the world council of scholar is to meet in our citi
it is a great council to which the wisest of all land ar
elect and it meet onc a year in the differ citi of the
earth we shall go to thi council and we shall lai befor them
as our gift thi glass box with the power of the sky we shall
confess everyth to them thei will see understand and
forgiv for our gift is greater than our transgress thei
will explain it to the council of vocat and we shall be
assign to the home of the scholar thi ha never been done
befor but neither ha a gift such as our ever been offer to
men
we must wait we must guard our tunnel as we had never guard it
befor for should ani men save the scholar learn of our secret
thei would not understand it nor would thei believ us thei
would see noth save our crime of work alon and thei
would destroi us and our light we care not about our bodi but
our light is
ye we do care for the first time do we care about our bodi
for thi wire is as a part of our bodi as a vein torn from us
glow with our blood ar we proud of thi thread of metal or
of our hand which made it or is there a line to divid these
two
we stretch out our arm for the first time do we know how strong
our arm ar and a strang thought come to us we wonder for
the first time in our life what we look like men never see
their own face and never ask their brother about it for it is
evil to have concern for their own face or bodi but tonight
for a reason we cannot fathom we wish it were possibl to us to
know the like of our own person
part six
we have not written for thirti dai for thirti dai we have not
been here in our tunnel we had been caught it happen on that
night when we wrote last we forgot that night to watch the
sand in the glass which tell us when three hour have pass and
it is time to return to the citi theatr when we rememb it
the sand had run out
we hasten to the theatr but the big tent stood grei and
silent against the sky the street of the citi lai befor us
dark and empti if we went back to hide in our tunnel we would
be found and our light found with us so we walk to the home of
the street sweeper
when the council of the home question us we look upon the
face of the council but there wa no curios in those face
and no anger and no merci so when the oldest of them ask us
where have you been we thought of our glass box and of our
light and we forgot all els and we answer
we will not tell you
the oldest did not question us further thei turn to the two
youngest and said and their voic wa bore
take our brother equal 72521 to the palac of correct
detent lash them until thei tell
so we were taken to the stone room under the palac of correct
detent thi room ha no window and it is empti save for an
iron post two men stood by the post nake but for leather
apron and leather hood over their face those who had brought
us depart leav us to the two judg who stood in a corner
of the room the judg were small thin men grei and bent thei
gave the signal to the two strong hood on
thei tore the cloth from our bodi thei threw us down upon our
knee and thei ti our hand to the iron post the first blow of
the lash felt as if our spine had been cut in two the second
blow stop the first and for a second we felt noth then
the pain struck us in our throat and fire ran in our lung
without air but we did not cry out
the lash whistl like a sing wind we tri to count the
blow but we lost count we knew that the blow were fall
upon our back onli we felt noth upon our back ani longer a
flame grill kept danc befor our ey and we thought of
noth save that grill a grill a grill of red squar and
then we knew that we were look at the squar of the iron
grill in the door and there were also the squar of stone on
the wall and the squar which the lash wa cut upon our
back cross and recross itself in our flesh
then we saw a fist befor us it knock our chin up and we saw
the red froth of our mouth on the wither finger and the judg
ask
where have you been
but we jerk our head awai hid our face upon our ti hand
and bit our lip
the lash whistl again we wonder who wa sprinkl burn
coal dust upon the floor for we saw drop of red twinkl on
the stone around us
then we knew noth save two voic snarl steadili on
after the other even though we knew thei were speak mani
minut apart
where have you been where have you been where have you been
where have you been
and our lip move but the sound trickl back into our throat
and the sound wa onli
the light the light the light
then we knew noth
we open our ey ly on our stomach on the brick floor of a
cell we look upon two hand ly far befor us on the brick
and we move them and we knew that thei were our hand but we
could not move our bodi then we smile for we thought of the
light and that we had not betrai it
we lai in our cell for mani dai the door open twice each dai
onc for the men who brought us bread and water and onc for the
judg mani judg came to our cell first the humblest and then
the most honor judg of the citi thei stood befor us in
their white toga and thei ask
ar you readi to speak
but we shook our head ly befor them on the floor and thei
depart
we count each dai and each night as it pass then tonight
we knew that we must escap for tomorrow the world council of
scholar is to meet in our citi
it wa easi to escap from the palac of correct detent
the lock ar old on the door and there ar no guard about
there is no reason to have guard for men have never defi the
council so far as to escap from whatev place thei were
order to be our bodi is healthi and strength return to it
speedili we lung against the door and it gave wai we stole
through the dark passag and through the dark street and down
into our tunnel
we lit the candl and we saw that our place had not been found
and noth had been touch and our glass box stood befor us
on the cold oven as we had left it what matter thei now the
scar upon our back
tomorrow in the full light of dai we shall take our box and
leav our tunnel open and walk through the street to the home

part seven
it is dark here in the forest the leav rustl over our head
black against the last gold of the sky the moss is soft and
warm we shall sleep on thi moss for mani night till the
beast of the forest come to tear our bodi we have no bed now
save the moss and no futur save the beast
we ar old now yet we were young thi morn when we carri
our glass box through the street of the citi to the home of the
scholar no men stop us for there were none about from the
palac of correct detent and the other knew noth no
men stop us at the gate we walk through empti passag and
into the great hall where the world council of scholar sat in
solemn meet
we saw noth as we enter save the sky in the great window
blue and glow then we saw the scholar who sat around a long
tabl thei were as shapeless cloud huddl at the rise of the
great sky there were men whose famou name we knew and other
from distant land whose name we had not heard we saw a great
paint on the wall over their head of the twenti illustri
men who had invent the candl
all the head of the council turn to us as we enter these
great and wise of the earth did not know what to think of us and
thei look upon us with wonder and curios as if we were a
miracl it is true that our tunic wa torn and stain with
brown stain which had been blood we rais our right arm and we
said
our greet to you our honor brother of the world council
of scholar
then collect 00009 the oldest and wisest of the council
spoke and ask
who ar you our brother for you do not look like a scholar
our name is equal 72521 we answer and we ar a street
sweeper of thi citi
then it wa as if a great wind had stricken the hall for all the
scholar spoke at onc and thei were angri and frighten
a street sweeper a street sweeper walk in upon the world
council of scholar it is not to be believ it is against all
the rule and all the law
but we knew how to stop them
our brother we said we matter not nor our transgress
it is onli our brother men who matter give no thought to us for
we ar noth but listen to our word for we bring you a gift
such as had never been brought to men listen to us for we hold
the futur of mankind in our hand
then thei listen
we place our glass box upon the tabl befor them we spoke of
it and of our long quest and of our tunnel and of our escap
from the palac of correct detent not a hand move in that
hall as we spoke nor an ey then we put the wire to the box
and thei all bent forward and sat still watch and we stood
still our ey upon the wire and slowli slowli as a flush of
blood a red flame trembl in the wire then the wire glow
but terror struck the men of the council thei leapt to their
feet thei ran from the tabl and thei stood press against the
wall huddl togeth seek the warmth of on anoth
bodi to give them courag
we look upon them and we laugh and said
fear noth our brother there is a great power in these
wire but thi power is tame it is your we give it to you
still thei would not move
we give you the power of the sky we cri we give you the
kei to the earth take it and let us be on of you the humblest
among you let us all work togeth and har thi power and
make it eas the toil of men let us throw awai our candl and
our torch let us flood our citi with light let us bring a
new light to men
but thei look upon us and suddenli we were afraid for their
ey were still and small and evil
our brother we cri have you noth to sai to us
then collect 00009 move forward thei move to the tabl and
the other follow
ye spoke collect 00009 we have much to sai to you
the sound of their voic brought silenc to the hall and to beat
of our heart
ye said collect 00009 we have much to sai to a wretch
who have broken all the law and who boast of their infami
how dare you think that your mind held greater wisdom than the
mind of your brother and if the council had decre that you
should be a street sweeper how dare you think that you could be
of greater us to men than in sweep the street
how dare you gutter cleaner spoke fratern 93452 to
hold yourself as on alon and with the thought of the on and
not of the mani
you shall be burn at the stake said democraci 46998
no thei shall be lash said unanim 73304 till there is
noth left under the lash
no said collect 00009 we cannot decid upon thi our
brother no such crime ha ever been commit and it is not
for us to judg nor for ani small council we shall deliv thi
creatur to the world council itself and let their will be done
we look upon them and we plead
our brother you ar right let the will of the council be done
upon our bodi we do not care but the light what will you do
with the light
collect 00009 look upon us and thei smile
so you think that you have found a new power said collect
00009 do all your brother think that
no we answer
what is not thought by all men cannot be true said collect
00009
you have work on thi alon ask intern 15537
mani men in the home of the scholar have had strang new idea
in the past said solidar 81164 but when the major of
their brother scholar vote against them thei abandon their
idea as all men must
thi box is useless said allianc 67349
should it be what thei claim of it said harmoni 92642 then
it would bring ruin to the depart of candl the candl is a
great boon to mankind as approv by all men therefor it
cannot be destroi by the whim of on
thi would wreck the plan of the world council said unanim
29913 and without the plan of the world council the sun
cannot rise it took fifti year to secur the approv of all
the council for the candl and to decid upon the number
need and to refit the plan so as to make candl instead of
torch thi touch upon thousand and thousand of men work
in score of state we cannot alter the plan again so soon
and if thi should lighten the toil of men said similar
50306 then it is a great evil for men have no caus to exist
save in toil for other men
then collect 00009 rose and point at our box
thi thing thei said must be destroi
and all the other cri as on
it must be destroi
then we leapt to the tabl
we seiz our box we shove them asid and we ran to the
window we turn and we look at them for the last time and a
rage such as it is not fit for human to know choke our voic
in our throat
you fool we cri you fool you thricedamn fool
we swung our fist through the windowpan and we leapt out in a
ring rain of glass
we fell but we never let the box fall from our hand then we
ran we ran blindli and men and hous streak past us in a
torrent without shape and the road seem not to be flat befor
us but as if it were leap up to meet us and we wait for
the earth to rise and strike us in the face but we ran we knew
not where we were go we knew onli that we must run run to
the end of the world to the end of our dai
then we knew suddenli that we were ly on a soft earth and that
we had stop tree taller than we had ever seen befor stood
over us in great silenc then we knew we were in the unchart
forest we had not thought of come here but our leg had
carri our wisdom and our leg had brought us to the unchart
forest against our will
our glass box lai besid us we crawl to it we fell upon it
our face in our arm and we lai still
we lai thu for a long time then we rose we took our box and
walk on into the forest
it matter not where we went we knew that men would not follow
us for thei never enter the unchart forest we had noth to
fear from them the forest dispos of it own victim thi gave
us no fear either onli we wish to be awai awai from the citi
and from the air that touch upon the air of the citi so we
walk on our box in our arm our heart empti
we ar doom whatev dai ar left to us we shall spend them
alon and we have heard of the corrupt to be found in
solitud we have torn ourselv from the truth which is our
brother men and there is no road back for us and no redempt
we know these thing but we do not care we care for noth on
earth we ar tire
onli the glass box in our arm is like a live heart that give
us strength we have li to ourselv we have not built thi
box for the good of our brother we built it for it own sake
it is abov all our brother to us and it truth abov their
truth why wonder about thi we have not mani dai to live we
ar walk to the fang await us somewher among the great
silent tree there is not a thing behind us to regret
then a blow of pain struck us our first and our onli we thought
of the golden on we thought of the golden on whom we shall
never see again then the pain pass it is best we ar on of
the damn it is best if the golden on forget our name and the
bodi which bore that name
part eight
it ha been a dai of wonder thi our first dai in the forest
we awok when a rai of sunlight fell across our face we want
to leap to our feet as we have had to leap everi morn of our
life but we rememb suddenli that no bell had rung and that
there wa no bell to ring anywher we lai on our back we threw
our arm out and we look up at the sky the leav had edg
of silver that trembl and rippl like a river of green and
fire flow high abov us
we did not wish to move we thought suddenli that we could lie
thu as long as we wish and we laugh aloud at the thought
we could also rise or run or leap or fall down again we were
think that these were thought without sens but befor we
knew it our bodi had risen in on leap our arm stretch out of
their own will and our bodi whirl and whirl till it rais
a wind to rustl through the leav of the bush then our hand
seiz a branch and swung us high into a tree with no aim save
the wonder of learn the strength of our bodi the branch
snap under us and we fell upon the moss that wa soft as a
cushion then our bodi lose all sens roll over and over on
the moss dry leav in our tunic in our hair in our face and
we heard suddenli that we were laugh laugh aloud laugh
as if there were no power left in us save laughter
then we took our glass box and we went on into the forest we
went on cut through the branch and it wa as if we were
swim through a sea of leav with the bush as wave rise
and fall and rise around us and fling their green sprai
high to the treetop the tree part befor us call us
forward the forest seem to welcom us we went on without
thought without care with noth to feel save the song of our
bodi
we stop when we felt hunger we saw bird in the tree
branch and fly from under our footstep we pick a stone
and we sent it as an arrow at a bird it fell befor us we made
a fire we cook the bird and we at it and no meal had ever
tast better to us and we thought suddenli that there wa a
great satisfact to be found in the food which we need and
obtain by our own hand and we wish to be hungri again and
soon that we might know again thi strang new pride in eat
then we walk on and we came to a stream which lai as a streak
of glass among the tree it lai so still that we saw no water
but onli a cut in the earth in which the tree grew down
upturn and the sky lai at the bottom we knelt by the stream
and we bent down to drink and then we stop for upon the
blue of the sky below us we saw our own face for the first time
we sat still and we held our breath for our face and our bodi
were beauti our face wa not like the face of our brother
for we felt not piti when look upon it our bodi wa not like
the bodi of our brother for our limb were straight and thin
and hard and strong and we thought that we could trust thi
be who look upon us from the stream and that we had noth
to fear with thi be
we walk on till the sun had set when the shadow gather
among the tree we stop in a hollow between the root where
we shall sleep tonight and suddenli for the first time thi
dai we rememb that we ar the damn we rememb it and
we laugh
we ar write thi on the paper we had hidden in our tunic
togeth with the written page we had brought for the world
council of scholar but never given to them we have much to
speak of to ourselv and we hope we shall find the word for it
in the dai to come now we cannot speak for we cannot
understand
part nine
we have not written for mani dai we did not wish to speak for
we need no word to rememb that which ha happen to us
it wa on our second dai in the forest that we heard step behind
us we hid in the bush and we wait the step came closer
and then we saw the fold of a white tunic among the tree and a
gleam of gold
we leapt forward we ran to them and we stood look upon the
golden on
thei saw us and their hand close into fist and the fist
pull their arm down as if thei wish their arm to hold
them while their bodi swai and thei could not speak
we dare not come too close to them we ask and our voic
trembl
how did you come to be here golden on
but thei whisper onli
we have found you
how did you come to be in the forest we ask
thei rais their head and there wa a great pride in their
voic thei answer
we have follow you
then we could not speak and thei said
we heard that you had gone to the unchart forest for the
whole citi is speak of it so on the night of the dai when we
heard it we ran awai from the home of the peasant we found the
mark of your feet across the plain where no men walk so we
follow them and we went into the forest and we follow the
path where the branch were broken by your bodi
their white tunic wa torn and the branch had cut the skin of
their arm but thei spoke as if thei had never taken notic of
it nor of weari nor of fear
we have follow you thei said and we shall follow you
wherev you go if danger threaten you we shall face it also
if it be death we shall die with you you ar damn and we
wish to share your damnat
thei look upon us and their voic wa low but there wa
bitter and triumph in their voic
your ey ar as a flame but our brother have neither hope nor
fire your mouth is cut of granit but our brother ar soft and
humbl your head is high but our brother cring you walk but
our brother crawl we wish to be damn with you rather than
bless with all our brother do as you pleas with us but do
not send us awai from you
then thei knelt and bow their golden head befor us
we had never thought of that which we did we bent to rais the
golden on to their feet but when we touch them it wa as if
mad had stricken us we seiz their bodi and we press our
lip to their the golden on breath onc and their breath
wa a moan and then their arm close around us
we stood togeth for a long time and we were frighten that we
had live for twentyon year and had never known what joi is
possibl to men
then we said
our dearest on fear noth of the forest there is no danger
in solitud we have no need of our brother let us forget their
good and our evil let us forget all thing save that we ar
togeth and that there is joi as a bond between us give us your
hand look ahead it is our own world golden on a strang
unknown world but our own
then we walk on into the forest their hand in our
and that night we knew that to hold the bodi of women in our arm
is neither ugli nor shame but the on ecstasi grant to the
race of men
we have walk for mani dai the forest ha no end and we seek
no end but each dai ad to the chain of dai between us and
the citi is like an ad bless
we have made a bow and mani arrow we can kill more bird than
we need for our food we find water and fruit in the forest at
night we choos a clear and we build a ring of fire around
it we sleep in the midst of that ring and the beast dare not
attack us we can see their ey green and yellow as coal
watch us from the tree branch beyond the fire smoulder as
a crown of jewel around us and smoke stand still in the air
in column made blue by the moonlight we sleep togeth in the
midst of the ring the arm of the golden on around us their
head upon our breast
some dai we shall stop and build a hous when we shall have
gone far enough but we do not have to hasten the dai befor us
ar without end like the forest
we cannot understand thi new life which we have found yet it
seem so clear and so simpl when question come to puzzl us
we walk faster then turn and forget all thing as we watch the
golden on follow the shadow of leav fall upon their arm
as thei spread the branch apart but their shoulder ar in the
sun the skin of their arm is like a blue mist but their
shoulder ar white and glow as if the light fell not from
abov but rose from under their skin we watch the leaf which
ha fallen upon their shoulder and it li at the curv of their
neck and a drop of dew glisten upon it like a jewel thei
approach us and thei stop laugh know what we think and
thei wait obedi without question till it pleas us to
turn and go on
we go on and we bless the earth under our feet but question
come to us again as we walk in silenc if that which we have
found is the corrupt of solitud then what can men wish for
save corrupt if thi is the great evil of be alon then
what is good and what is evil
everyth which come from the mani is good everyth which
come from on is evil thi have we been taught with our first
breath we have broken the law but we have never doubt it yet
now as we walk through the forest we ar learn to doubt
there is no life for men save in us toil for the good of all
their brother but we live not when we toil for our
brother we were onli weari there is no joi for men save the
joi share with all their brother but the onli thing which
taught us joi were the power we creat in our wire and the
golden on and both these joi belong to us alon thei come
from us alon thei bear no relat to all our brother and
thei do not concern our brother in ani wai thu do we wonder
there is some error on fright error in the think of men
what is that error we do not know but the knowledg struggl
within us struggl to be born todai the golden on stop
suddenli and said
we love you
but thei frown and shook their head and look at us
helplessli
no thei whisper that is not what we wish to sai
thei were silent then thei spoke slowli and their word were
halt like the word of a child learn to speak for the
first time
we ar on alon and onli and we love you who ar
on alon and onli
we look into each other ey and we knew that the breath of a
miracl had touch us and fled and left us grope vainli
and we felt torn torn for some word we could not find
part ten
we ar sit at a tabl and we ar write thi upon paper made
thousand of year ago the light is dim and we cannot see the
golden on onli on lock of gold on the pillow of an ancient
bed thi is our home
we came upon it todai at sunris for mani dai we had been
cross a chain of mountain the forest rose among cliff and
whenev we walk out upon a barren stretch of rock we saw great
peak befor us in the west and to the north of us and to the
south as far as our ey could see the peak were red and
brown with the green streak of forest as vein upon them with
blue mist as veil over their head we had never heard of these
mountain nor seen them mark on ani map the unchart forest
ha protect them from the citi and from the men of the
citi
we climb path where the wild goat dare not follow stone
roll from under our feet and we heard them strike the rock
below farther and farther down and the mountain rang with each
stroke and long after the stroke had di but we went on for
we knew that no men would ever follow our track nor reach us
here
then todai at sunris we saw a white flame among the tree
high on a sheer peak befor us we thought that it wa a fire and
stop but the flame wa unmov yet blind as liquid
metal so we climb toward it through the rock and there
befor us on a broad summit with the mountain rise behind
it stood a hous such as we had never seen and the white fire
came from the sun on the glass of it window
the hous had two stori and a strang roof flat as a floor
there wa more window than wall upon it wall and the window
went on straight around the corner though how thi kept the
hous stand we could not guess the wall were hard and
smooth of that stone unlik stone which we had seen in our
tunnel
we both knew it without word thi hous wa left from the
unmention time the tree had protect it from time and
weather and from men who have less piti than time and weather
we turn to the golden on and we ask
ar you afraid
but thei shook their head so we walk to the door and we threw
it open and we step togeth into the hous of the
unmention time
we shall need the dai and the year ahead to look to learn
and to understand the thing of thi hous todai we could onli
look and try to believ the sight of our ey we pull the
heavi curtain from the window and we saw that the room were
small and we thought that not more than twelv men could have
live here we thought it strang that men had been permit to
build a hous for onli twelv
never had we seen room so full of light the sunrai danc upon
color color more color than we thought possibl we who had
seen no hous save the white on the brown on and the grei
there were great piec of glass on the wall but it wa not
glass for when we look upon it we saw our own bodi and all
the thing behind us as on the face of a lake there were
strang thing which we had never seen and the us of which we do
not know and there were globe of glass everywher in each
room the globe with the metal cobweb insid such as we had
seen in our tunnel
we found the sleep hall and we stood in aw upon it
threshold for it wa a small room and there were onli two bed
in it we found no other bed in the hous and then we knew that
onli two had live here and thi pass understand what kind
of world did thei have the men of the unmention time
we found garment and the golden on gasp at the sight of
them for thei were not white tunic nor white toga thei were
of all color no two of them alik some crumbl to dust as we
touch them but other were of heavier cloth and thei felt
soft and new in our finger
we found a room with wall made of shelv which held row of
manuscript from the floor to the ceil never had we seen
such a number of them nor of such strang shape thei were not
soft and roll thei had hard shell of cloth and leather and
the letter on their page were so small and so even that we
wonder at the men who had such handwrit we glanc through
the page and we saw that thei were written in our languag but
we found mani word which we could not understand tomorrow we
shall begin to read these script
when we had seen all the room of the hous we look at the
golden on and we both knew the thought in our mind
we shall never leav thi hous we said nor let it be taken
from us thi is our home and the end of our journei thi is
your hous golden on and our and it belong to no other men
whatev as far as the earth mai stretch we shall not share it
with other as we share not our joi with them nor our love nor
our hunger so be it to the end of our dai
your will be done thei said
then we went out to gather wood for the great hearth of our home
we brought water from the stream which run among the tree under
our window we kill a mountain goat and we brought it flesh
to be cook in a strang copper pot we found in a place of
wonder which must have been the cook room of the hous
we did thi work alon for no word of our could take the
golden on awai from the big glass which is not glass thei stood
befor it and thei look and look upon their own bodi
when the sun sank beyond the mountain the golden on fell
asleep on the floor amidst jewel and bottl of crystal and
flower of silk we lift the golden on in our arm and we
carri them to a bed their head fall softli upon our
shoulder then we lit a candl and we brought paper from the
room of the manuscript and we sat by the window for we knew
that we could not sleep tonight
and now we look upon the earth and sky thi spread of nake rock
and peak and moonlight is like a world readi to be born a world
that wait it seem to us it ask a sign from us a spark a
first command we cannot know what word we ar to give nor
what great deed thi earth expect to wit we know it wait
it seem to sai it ha great gift to lai befor us but it
wish a greater gift for us we ar to speak we ar to give it
goal it highest mean to all thi glow space of rock and
sky
we look ahead we beg our heart for guidanc in answer thi
call no voic ha spoken yet we have heard we look upon our
hand we see the dust of centuri the dust which hid the great
secret and perhap great evil and yet it stir no fear within
our heart but onli silent rever and piti
mai knowledg come to us what is the secret our heart ha
understood and yet will not reveal to us although it seem to
beat as if it were endeavor to tell it
part eleven
i am i think i will
my hand my spirit my sky my forest thi earth of
mine what must i sai besid these ar the word thi is
the answer
i stand here on the summit of the mountain i lift my head and i
spread my arm thi my bodi and spirit thi is the end of the
quest i wish to know the mean of thing i am the mean
i wish to find a warrant for be i need no warrant for
be and no word of sanction upon my be i am the warrant
and the sanction
it is my ey which see and the sight of my ey grant beauti
to the earth it is my ear which hear and the hear of my
ear give it song to the world it is my mind which think and
the judgement of my mind is the onli searchlight that can find
the truth it is my will which choos and the choic of my will
is the onli edict i must respect
mani word have been grant me and some ar wise and some ar
fals but onli three ar holi i will it
whatev road i take the guid star is within me the guid
star and the loadston which point the wai thei point in but on
direct thei point to me
i know not if thi earth on which i stand is the core of the
univers or if it is but a speck of dust lost in etern i know
not and i care not for i know what happi is possibl to me
on earth and my happi need no higher aim to vindic it
my happi is not the mean to ani end it is the end it is
it own goal it is it own purpos
neither am i the mean to ani end other mai wish to accomplish
i am not a tool for their us i am not a servant of their need
i am not a bandag for their wound i am not a sacrific on
their altar
i am a man thi miracl of me is mine to own and keep and mine
to guard and mine to us and mine to kneel befor
i do not surrend my treasur nor do i share them the fortun
of my spirit is not to be blown into coin of brass and flung to
the wind as alm for the poor of the spirit i guard my
treasur my thought my will my freedom and the greatest of
these is freedom
i ow noth to my brother nor do i gather debt from them i
ask none to live for me nor do i live for ani other i covet no
man soul nor is my soul their to covet
i am neither foe nor friend to my brother but such as each of
them shall deserv of me and to earn my love my brother must
do more than to have been born i do not grant my love without
reason nor to ani chanc passerbi who mai wish to claim it i
honor men with my love but honor is a thing to be earn
i shall choos friend among men but neither slave nor master
and i shall choos onli such as pleas me and them i shall love
and respect but neither command nor obei and we shall join our
hand when we wish or walk alon when we so desir for in the
templ of hi spirit each man is alon let each man keep hi
templ untouch and undefil then let him join hand with
other if he wish but onli beyond hi holi threshold
for the word we must never be spoken save by on choic and
as a second thought thi word must never be place first within
man soul els it becom a monster the root of all the evil
on earth the root of man tortur by men and of an unspeak
lie
the word we is as lime pour over men which set and harden
to stone and crush all beneath it and that which is white and
that which is black ar lost equal in the grei of it it is the
word by which the deprav steal the virtu of the good by which
the weak steal the might of the strong by which the fool steal
the wisdom of the sage
what is my joi if all hand even the unclean can reach into it
what is my wisdom if even the fool can dictat to me what is
my freedom if all creatur even the botch and the impot
ar my master what is my life if i am but to bow to agre and
to obei
but i am done with thi creed of corrupt
i am done with the monster of we the word of serfdom of
plunder of miseri falsehood and shame
and now i see the face of god and i rais thi god over the
earth thi god whom men have sought sinc men came into be
thi god who will grant them joi and peac and pride
thi god thi on word
i
part twelv
it wa when i read the first of the book i found in my hous
that i saw the word i and when i understood thi word the
book fell from my hand and i wept i who had never known tear
i wept in deliver and in piti for all mankind
i understood the bless thing which i had call my curs i
understood why the best in me had been my sin and my
transgress and why i had never felt guilt in my sin i
understood that centuri of chain and lash will not kill the
spirit of man nor the sens of truth within him
i read mani book for mani dai then i call the golden on
and i told her what i had read and what i had learn she look
at me and the first word she spoke were
i love you
then i said
my dearest on it is not proper for men to be without name
there wa a time when each man had a name of hi own to
distinguish him from all other men so let us choos our name i
have read of a man who live mani thousand of year ago and of
all the name in these book hi is the on i wish to bear he
took the light of the god and he brought it to men and he
taught men to be god and he suffer for hi deed as all
bearer of light must suffer hi name wa prometheu
it shall be your name said the golden on
and i have read of a goddess i said who wa the mother of
the earth and of all the god her name wa gaea let thi be
your name my golden on for you ar to be the mother of a new
kind of god
it shall be my name said the golden on
now i look ahead my futur is clear befor me the saint of the
pyre had seen the futur when he chose me as hi heir as the
heir of all the saint and all the martyr who came befor him
and who di for the same caus for the same word no matter
what name thei gave to their caus and their truth
i shall live here in my own hous i shall take my food from the
earth by the toil of my own hand i shall learn mani secret
from my book through the year ahead i shall rebuild the
achiev of the past and open the wai to carri them further
the achiev which ar open to me but close forev to my
brother for their mind ar shackl to the weakest and dullest
on among them
i have learn that my power of the sky wa known to men long
ago thei call it electr it wa the power that move
their greatest invent it lit thi hous with light which
came from those globe of glass on the wall i have found the
engin which produc thi light i shall learn how to repair it
and how to make it work again i shall learn how to us the wire
which carri thi power then i shall build a barrier of wire
around my home and across the path which lead to my home a
barrier light as a cobweb more impass than a wall of
granit a barrier my brother will never be abl to cross for
thei have noth to fight me with save the brute forc of their
number i have my mind
then here on thi mountaintop with the world below me and
noth abov me but the sun i shall live my own truth gaea is
pregnant with my child our son will be rais as a man he will
be taught to sai i and to bear the pride of it he will be
taught to walk straight and on hi own feet he will be taught
rever for hi own spirit
when i shall have read all the book and learn my new wai when
my home will be readi and my earth till i shall steal on dai
for the last time into the curs citi of my birth i shall call
to me my friend who ha no name save intern 48818 and
all those like him fratern 25503 who cri without reason
and solidar 96347 who call for help in the night and a few
other i shall call to me all the men and the women whose spirit
ha not been kill within them and who suffer under the yoke of
their brother thei will follow me and i shall lead them to my
fortress and here in thi unchart wilder i and thei my
chosen friend my fellowbuild shall write the first chapter
in the new histori of man
these ar the thing befor me and as i stand here at the door
of glori i look behind me for the last time i look upon the
histori of men which i have learn from the book and i
wonder it wa a long stori and the spirit which move it wa
the spirit of man freedom but what is freedom freedom from
what there is noth to take a man freedom awai from him
save other men to be free a man must be free of hi brother
that is freedom that and noth els
at first man wa enslav by the god but he broke their
chain then he wa enslav by the king but he broke their
chain he wa enslav by hi birth by hi kin by hi race
but he broke their chain he declar to all hi brother that a
man ha right which neither god nor king nor other men can take
awai from him no matter what their number for hi is the right
of man and there is no right on earth abov thi right and he
stood on the threshold of the freedom for which the blood of the
centuri behind him had been spill
but then he gave up all he had won and fell lower than hi
savag begin
what brought it to pass what disast took their reason awai
from men what whip lash them to their knee in shame and
submiss the worship of the word we
when men accept that worship the structur of centuri
collaps about them the structur whose everi beam had come
from the thought of some on man each in hi dai down the ag
from the depth of some on spirit such spirit as exist but for
it own sake those men who surviv those eager to obei eager
to live for on anoth sinc thei had noth els to vindic
themthos men could neither carri on nor preserv what thei had
receiv thu did all thought all scienc all wisdom perish on
earth thu did menmen with noth to offer save their great
numberlost the steel tower the fly ship the power wire
all the thing thei had not creat and could never keep
perhap later some men had been born with the mind and the
courag to recov these thing which were lost perhap these
men came befor the council of scholar thei were answer as i
have been answeredand for the same reason
but i still wonder how it wa possibl in those graceless year
of transit long ago that men did not see whither thei were
go and went on in blind and cowardic to their fate i
wonder for it is hard for me to conceiv how men who knew the
word i could give it up and not know what thei lost but such
ha been the stori for i have live in the citi of the damn
and i know what horror men permit to be brought upon them
perhap in those dai there were a few among men a few of
clear sight and clean soul who refus to surrend that word
what agoni must have been their befor that which thei saw
come and could not stop perhap thei cri out in protest and
in warn but men paid no heed to their warn and thei
these few fought a hopeless battl and thei perish with their
banner smear by their own blood and thei chose to perish for
thei knew to them i send my salut across the centuri and my
piti
their is the banner in my hand and i wish i had the power to
tell them that the despair of their heart wa not to be final
and their night wa not without hope for the battl thei lost
can never be lost for that which thei di to save can never
perish through all the dark through all the shame of which
men ar capabl the spirit of man will remain aliv on thi
earth it mai sleep but it will awaken it mai wear chain but
it will break through and man will go on man not men
here on thi mountain i and my son and my chosen friend shall
build our new land and our fort and it will becom as the heart
of the earth lost and hidden at first but beat beat
louder each dai and word of it will reach everi corner of the
earth and the road of the world will becom as vein which will
carri the best of the world blood to my threshold and all my
brother and the council of my brother will hear of it but
thei will be impot against me and the dai will come when i
shall break all the chain of the earth and raze the citi of
the enslav and my home will becom the capit of a world
where each man will be free to exist for hi own sake
for the come of that dai shall i fight i and my son and my
chosen friend for the freedom of man for hi right for hi
life for hi honor
and here over the portal of my fort i shall cut in the stone
the word which is to be my beacon and my banner the word which
will not die should we all perish in battl the word which can
never die on thi earth for it is the heart of it and the
mean and the glori
the sacr word
