in which it is prove that notwithstand their name end in os
and is the hero of the stori which we ar about to have the honor
to relat to our reader have noth mytholog about them
a short time ago while make research in the royal librari for my
histori of loui xiv i stumbl by chanc upon the memoir of m
dartagnan printeda were most of the work of that period in which
author could not tell the truth without the risk of a resid more
or less long in the bastilleat amsterdam by pierr roug the titl
attract me i took them home with me with the permiss of the
guardian and devour them
it is not my intent here to enter into an analysi of thi curiou
work and i shall satisfi myself with refer such of my reader as
appreci the pictur of the period to it page thei will therein
find portrait pencil by the hand of a master and although these
squib mai be for the most part trace upon the door of barrack and
the wall of cabaret thei will not find the like of loui xiii
ann of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtier of the period
less faith than in the histori of m anquetil
but it is well known what strike the caprici mind of the poet is
not alwai what affect the mass of reader now while admir as
other doubtless will admir the detail we have to relat our main
preoccup concern a matter to which no on befor ourselv had
given a thought
dartagnan relat that on hi first visit to m de trvill captain
of the king musket he met in the antechamb three young men
serv in the illustri corp into which he wa solicit the honor
of be receiv bear the name of atho portho and arami
we must confess these three strang name struck us and it immedi
occur to us that thei were but pseudonym under which dartagnan
had disguis name perhap illustri or els that the bearer of
these borrow name had themselv chosen them on the dai in which
from capric discont or want of fortun thei had don the
simpl musket uniform
from that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in
contemporari work of these extraordinari name which had so strongli
awaken our curios
the catalogu alon of the book we read with thi object would fill a
whole chapter which although it might be veri instruct would
certainli afford our reader but littl amus it will suffic
then to tell them that at the moment at which discourag by so mani
fruitless investig we were about to abandon our search we at
length found guid by the counsel of our illustri friend paulin
pari a manuscript in folio endors 4772 or 4773 we do not
recollect which have for titl memoir of the comt de la fre
touch some event which pass in franc toward the end of the reign
of king loui xiii and the commenc of the reign of king loui
xiv
it mai be easili imagin how great wa our joi when in turn over
thi manuscript our last hope we found at the twentieth page the name
of atho at the twentyseventh the name of portho and at the
thirtyfirst the name of arami
the discoveri of a complet unknown manuscript at a period in which
histor scienc is carri to such a high degre appear almost
miracul we hasten therefor to obtain permiss to print it
with the view of present ourselv somedai with the pack of other
at the door of the acadmi de inscript et bell lettr if we
should not succeeda veri probabl thing by the byin gain
admiss to the acadmi franais with our own proper pack thi
permiss we feel bound to sai wa gracious grant which compel
us here to give a public contradict to the slander who pretend
that we live under a govern but moder indulg to men of
letter
now thi is the first part of thi preciou manuscript which we offer
to our reader restor it to the titl which belong to it and
enter into an engag that if of which we have no doubt thi
first part should obtain the success it merit we will publish the
second immedi
in the meanwhil as the godfath is a second father we beg the
reader to lai to our account and not to that of the comt de la fre
the pleasur or the ennui he mai experi
thi be understood let us proce with our histori
the three musket
chapter i
the three present of dartagnan the elder
on the first mondai of the month of april 1625 the market town of
meung in which the author of romanc of the rose wa born appear
to be in as perfect a state of revolut as if the huguenot had just
made a second la rochel of it mani citizen see the women fly
toward the high street leav their children cry at the open
door hasten to don the cuirass and support their somewhat
uncertain courag with a musket or a partisan direct their step
toward the hostelri of the jolli miller befor which wa gather
increas everi minut a compact group vocifer and full of
curios
in those time panic were common and few dai pass without some
citi or other regist in it archiv an event of thi kind there
were nobl who made war against each other there wa the king who
made war against the cardin there wa spain which made war against
the king then in addit to these conceal or public secret or
open war there were robber mendic huguenot wolv and
scoundrel who made war upon everybodi the citizen alwai took up
arm readili against thiev wolv or scoundrel often against
nobl or huguenot sometim against the king but never against the
cardin or spain it result then from thi habit that on the said
first mondai of april 1625 the citizen on hear the clamor and
see neither the redandyellow standard nor the liveri of the duc de
richelieu rush toward the hostel of the jolli miller when arriv
there the caus of the hubbub wa appar to all
a young manw can sketch hi portrait at a dash imagin to yourself a
don quixot of eighteen a don quixot without hi corselet without
hi coat of mail without hi cuiss a don quixot cloth in a
woolen doublet the blue color of which had fade into a nameless shade
between lee of wine and a heavenli azur face long and brown high
cheek bone a sign of sagac the maxillari muscl enorm
develop an infal sign by which a gascon mai alwai be detect
even without hi capand our young man wore a cap set off with a sort
of feather the ey open and intellig the nose hook but fine
chisel too big for a youth too small for a grown man an
experienc ey might have taken him for a farmer son upon a journei
had it not been for the long sword which dangl from a leather
baldric hit against the calv of it owner as he walk and against
the rough side of hi steed when he wa on horseback
for our young man had a steed which wa the observ of all observ
it wa a barn poni from twelv to fourteen year old yellow in hi
hide without a hair in hi tail but not without windgal on hi
leg which though go with hi head lower than hi knee render
a martingal quit unnecessari contriv nevertheless to perform hi
eight leagu a dai unfortun the qualiti of thi hors were so
well conceal under hi strangecolor hide and hi unaccount
gait that at a time when everybodi wa a connoisseur in horseflesh
the appear of the aforesaid poni at meungwhich place he had
enter about a quarter of an hour befor by the gate of
beaugencyproduc an unfavor feel which extend to hi rider
and thi feel had been more painfulli perceiv by young
dartagnanfor so wa the don quixot of thi second rosinant
namedfrom hi not be abl to conceal from himself the ridicul
appear that such a steed gave him good horseman as he wa he had
sigh deepli therefor when accept the gift of the poni from m
dartagnan the elder he wa not ignor that such a beast wa worth
at least twenti livr and the word which had accompani the present
were abov all price
my son said the old gascon gentleman in that pure barn patoi of
which henri iv could never rid himself thi hors wa born in the
hous of your father about thirteen year ago and ha remain in it
ever sinc which ought to make you love it never sell it allow it to
die tranquilli and honor of old ag and if you make a campaign
with it take as much care of it as you would of an old servant at
court provid you have ever the honor to go there continu m
dartagnan the elder an honor to which rememb your ancient
nobil give you the rightsustain worthili your name of gentleman
which ha been worthili born by your ancestor for five hundr year
both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you by the
latter i mean your rel and friend endur noth from anyon
except monsieur the cardin and the king it is by hi courag pleas
observ by hi courag alon that a gentleman can make hi wai
nowadai whoever hesit for a second perhap allow the bait to
escap which dure that exact second fortun held out to him you ar
young you ought to be brave for two reason the first is that you ar
a gascon and the second is that you ar my son never fear quarrel
but seek adventur i have taught you how to handl a sword you have
thew of iron a wrist of steel fight on all occas fight the more
for duel be forbidden sinc consequ there is twice as much
courag in fight i have noth to give you my son but fifteen
crown my hors and the counsel you have just heard your mother
will add to them a recip for a certain balsam which she had from a
bohemian and which ha the miracul virtu of cure all wound that
do not reach the heart take advantag of all and live happili and
long i have but on word to add and that is to propos an exampl to
younot mine for i myself have never appear at court and have onli
taken part in religi war as a volunt i speak of monsieur de
trvill who wa formerli my neighbor and who had the honor to be as
a child the playfellow of our king loui xiii whom god preserv
sometim their plai degener into battl and in these battl the
king wa not alwai the stronger the blow which he receiv increas
greatli hi esteem and friendship for monsieur de trvill afterward
monsieur de trvill fought with other in hi first journei to pari
five time from the death of the late king till the young on came of
ag without reckon war and sieg seven time and from that date
up to the present dai a hundr time perhap so that in spite of
edict ordin and decre there he is captain of the
musket that is to sai chief of a legion of csar whom the king
hold in great esteem and whom the cardin dreadsh who dread
noth as it is said still further monsieur de trvill gain ten
thousand crown a year he is therefor a great nobl he began as you
begin go to him with thi letter and make him your model in order
that you mai do as he ha done
upon which m dartagnan the elder gird hi own sword round hi son
kiss him tenderli on both cheek and gave him hi benedict
on leav the patern chamber the young man found hi mother who
wa wait for him with the famou recip of which the counsel we
have just repeat would necessit frequent employ the adieux
were on thi side longer and more tender than thei had been on the
othernot that m dartagnan did not love hi son who wa hi onli
offspr but m dartagnan wa a man and he would have consid it
unworthi of a man to give wai to hi feel wherea mme dartagnan
wa a woman and still more a mother she wept abundantli andlet us
speak it to the prais of m dartagnan the youngernotwithstand the
effort he made to remain firm as a futur musket ought natur
prevail and he shed mani tear of which he succeed with great
difficulti in conceal the half
the same dai the young man set forward on hi journei furnish with
the three patern gift which consist as we have said of fifteen
crown the hors and the letter for m de trvilleth counsel be
thrown into the bargain
with such a vade mecum dartagnan wa moral and physic an exact
copi of the hero of cervant to whom we so happili compar him when
our duti of an historian place us under the necess of sketch hi
portrait don quixot took windmil for giant and sheep for armi
dartagnan took everi smile for an insult and everi look as a
provocationwh it result that from tarb to meung hi fist wa
constantli doubl or hi hand on the hilt of hi sword and yet the
fist did not descend upon ani jaw nor did the sword issu from it
scabbard it wa not that the sight of the wretch poni did not excit
numer smile on the counten of passersbi but as against the
side of thi poni rattl a sword of respect length and as over
thi sword gleam an ey rather feroci than haughti these
passersbi repress their hilar or if hilar prevail over
prudenc thei endeavor to laugh onli on on side like the mask of
the ancient dartagnan then remain majest and intact in hi
suscept till he came to thi unlucki citi of meung
but there as he wa alight from hi hors at the gate of the jolli
miller without anyonehost waiter or hostlercom to hold hi
stirrup or take hi hors dartagnan spi though an open window on
the ground floor a gentleman wellmad and of good carriag although
of rather a stern counten talk with two person who appear to
listen to him with respect dartagnan fanci quit natur
accord to hi custom that he must be the object of their
convers and listen thi time dartagnan wa onli in part
mistaken he himself wa not in question but hi hors wa the
gentleman appear to be enumer all hi qualiti to hi auditor
and as i have said the auditor seem to have great defer for
the narrat thei everi moment burst into fit of laughter now as a
halfsmil wa suffici to awaken the irasc of the young man
the effect produc upon him by thi vocifer mirth mai be easili
imagin
nevertheless dartagnan wa desir of examin the appear of
thi impertin personag who ridicul him he fix hi haughti ey
upon the stranger and perceiv a man of from forti to fortyf
year of ag with black and pierc ey pale complexion a strongli
mark nose and a black and wellshap mustach he wa dress in a
doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillett of the same
color without ani other ornament than the customari slash through
which the shirt appear thi doublet and hose though new were
creas like travel cloth for a long time pack in a
portmanteau dartagnan made all these remark with the rapid of a
most minut observ and doubtless from an instinct feel that
thi stranger wa destin to have a great influenc over hi futur
life
now as at the moment in which dartagnan fix hi ey upon the
gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made on of hi most
know and profound remark respect the barnes poni hi two
auditor laugh even louder than befor and he himself though
contrari to hi custom allow a pale smile if i mai be allow to
us such an express to strai over hi counten thi time there
could be no doubt dartagnan wa realli insult full then of thi
convict he pull hi cap down over hi ey and endeavor to
copi some of the court air he had pick up in gasconi among young
travel nobl he advanc with on hand on the hilt of hi sword
and the other rest on hi hip unfortun as he advanc hi
anger increas at everi step and instead of the proper and lofti
speech he had prepar as a prelud to hi challeng he found noth
at the tip of hi tongu but a gross person which he accompani
with a furiou gestur
i sai sir you sir who ar hide yourself behind that shuttery
you sir tell me what you ar laugh at and we will laugh
togeth
the gentleman rais hi ey slowli from the nag to hi cavali as
if he requir some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that
such strang reproach were address then when he could not
possibl entertain ani doubt of the matter hi eyebrow slightli bent
and with an accent of ironi and insol imposs to be describ
he repli to dartagnan i wa not speak to you sir
but i am speak to you repli the young man addition
exasper with thi mixtur of insol and good manner of
polit and scorn
the stranger look at him again with a slight smile and retir from
the window came out of the hostelri with a slow step and place
himself befor the hors within two pace of dartagnan hi quiet
manner and the iron express of hi counten redoubl the
mirth of the person with whom he had been talk and who still
remain at the window
dartagnan see him approach drew hi sword a foot out of the
scabbard
thi hors is decidedli or rather ha been in hi youth a
buttercup resum the stranger continu the remark he had begun
and address himself to hi auditor at the window without pai
the least attent to the exasper of dartagnan who howev
place himself between him and them it is a color veri well known in
botani but till the present time veri rare among hors
there ar peopl who laugh at the hors that would not dare to laugh
at the master cri the young emul of the furiou trvill
i do not often laugh sir repli the stranger as you mai perceiv
by the express of my counten but nevertheless i retain the
privileg of laugh when i pleas
and i cri dartagnan will allow no man to laugh when it
displeas me
inde sir continu the stranger more calm than ever well that
is perfectli right and turn on hi heel wa about to reenter the
hostelri by the front gate beneath which dartagnan on arriv had
observ a saddl hors
but dartagnan wa not of a charact to allow a man to escap him
thu who had the insol to ridicul him he drew hi sword entir
from the scabbard and follow him cry turn turn master joker
lest i strike you behind
strike me said the other turn on hi heel and survei the
young man with as much astonish as contempt why my good fellow
you must be mad then in a suppress tone as if speak to
himself thi is annoi continu he what a godsend thi would
be for hi majesti who is seek everywher for brave fellow to
recruit for hi musket
he had scarc finish when dartagnan made such a furiou lung at
him that if he had not sprung nimbl backward it is probabl he would
have jest for the last time the stranger then perceiv that the
matter went beyond railleri drew hi sword salut hi adversari and
serious place himself on guard but at the same moment hi two
auditor accompani by the host fell upon dartagnan with stick
shovel and tong thi caus so rapid and complet a divers from
the attack that dartagnan adversari while the latter turn round
to face thi shower of blow sheath hi sword with the same
precis and instead of an actor which he had nearli been becam a
spectat of the fighta part in which he acquit himself with hi
usual impass mutter nevertheless a plagu upon these
gascon replac him on hi orang hors and let him begon
not befor i have kill you poltroon cri dartagnan make the
best face possibl and never retreat on step befor hi three
assail who continu to shower blow upon him
anoth gasconad murmur the gentleman by my honor these
gascon ar incorrig keep up the danc then sinc he will have
it so when he is tire he will perhap tell us that he ha had enough
of it
but the stranger knew not the headstrong personag he had to do with
dartagnan wa not the man ever to cry for quarter the fight wa
therefor prolong for some second but at length dartagnan drop
hi sword which wa broken in two piec by the blow of a stick
anoth blow full upon hi forehead at the same moment brought him to
the ground cover with blood and almost faint
it wa at thi moment that peopl came flock to the scene of action
from all side the host fear of consequ with the help of hi
servant carri the wound man into the kitchen where some trifl
attent were bestow upon him
as to the gentleman he resum hi place at the window and survei
the crowd with a certain impati evid annoi by their
remain undispers
well how is it with thi madman exclaim he turn round as the
nois of the door announc the entranc of the host who came in to
inquir if he wa unhurt
your excel is safe and sound ask the host
oh ye perfectli safe and sound my good host and i wish to know
what ha becom of our young man
he is better said the host he faint quit awai
inde said the gentleman
but befor he faint he collect all hi strength to challeng you
and to defi you while challeng you
why thi fellow must be the devil in person cri the stranger
oh no your excel he is not the devil repli the host with
a grin of contempt for dure hi faint we rummag hi valis and
found noth but a clean shirt and eleven crownswhich howev did
not prevent hi sai as he wa faint that if such a thing had
happen in pari you should have caus to repent of it at a later
period
then said the stranger coolli he must be some princ in disguis
i have told you thi good sir resum the host in order that you
mai be on your guard
did he name no on in hi passion
ye he struck hi pocket and said we shall see what monsieur de
trvill will think of thi insult offer to hi protg
monsieur de trvill said the stranger becom attent he put
hi hand upon hi pocket while pronounc the name of monsieur de
trvill now my dear host while your young man wa insens you
did not fail i am quit sure to ascertain what that pocket contain
what wa there in it
a letter address to monsieur de trvill captain of the
musket
inde
exactli as i have the honor to tell your excel
the host who wa not endow with great perspicac did not observ
the express which hi word had given to the physiognomi of the
stranger the latter rose from the front of the window upon the sill
of which he had lean with hi elbow and knit hi brow like a man
disquiet
the devil murmur he between hi teeth can trvill have set
thi gascon upon me he is veri young but a sword thrust is a sword
thrust whatev be the ag of him who give it and a youth is less to
be suspect than an older man and the stranger fell into a reveri
which last some minut a weak obstacl is sometim suffici to
overthrow a great design
host said he could you not contriv to get rid of thi frantic boi
for me in conscienc i cannot kill him and yet ad he with a
coldli menac express he annoi me where is he
in my wife chamber on the first flight where thei ar dress hi

bow humbl and retir
it is not necessari for miladi to be seen by thi fellow continu
the stranger she will soon pass she is alreadi late i had better
get on horseback and go and meet her i should like howev to know
what thi letter address to trvill contain and the stranger
mutter to himself direct hi step toward the kitchen
we ar well awar that thi term miladi is onli properli us when
follow by a famili name but we find it thu in the manuscript and
we do not choos to take upon ourselv to alter it
in the meantim the host who entertain no doubt that it wa the
presenc of the young man that drove the stranger from hi hostelri
reascend to hi wife chamber and found dartagnan just recov
hi sens give him to understand that the polic would deal with
him pretti sever for have sought a quarrel with a great lordfor
in the opinion of the host the stranger could be noth less than a
great lordh insist that notwithstand hi weak dartagnan
should get up and depart as quickli as possibl dartagnan half
stupefi without hi doublet and with hi head bound up in a linen
cloth aros then and urg by the host began to descend the stair
but on arriv at the kitchen the first thing he saw wa hi
antagonist talk calmli at the step of a heavi carriag drawn by two
larg norman hors
hi interlocutor whose head appear through the carriag window wa
a woman of from twenti to twoandtwenti year we have alreadi
observ with what rapid dartagnan seiz the express of a
counten he perceiv then at a glanc that thi woman wa young
and beauti and her style of beauti struck him more forcibl from
it be total differ from that of the southern countri in
which dartagnan had hitherto resid she wa pale and fair with long
curl fall in profus over her shoulder had larg blue
languish ey rosi lip and hand of alabast she wa talk
with great anim with the stranger
hi emin then order me said the ladi

the stranger wa about to repli but at the moment he open hi mouth
dartagnan who had heard all precipit himself over the threshold
of the door
thi insol boi chastis other cri he and i hope that thi
time he whom he ought to chastis will not escap him as befor
will not escap him repli the stranger knit hi brow
no befor a woman you would dare not fly i presum
rememb said miladi see the stranger lai hi hand on hi sword

hi turn after the servant but hi wound had render him too weak to
support such an exert scarc had he gone ten step when hi ear
began to tingl a faint seiz him a cloud of blood pass over
hi ey and he fell in the middl of the street cry still
coward coward coward
he is a coward inde grumbl the host draw near to
dartagnan and endeavor by thi littl flatteri to make up matter
with the young man as the heron of the fabl did with the snail he had
despis the even befor
ye a base coward murmur dartagnan but shesh wa veri
beauti
what she demand the host
miladi falter dartagnan and faint a second time
ah it all on said the host i have lost two custom but thi
on remain of whom i am pretti certain for some dai to come there
will be eleven crown gain
it is to be rememb that eleven crown wa just the sum that
remain in dartagnan purs
the host had reckon upon eleven dai of confin at a crown a dai
but he had reckon without hi guest on the follow morn at five
oclock dartagnan aros and descend to the kitchen without help
ask among other ingredi the list of which ha not come down to
us for some oil some wine and some rosemari and with hi mother
recip in hi hand compos a balsam with which he anoint hi
numer wound replac hi bandag himself and posit
refus the assist of ani doctor dartagnan walk about that
same even and wa almost cure by the morrow
but when the time came to pai for hi rosemari thi oil and the wine
the onli expens the master had incur as he had preserv a strict
abstinencewhil on the contrari the yellow hors by the account of
the hostler at least had eaten three time as much as a hors of hi
size could reason be suppos to have donedartagnan found noth
in hi pocket but hi littl old velvet purs with the eleven crown it
contain for as to the letter address to m de trvill it had
disappear
the young man commenc hi search for the letter with the greatest
patienc turn out hi pocket of all kind over and over again
rummag and rerummag in hi valis and open and reopen hi
purs but when he found that he had come to the convict that the
letter wa not to be found he flew for the third time into such a
rage as wa near cost him a fresh consumpt of wine oil and
rosemaryfor upon see thi hothead youth becom exasper and
threaten to destroi everyth in the establish if hi letter were
not found the host seiz a spit hi wife a broom handl and the
servant the same stick thei had us the dai befor
my letter of recommend cri dartagnan my letter of
recommend or the holi blood i will spit you all like ortolan
unfortun there wa on circumst which creat a power
obstacl to the accomplish of thi threat which wa as we have
relat that hi sword had been in hi first conflict broken in two
and which he had entir forgotten henc it result when dartagnan
proceed to draw hi sword in earnest he found himself pure and
simpli arm with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inch in
length which the host had carefulli place in the scabbard as to the
rest of the blade the master had slyli put that on on side to make
himself a lard pin
but thi decept would probabl not have stop our fieri young man
if the host had not reflect that the reclam which hi guest made
wa perfectli just
but after all said he lower the point of hi spit where is
thi letter
ye where is thi letter cri dartagnan in the first place i
warn you that that letter is for monsieur de trvill and it must be
found or if it is not found he will know how to find it

chapter ii
the antechamb of m de trvill
m de troisvil as hi famili wa still call in gasconi or m de
trvill as he ha end by style himself in pari had realli
commenc life as dartagnan now did that is to sai without a sou in
hi pocket but with a fund of audac shrewd and intellig
which make the poorest gascon gentleman often deriv more in hi hope
from the patern inherit than the richest perigordian or berrichan
gentleman deriv in realiti from hi hi insol braveri hi still
more insol success at a time when blow pour down like hail had
born him to the top of that difficult ladder call court favor which
he had climb four step at a time
he wa the friend of the king who honor highli as everyon know
the memori of hi father henri iv the father of m de trvill had
serv him so faithfulli in hi war against the leagu that in default
of moneya thing to which the barnai wa accustom all hi life and
who constantli paid hi debt with that of which he never stood in need
of borrow that is to sai with readi witin default of monei we
repeat he author him after the reduct of pari to assum for
hi arm a golden lion passant upon gule with the motto fide et
forti thi wa a great matter in the wai of honor but veri littl
in the wai of wealth so that when the illustri companion of the
great henri di the onli inherit he wa abl to leav hi son wa
hi sword and hi motto thank to thi doubl gift and the spotless
name that accompani it m de trvill wa admit into the
household of the young princ where he made such good us of hi sword
and wa so faith to hi motto that loui xiii on of the good
blade of hi kingdom wa accustom to sai that if he had a friend
who wa about to fight he would advis him to choos as a second
himself first and trvill nextor even perhap befor himself
thu loui xiii had a real like for trvillea royal like a
selfinterest like it is true but still a like at that unhappi
period it wa an import consider to be surround by such men
as trvill mani might take for their devic the epithet strong
which form the second part of hi motto but veri few gentlemen could
lai claim to the faith which constitut the first trvill wa
on of these latter hi wa on of those rare organ endow
with an obedi intellig like that of the dog with a blind valor
a quick ey and a prompt hand to whom sight appear onli to be given
to see if the king were dissatisfi with anyon and the hand to
strike thi displeas personag whether a besm a maurev a
poltiot de mr or a vitri in short up to thi period noth had
been want to trvill but opportun but he wa ever on the watch
for it and he faithfulli promis himself that he would not fail to
seiz it by it three hair whenev it came within reach of hi hand
at last loui xiii made trvill the captain of hi musket who
were to loui xiii in devoted or rather in fanatic what hi
ordinari had been to henri iii and hi scotch guard to loui xi
on hi part the cardin wa not behind the king in thi respect when
he saw the formid and chosen bodi with which loui xiii had
surround himself thi second or rather thi first king of franc
becam desir that he too should have hi guard he had hi
musket therefor as loui xiii had hi and these two power
rival vi with each other in procur not onli from all the
provinc of franc but even from all foreign state the most
celebr swordsmen it wa not uncommon for richelieu and loui xiii
to disput over their even game of chess upon the merit of their
servant each boast the bear and the courag of hi own peopl
while exclaim loudli against duel and brawl thei excit them
secretli to quarrel deriv an immoder satisfact or genuin
regret from the success or defeat of their own combat we learn
thi from the memoir of a man who wa concern in some few of these
defeat and in mani of these victori
trvill had grasp the weak side of hi master and it wa to thi
address that he ow the long and constant favor of a king who ha not
left the reput behind him of be veri faith in hi
friendship he parad hi musket befor the cardin armand
duplessi with an insol air which made the grai moustach of hi

contigu to thi antechamb receiv visit listen to
complaint gave hi order and like the king in hi balconi at the
louvr had onli to place himself at the window to review both hi men
and arm
the dai on which dartagnan present himself the assemblag wa
impos particularli for a provinci just arriv from hi
provinc it is true that thi provinci wa a gascon and that
particularli at thi period the compatriot of dartagnan had the
reput of not be easili intimid when he had onc pass the
massiv door cover with long squarehead nail he fell into the
midst of a troop of swordsmen who cross on anoth in their
passag call out quarrel and plai trick on with anoth
in order to make on wai amid these turbul and conflict wave
it wa necessari to be an offic a great nobl or a pretti woman
it wa then into the midst of thi tumult and disord that our young
man advanc with a beat heart rang hi long rapier up hi lanki
leg and keep on hand on the edg of hi cap with that halfsmil
of the embarrass provinci who wish to put on a good face when he
had pass on group he began to breath more freeli but he could not
help observ that thei turn round to look at him and for the first
time in hi life dartagnan who had till that dai entertain a veri
good opinion of himself felt ridicul
arriv at the staircas it wa still wors there were four
musket on the bottom step amus themselv with the follow
exercis while ten or twelv of their comrad wait upon the land
place to take their turn in the sport
on of them station upon the top stair nake sword in hand
prevent or at least endeavor to prevent the three other from
ascend
these three other fenc against him with their agil sword
dartagnan at first took these weapon for foil and believ them to
be button but he soon perceiv by certain scratch that everi
weapon wa point and sharpen and that at each of these scratch
not onli the spectat but even the actor themselv laugh like
so mani madmen
he who at the moment occupi the upper step kept hi adversari
marvel in check a circl wa form around them the condit
requir that at everi hit the man touch should quit the game
yield hi turn for the benefit of the adversari who had hit him in
five minut three were slightli wound on on the hand anoth on
the ear by the defend of the stair who himself remain intacta
piec of skill which wa worth to him accord to the rule agre
upon three turn of favor
howev difficult it might be or rather as he pretend it wa to
astonish our young travel thi pastim realli astonish him he had
seen in hi provincethat land in which head becom so easili heateda
few of the preliminari of duel but the dare of these four fencer
appear to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in gasconi he
believ himself transport into that famou countri of giant into
which gulliv afterward went and wa so frighten and yet he had not
gain the goal for there were still the land place and the
antechamb
on the land thei were no longer fight but amus themselv with
stori about women and in the antechamb with stori about the
court on the land dartagnan blush in the antechamb he
trembl hi warm and fickl imagin which in gasconi had
render him formid to young chambermaid and even sometim their
mistress had never dream even in moment of delirium of half the
amor wonder or a quarter of the feat of gallantri which were here
set forth in connect with name the best known and with detail the
least conceal but if hi moral were shock on the land hi
respect for the cardin wa scandal in the antechamb there to
hi great astonish dartagnan heard the polici which made all
europ trembl critic aloud and openli as well as the privat life
of the cardin which so mani great nobl had been punish for
try to pry into that great man who wa so rever by dartagnan the
elder serv as an object of ridicul to the musket of trvill
who crack their joke upon hi bandi leg and hi crook back some
sang ballad about mme daguillon hi mistress and mme cambalet
hi niec while other form parti and plan to annoi the page and
guard of the cardin dukeal thing which appear to dartagnan
monstrou imposs
nevertheless when the name of the king wa now and then utter
unthinkingli amid all these cardin jest a sort of gag seem to
close for a moment on all these jeer mouth thei look
hesitatingli around them and appear to doubt the thick of the
partit between them and the offic of m de trvill but a fresh
allus soon brought back the convers to hi emin and then
the laughter recov it loud and the light wa not withheld from
ani of hi action
cert these fellow will all either be imprison or hang
thought the terrifi dartagnan and i no doubt with them for from
the moment i have either listen to or heard them i shall be held as
an accomplic what would my good father sai who so strongli point
out to me the respect due to the cardin if he knew i wa in the
societi of such pagan
we have no need therefor to sai that dartagnan dare not join in
the convers onli he look with all hi ey and listen with
all hi ear stretch hi five sens so as to lose noth and
despit hi confid on the patern admonit he felt himself
carri by hi tast and led by hi instinct to prais rather than to
blame the unheardof thing which were take place
although he wa a perfect stranger in the court of m de trvill
courtier and thi hi first appear in that place he wa at
length notic and somebodi came and ask him what he want at thi
demand dartagnan gave hi name veri modestli emphas the titl of
compatriot and beg the servant who had put the question to him to
request a moment audienc of m de trvillea request which the
other with an air of protect promis to transmit in due season
dartagnan a littl recov from hi first surpris had now leisur
to studi costum and physiognomi
the center of the most anim group wa a musket of great height
and haughti counten dress in a costum so peculiar as to attract
gener attent he did not wear the uniform cloakwhich wa not
obligatori at that epoch of less liberti but more independencebut a
ceruleanblu doublet a littl fade and worn and over thi a
magnific baldric work in gold which shone like water rippl in
the sun a long cloak of crimson velvet fell in grace fold from hi
shoulder disclos in front the splendid baldric from which wa
suspend a gigant rapier thi musket had just come off guard
complain of have a cold and cough from time to time affectedli
it wa for thi reason as he said to those around him that he had put
on hi cloak and while he spoke with a lofti air and twist hi
mustach disdainfulli all admir hi embroid baldric and
dartagnan more than anyon
what would you have said the musket thi fashion is come in
it is a folli i admit but still it is the fashion besid on must
lai out on inherit somehow
ah portho cri on of hi companion dont try to make us

thi other musket form a perfect contrast to hi interrog who
had just design him by the name of arami he wa a stout man of
about two or threeandtwenti with an open ingenu counten a
black mild ey and cheek rosi and downi as an autumn peach hi
delic mustach mark a perfectli straight line upon hi upper lip
he appear to dread to lower hi hand lest their vein should swell
and he pinch the tip of hi ear from time to time to preserv their
delic pink transpar habitu he spoke littl and slowli
bow frequent laugh without nois show hi teeth which were
fine and of which as the rest of hi person he appear to take great
care he answer the appeal of hi friend by an affirm nod of the
head
thi affirm appear to dispel all doubt with regard to the
baldric thei continu to admir it but said no more about it and
with a rapid chang of thought the convers pass suddenli to
anoth subject

dartagnan look for some tapestri behind which he might hide himself
and felt an immens inclin to crawl under the tabl
well my captain said portho quit besid himself the truth is
that we were six against six but we were not captur by fair mean

and he set off run as if the devil possess him hope that he
might yet find the stranger whose slow pace could not have carri him
far
but at the street gate portho wa talk with the soldier on guard
between the two talker there wa just enough room for a man to pass
dartagnan thought it would suffic for him and he sprang forward like
a dart between them but dartagnan had reckon without the wind as
he wa about to pass the wind blew out porthoss long cloak and
dartagnan rush straight into the middl of it without doubt
portho had reason for not abandon thi part of hi vestment for
instead of quit hi hold on the flap in hi hand he pull it
toward him so that dartagnan roll himself up in the velvet by a
movement of rotat explain by the persist of portho
dartagnan hear the musket swear wish to escap from the
cloak which blind him and sought to find hi wai from under the
fold of it he wa particularli anxiou to avoid mar the fresh
of the magnific baldric we ar acquaint with but on timidli
open hi ey he found himself with hi nose fix between the two
shoulder of porthosthat is to sai exactli upon the baldric
ala like most thing in thi world which have noth in their favor
but appear the baldric wa glitter with gold in the front but
wa noth but simpl buff behind vainglori as he wa portho
could not afford to have a baldric wholli of gold but had at least
half on could comprehend the necess of the cold and the urgenc of
the cloak
bless me cri portho make strong effort to disembarrass
himself of dartagnan who wa wriggl about hi back you must be
mad to run against peopl in thi manner
excus me said dartagnan reappear under the shoulder of the
giant but i am in such hastei wa run after someon and
and do you alwai forget your ey when you run ask portho

what other peopl cannot see
whether portho understood him or did not understand him give wai to
hi anger monsieur said he you stand a chanc of get
chastis if you rub musket in thi fashion
chastis monsieur said dartagnan the express is strong
it is on that becom a man accustom to look hi enemi in the
face
ah pardieu i know full well that you dont turn your back to
your
and the young man delight with hi joke went awai laugh loudli
portho foam with rage and made a movement to rush after dartagnan
present present cri the latter when you havent your cloak
on
at on oclock then behind the luxembourg
veri well at on oclock then repli dartagnan turn the
angl of the street
but neither in the street he had pass through nor in the on which
hi eager glanc pervad could he see anyon howev slowli the
stranger had walk he wa gone on hi wai or perhap had enter
some hous dartagnan inquir of everyon he met with went down to
the ferri came up again by the rue de sein and the red cross but
noth absolut noth thi chase wa howev advantag to
him in on sens for in proport as the perspir broke from hi
forehead hi heart began to cool
he began to reflect upon the event that had pass thei were numer
and inauspici it wa scarc eleven oclock in the morn and
yet thi morn had alreadi brought him into disgrac with m de
trvill who could not fail to think the manner in which dartagnan
had left him a littl cavali
besid thi he had drawn upon himself two good duel with two men
each capabl of kill three dartagnanswith two musket in
short with two of those be whom he esteem so greatli that he
place them in hi mind and heart abov all other men
the outlook wa sad sure of be kill by atho it mai easili be
understood that the young man wa not veri uneasi about portho as
hope howev is the last thing extinguish in the heart of man he
finish by hope that he might surviv even though with terribl
wound in both these duel and in case of surviv he made the
follow reprehens upon hi own conduct
what a madcap i wa and what a stupid fellow i am that brave and
unfortun atho wa wound on that veri shoulder against which i
must run head foremost like a ram the onli thing that astonish me
is that he did not strike me dead at onc he had good caus to do so
the pain i gave him must have been atroci as to porthosoh as to
portho faith that a droll affair
and in spite of himself the young man began to laugh aloud look
round carefulli howev to see that hi solitari laugh without a
caus in the ey of passersbi offend no on
as to portho that is certainli droll but i am not the less a giddi
fool ar peopl to be run against without warn no and have i ani
right to go and peep under their cloak to see what is not there he
would have pardon me he would certainli have pardon me if i had
not said anyth to him about that curs baldricin ambigu word
it is true but rather drolli ambigu ah curs gascon that i am i
get from on hobbl into anoth friend dartagnan continu he
speak to himself with all the amen that he thought due himself
if you escap of which there is not much chanc i would advis you
to practic perfect polit for the futur you must henceforth be
admir and quot as a model of it to be oblig and polit doe not
necessarili make a man a coward look at arami now arami is
mild and grace personifi well did anybodi ever dream of call
arami a coward no certainli not and from thi moment i will
endeavor to model myself after him ah that strang here he is
dartagnan walk and soliloqu had arriv within a few step
of the htel darguillon and in front of that htel perceiv arami
chat gaili with three gentlemen but as he had not forgotten that
it wa in presenc of thi young man that m de trvill had been so
angri in the morn and as a wit of the rebuk the musket had
receiv wa not like to be at all agreeabl he pretend not to see
him dartagnan on the contrari quit full of hi plan of
concili and courtesi approach the young men with a profound
bow accompani by a most graciou smile all four besid
immedi broke off their convers
dartagnan wa not so dull as not to perceiv that he wa on too mani
but he wa not suffici broken into the fashion of the gai world
to know how to extric himself gallantli from a fals posit like
that of a man who begin to mingl with peopl he is scarc
acquaint with and in a convers that doe not concern him he wa
seek in hi mind then for the least awkward mean of retreat when
he remark that arami had let hi handkerchief fall and by mistak
no doubt had place hi foot upon it thi appear to be a favor
opportun to repair hi intrus he stoop and with the most
graciou air he could assum drew the handkerchief from under the foot
of the musket in spite of the effort the latter made to detain it
and hold it out to him said i believ monsieur that thi is a
handkerchief you would be sorri to lose
the handkerchief wa inde richli embroid and had a coronet and
arm at on of it corner arami blush excess and snatch
rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon
ah ah cri on of the guard will you persist in sai most
discreet arami that you ar not on good term with madam de
boistraci when that graciou ladi ha the kind to lend you on of
her handkerchief
arami dart at dartagnan on of those look which inform a man that
he ha acquir a mortal enemi then resum hi mild air you ar
deceiv gentlemen said he thi handkerchief is not mine and i
cannot fanci why monsieur ha taken it into hi head to offer it to me
rather than to on of you and as a proof of what i sai here is mine
in my pocket
so sai he pull out hi own handkerchief likewis a veri eleg
handkerchief and of fine cambricthough cambric wa dear at the
periodbut a handkerchief without embroideri and without arm onli
ornament with a singl cipher that of it proprietor
thi time dartagnan wa not hasti he perceiv hi mistak but the
friend of arami were not at all convinc by hi denial and on of
them address the young musket with affect serious if it
were as you pretend it is said he i should be forc my dear
arami to reclaim it myself for as you veri well know boistraci is
an intim friend of mine and i cannot allow the properti of hi wife
to be sport as a trophi
you make the demand badli repli arami and while acknowledg
the justic of your reclam i refus it on account of the form
the fact is hazard dartagnan timidli i did not see the
handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur arami he had hi foot
upon it that is all and i thought from have hi foot upon it the
handkerchief wa hi
and you were deceiv my dear sir repli arami coldli veri
littl sensibl to the repar then turn toward that on of the
guard who had declar himself the friend of boistraci besid
continu he i have reflect my dear intim of boistraci that i
am not less tenderli hi friend than you can possibl be so that
decidedli thi handkerchief is as like to have fallen from your
pocket as mine
no upon my honor cri hi majesti guardsman
you ar about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word and then it
will be pretti evid that on of us will have li now here
montaran we will do better than thatlet each take a half
of the handkerchief
ye
perfectli just cri the other two guardsmen the judgment of king
solomon arami you certainli ar full of wisdom
the young men burst into a laugh and as mai be suppos the affair
had no other sequel in a moment or two the convers ceas and
the three guardsmen and the musket after have cordial shaken
hand separ the guardsmen go on wai and arami anoth
now is my time to make peac with thi gallant man said dartagnan
to himself have stood on on side dure the whole of the latter
part of the convers and with thi good feel draw near to
arami who wa depart without pai ani attent to him
monsieur said he you will excus me i hope
ah monsieur interrupt arami permit me to observ to you that
you have not act in thi affair as a gallant man ought
what monsieur cri dartagnan and do you suppos
i suppos monsieur that you ar not a fool and that you knew veri
well although come from gasconi that peopl do not tread upon
handkerchief without a reason what the devil pari is not pave with
cambric
monsieur you act wrongli in endeavor to mortifi me said
dartagnan in whom the natur quarrelsom spirit began to speak more
loudli than hi pacif resolut i am from gasconi it is true
and sinc you know it there is no occas to tell you that gascon
ar not veri patient so that when thei have beg to be excus onc
were it even for a folli thei ar convinc that thei have done
alreadi at least as much again as thei ought to have done
monsieur what i sai to you about the matter said arami is not
for the sake of seek a quarrel thank god i am not a bravo and
be a musket but for a time i onli fight when i am forc to do
so and alwai with great repugn but thi time the affair is
seriou for here is a ladi compromis by you
by us you mean cri dartagnan
why did you so maladroitli restor me the handkerchief
why did you so awkwardli let it fall
i have said monsieur and i repeat that the handkerchief did not
fall from my pocket
and therebi you have li twice monsieur for i saw it fall
ah you take it with that tone do you master gascon well i will
teach you how to behav yourself

there i will indic to you the best place and time
the two young men bow and separ arami ascend the street
which led to the luxembourg while dartagnan perceiv the appoint
hour wa approach took the road to the carmesdeschaux sai to
himself decidedli i cant draw back but at least if i am kill i

ordinari man therefor while repeat to himself that hi death wa
inevit he did not make up hi mind to die quietli as on less
courag and less restrain might have done in hi place he
reflect upon the differ charact of those with whom he wa go
to fight and began to view hi situat more clearli he hope by
mean of loyal excus to make a friend of atho whose lordli air and
auster bear pleas him much he flatter himself he should be
abl to frighten portho with the adventur of the baldric which he
might if not kill upon the spot relat to everybodi a recit
which well manag would cover portho with ridicul as to the

should be abl to get so far he determin to dispatch him in good
style or at least by hit him in the face as csar recommend hi
soldier do to those of pompei to damag forev the beauti of which
he wa so proud
in addit to thi dartagnan possess that invinc stock of
resolut which the counsel of hi father had implant in hi heart
endur noth from anyon but the king the cardin and monsieur de
trvill he flew then rather than walk toward the convent of the

a sort of build without a window surround by barren fieldsan
accessori to the preauxclerc and which wa gener emploi as the
place for the duel of men who had no time to lose
when dartagnan arriv in sight of the bare spot of ground which
extend along the foot of the monasteri atho had been wait about
five minut and twelv oclock wa strike he wa then as
punctual as the samaritan woman and the most rigor casuist with
regard to duel could have noth to sai
atho who still suffer grievous from hi wound though it had been
dress anew by m de trvill surgeon wa seat on a post and

the secret might be guard it would be known i sai that we were to
fight and our combat would be prevent i think these fellow will

doubtless ar you not awar that we ar never seen on without the
other and that we ar call among the musket and the guard at
court and in the citi atho portho and arami or the three
insepar and yet as you come from dax or pau
from tarb said dartagnan
it is probabl you ar ignor of thi littl fact said atho
my faith repli dartagnan you ar well name gentlemen and my
adventur if it should make ani nois will prove at least that your
union is not found upon contrast
in the meantim portho had come up wave hi hand to atho and then

atho whose keen ey lost noth perceiv a faintli sly smile pass
over the lip of the young gascon as he repli we had a short
discuss upon dress
and you arami ask atho
oh our is a theolog quarrel repli arami make a sign to
dartagnan to keep secret the caus of their duel
atho inde saw a second smile on the lip of dartagnan
inde said atho

the gascon
decidedli thi is a clever fellow murmur atho
and now you ar assembl gentlemen said dartagnan permit me to
offer you my apolog
at thi word apolog a cloud pass over the brow of atho a
haughti smile curl the lip of portho and a neg sign wa the
repli of arami
you do not understand me gentlemen said dartagnan throw up hi
head the sharp and bold line of which were at the moment gild by a
bright rai of the sun i ask to be excus in case i should not be
abl to discharg my debt to all three for monsieur atho ha the
right to kill me first which must much diminish the facevalu of your
bill monsieur portho and render your almost null monsieur arami
and now gentlemen i repeat excus me but on that account onli
andon guard
at these word with the most gallant air possibl dartagnan drew hi
sword
the blood had mount to the head of dartagnan and at that moment he
would have drawn hi sword against all the musket in the kingdom as
willingli as he now did against atho portho and arami
it wa a quarter past middai the sun wa in it zenith and the spot
chosen for the scene of the duel wa expos to it full ardor
it is veri hot said atho draw hi sword in it turn and yet i
cannot take off my doublet for i just now felt my wound begin to bleed
again and i should not like to annoi monsieur with the sight of blood
which he ha not drawn from me himself
that is true monsieur repli dartagnan and whether drawn by
myself or anoth i assur you i shall alwai view with regret the
blood of so brave a gentleman i will therefor fight in my doublet
like yourself
come come enough of such compliment cri portho rememb we
ar wait for our turn
speak for yourself when you ar inclin to utter such incongru
interrupt arami for my part i think what thei sai is veri well
said and quit worthi of two gentlemen
when you pleas monsieur said atho put himself on guard
i wait your order said dartagnan cross sword
but scarc had the two rapier clash when a compani of the guard
of hi emin command by m de jussac turn the corner of the
convent
the cardin guard cri arami and portho at the same time
sheath your sword gentlemen sheath your sword
but it wa too late the two combat had been seen in a posit
which left no doubt of their intent
halloo cri jussac advanc toward them and make a sign to hi
men to do so likewis halloo musket fight here ar you and
the edict what is becom of them

rancor for jussac wa on of the aggressor of the preced dai if
we were to see you fight i can assur you that we would make no
effort to prevent you leav us alon then and you will enjoi a
littl amus without cost to yourselv
gentlemen said jussac it is with great regret that i pronounc the
thing imposs duti befor everyth sheath then if you pleas
and follow us
monsieur said arami parodi jussac it would afford us great
pleasur to obei your polit invit if it depend upon ourselv
but unfortun the thing is impossiblemonsieur de trvill ha
forbidden it pass on your wai then it is the best thing to do
thi railleri exasper jussac we will charg upon you then said
he if you disobei
there ar five of them said atho half aloud and we ar but
three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my
part i declar i will never appear again befor the captain as a
conquer man
atho portho and arami instantli drew near on anoth while
jussac drew up hi soldier
thi short interv wa suffici to determin dartagnan on the part
he wa to take it wa on of those event which decid the life of a
man it wa a choic between the king and the cardinalth choic made
it must be persist in to fight that wa to disobei the law that
wa to risk hi head that wa to make at on blow an enemi of a
minist more power than the king himself all thi the young man
perceiv and yet to hi prais we speak it he did not hesit a
second turn toward atho and hi friend gentlemen said he
allow me to correct your word if you pleas you said you were but
three but it appear to me we ar four
but you ar not on of us said portho
that true repli dartagnan i have not the uniform but i have

but all three reflect upon the youth of dartagnan and dread hi

a boi resum atho and yet it will not be the less said we were
four men

we ar about to have the honor of charg you repli arami
lift hi hat with on hand and draw hi sword with the other
ah you resist do you cri jussac
sblood doe that astonish you
and the nine combat rush upon each other with a furi which
howev did not exclud a certain degre of method
atho fix upon a certain cahusac a favorit of the cardin
portho had bicarat and arami found himself oppos to two
adversari as to dartagnan he sprang toward jussac himself
the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through hi
sidenot from fear god be thank he had not the shade of it but
with emul he fought like a furiou tiger turn ten time round
hi adversari and chang hi ground and hi guard twenti time
jussac wa as wa then said a fine blade and had had much practic
nevertheless it requir all hi skill to defend himself against an
adversari who activ and energet depart everi instant from
receiv rule attack him on all side at onc and yet parri
like a man who had the greatest respect for hi own epidermi
thi contest at length exhaust jussac patienc furiou at be
held in check by on whom he had consid a boi he becam warm and
began to make mistak dartagnan who though want in practic had
a sound theori redoubl hi agil jussac anxiou to put an end to
thi spring forward aim a terribl thrust at hi adversari but
the latter parri it and while jussac wa recov himself glide
like a serpent beneath hi blade and pass hi sword through hi
bodi jussac fell like a dead mass
dartagnan then cast an anxiou and rapid glanc over the field of
battl
arami had kill on of hi adversari but the other press him
warmli nevertheless arami wa in a good situat and abl to
defend himself
bicarat and portho had just made counterhit portho had receiv a
thrust through hi arm and bicarat on through hi thigh but neither
of these two wound wa seriou and thei onli fought more earnestli
atho wound anew by cahusac becam evid paler but did not
give wai a foot he onli chang hi sword hand and fought with hi
left hand
accord to the law of duel at that period dartagnan wa at
liberti to assist whom he pleas while he wa endeavor to find out
which of hi companion stood in greatest need he caught a glanc from
atho the glanc wa of sublim eloqu atho would have di
rather than appeal for help but he could look and with that look ask
assist dartagnan interpret it with a terribl bound he sprang
to the side of cahusac cry to me monsieur guardsman i will slai
you
cahusac turn it wa time for atho whose great courag alon
support him sank upon hi knee
sblood cri he to dartagnan do not kill him young man i beg
of you i have an old affair to settl with him when i am cure and
sound again disarm him onlymak sure of hi sword that it veri
well done
the exclam wa drawn from atho by see the sword of cahusac fly
twenti pace from him dartagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the
same instant the on to recov the other to obtain the sword but
dartagnan be the more activ reach it first and place hi foot
upon it
cahusac immedi ran to the guardsman whom arami had kill seiz
hi rapier and return toward dartagnan but on hi wai he met
atho who dure hi relief which dartagnan had procur him had
recov hi breath and who for fear that dartagnan would kill hi
enemi wish to resum the fight
dartagnan perceiv that it would be disoblig atho not to leav
him alon and in a few minut cahusac fell with a sword thrust
through hi throat
at the same instant arami place hi sword point on the breast of hi
fallen enemi and forc him to ask for merci
there onli then remain portho and bicarat portho made a thousand
flourish ask bicarat what oclock it could be and offer him
hi compliment upon hi brother have just obtain a compani in
the regiment of navarr but jest as he might he gain noth
bicarat wa on of those iron men who never fell dead
nevertheless it wa necessari to finish the watch might come up and
take all the combat wound or not royalist or cardinalist
atho arami and dartagnan surround bicarat and requir him to
surrend though alon against all and with a wound in hi thigh
bicarat wish to hold out but jussac who had risen upon hi elbow
cri out to him to yield bicarat wa a gascon as dartagnan wa he
turn a deaf ear and content himself with laugh and between two
parri find time to point to a spot of earth with hi sword
here cri he parodi a vers of the bibl here will bicarat
die for i onli am left and thei seek my life
but there ar four against you leav off i command you
ah if you command me that anoth thing said bicarat as you
ar my command it is my duti to obei and spring backward he
broke hi sword across hi knee to avoid the necess of surrend
it threw the piec over the convent wall and cross hi arm
whistl a cardinalist air
braveri is alwai respect even in an enemi the musket salut
bicarat with their sword and return them to their sheath
dartagnan did the same then assist by bicarat the onli on left
stand thei bore jussac cahusac and on of aramiss adversari
who wa onli wound under the porch of the convent the fourth as we
have said wa dead thei then rang the bell and carri awai four
sword out of five thei took their road intox with joi toward
the htel of m de trvill
thei walk arm in arm occupi the whole width of the street and
take in everi musket thei met so that in the end it becam a
triumphal march the heart of dartagnan swam in delirium he march
between atho and portho press them tenderli
if i am not yet a musket said he to hi new friend as he pass
through the gatewai of m de trvill htel at least i have enter
upon my apprenticeship havent i
chapter vi
hi majesti king loui xiii
thi affair made a great nois m de trvill scold hi musket

lost in gain the king m de trvill hasten to report himself at
the louvr it wa alreadi too late the king wa closet with the
cardin and m de trvill wa inform that the king wa busi and
could not receiv him at that moment in the even m de trvill
attend the king game tabl the king wa win and as he wa
veri avarici he wa in an excel humor perceiv m de
trvill at a distanc
come here monsieur captain said he come here that i mai growl at
you do you know that hi emin ha been make fresh complaint
against your musket and that with so much emot that thi
even hi emin is indispos ah these musket of your ar
veri devilsfellow to be hang
no sire repli trvill who saw at the first glanc how thing
would go on the contrari thei ar good creatur as meek as lamb
and have but on desir ill be their warranti and that is that their
sword mai never leav their scabbard but in your majesti servic
but what ar thei to do the guard of monsieur the cardin ar
forev seek quarrel with them and for the honor of the corp
even the poor young men ar oblig to defend themselv
listen to monsieur de trvill said the king listen to him would
not on sai he wa speak of a religi commun in truth my dear
captain i have a great mind to take awai your commiss and give it
to mademoisel de chemerault to whom i promis an abbei but dont
fanci that i am go to take you on your bare word i am call loui
the just monsieur de trvill and by and by by and by we will see
ah sire it is becaus i confid in that justic that i shall wait
patient and quietli the good pleasur of your majesti
wait then monsieur wait said the king i will not detain you
long
in fact fortun chang and as the king began to lose what he had
won he wa not sorri to find an excus for plai charlemagneif we
mai us a game phrase of whose origin we confess our ignor the
king therefor aros a minut after and put the monei which lai
befor him into hi pocket the major part of which aros from hi
win la vieuvil said he take my place i must speak to
monsieur de trvill on an affair of import ah i had eighti loui
befor me put down the same sum so that thei who have lost mai have
noth to complain of justic befor everyth
then turn toward m de trvill and walk with him toward the
embrasur of a window well monsieur continu he you sai it is
hi emin guard who have sought a quarrel with your musket
ye sire as thei alwai do
and how did the thing happen let us see for you know my dear
captain a judg must hear both side
good lord in the most simpl and natur manner possibl three of my
best soldier whom your majesti know by name and whose devoted
you have more than onc appreci and who have i dare affirm to the
king hi servic much at heartthre of my best soldier i sai
atho portho and arami had made a parti of pleasur with a young
fellow from gasconi whom i had introduc to them the same morn
the parti wa to take place at st germain i believ and thei had
appoint to meet at the carmesdeschaux when thei were disturb by
de jussac cahusac bicarat and two other guardsmen who certainli did
not go there in such a numer compani without some ill intent
against the edict
ah ah you inclin me to think so said the king there is no doubt
thei went thither to fight themselv
i do not accus them sire but i leav your majesti to judg what
five arm men could possibl be go to do in such a desert place
as the neighborhood of the convent de carm
ye you ar right trvill you ar right
then upon see my musket thei chang their mind and forgot
their privat hatr for partisan hatr for your majesti cannot be
ignor that the musket who belong to the king and nobodi but the
king ar the natur enemi of the guardsmen who belong to the
cardin
ye trvill ye said the king in a melancholi tone and it is
veri sad believ me to see thu two parti in franc two head to
royalti but all thi will come to an end trvill will come to an
end you sai then that the guardsmen sought a quarrel with the
musket
i sai that it is probabl that thing have fallen out so but i will
not swear to it sire you know how difficult it is to discov the
truth and unless a man be endow with that admir instinct which
caus loui xiii to be name the just
you ar right trvill but thei were not alon your musket
thei had a youth with them
ye sire and on wound man so that three of the king
musketeerson of whom wa woundedand a youth not onli maintain
their ground against five of the most terribl of the cardin
guardsmen but absolut brought four of them to earth
why thi is a victori cri the king all radiant a complet
victori
ye sire as complet as that of the bridg of ce
four men on of them wound and a youth sai you
on hardli a young man but who howev behav himself so admir
on thi occas that i will take the liberti of recommend him to
your majesti
how doe he call himself
dartagnan sire he is the son of on of my oldest friendsth son of
a man who serv under the king your father of gloriou memori in the
civil war
and you sai thi young man behav himself well tell me how
trvilley know how i delight in account of war and fight
and loui xiii twist hi mustach proudli place hi hand upon hi
hip
sire resum trvill as i told you monsieur dartagnan is littl
more than a boi and as he ha not the honor of be a musket he
wa dress as a citizen the guard of the cardin perceiv hi
youth and that he did not belong to the corp invit him to retir
befor thei attack
so you mai plainli see trvill interrupt the king it wa thei
who attack
that is true sire there can be no more doubt on that head thei
call upon him then to retir but he answer that he wa a musket
at heart entir devot to your majesti and that therefor he would
remain with messieur the musket
brave young man murmur the king
well he did remain with them and your majesti ha in him so firm a
champion that it wa he who gave jussac the terribl sword thrust which
ha made the cardin so angri
he who wound jussac cri the king he a boi trvill that
imposs
it is as i have the honor to relat it to your majesti
jussac on of the first swordsmen in the kingdom
well sire for onc he found hi master
i will see thi young man trvillei will see him and if anyth
can be donewel we will make it our busi
when will your majesti deign to receiv him
tomorrow at middai trvill
shall i bring him alon
no bring me all four togeth i wish to thank them all at onc
devot men ar so rare trvill by the back staircas it is useless
to let the cardin know
ye sire
you understand trvillean edict is still an edict it is forbidden
to fight after all
but thi encount sire is quit out of the ordinari condit of a
duel it is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the
cardin guardsmen against my three musket and monsieur
dartagnan
that is true said the king but never mind trvill come still by
the back staircas
trvill smile but as it wa inde someth to have prevail upon
thi child to rebel against hi master he salut the king
respectfulli and with thi agreement took leav of him
that even the three musket were inform of the honor accord
them as thei had long been acquaint with the king thei were not
much excit but dartagnan with hi gascon imagin saw in it
hi futur fortun and pass the night in golden dream by eight
oclock in the morn he wa at the apart of atho
dartagnan found the musket dress and readi to go out as the hour
to wait upon the king wa not till twelv he had made a parti with
portho and arami to plai a game at tenni in a tenni court situat
near the stabl of the luxembourg atho invit dartagnan to follow
them and although ignor of the game which he had never plai he
accept not know what to do with hi time from nine oclock in the
morn as it then scarc wa till twelv
the two musket were alreadi there and were plai togeth
atho who wa veri expert in all bodili exercis pass with
dartagnan to the opposit side and challeng them but at the first
effort he made although he plai with hi left hand he found that
hi wound wa yet too recent to allow of such exert dartagnan
remain therefor alon and as he declar he wa too ignor of
the game to plai it regularli thei onli continu give ball to on
anoth without count but on of these ball launch by portho
herculean hand pass so close to dartagnan face that he thought
that if instead of pass near it had hit him hi audienc would
have been probabl lost as it would have been imposs for him to
present himself befor the king now as upon thi audienc in hi
gascon imagin depend hi futur life he salut arami and
portho polit declar that he would not resum the game until he
should be prepar to plai with them on more equal term and went and
took hi place near the cord and in the galleri
unfortun for dartagnan among the spectat wa on of hi
emin guardsmen who still irrit by the defeat of hi
companion which had happen onli the dai befor had promis
himself to seiz the first opportun of aveng it he believ thi
opportun wa now come and address hi neighbor it is not
astonish that that young man should be afraid of a ball for he is
doubtless a musket apprentic
dartagnan turn round as if a serpent had stung him and fix hi
ey intens upon the guardsman who had just made thi insol
speech
pardieu resum the latter twist hi mustach look at me as
long as you like my littl gentleman i have said what i have said
and as sinc that which you have said is too clear to requir ani
explan repli dartagnan in a low voic i beg you to follow
me
and when ask the guardsman with the same jeer air
at onc if you pleas
and you know who i am without doubt
i i am complet ignor nor doe it much disquiet me
your in the wrong there for if you knew my name perhap you would
not be so press
what is your name
bernajoux at your servic
well then monsieur bernajoux said dartagnan tranquilli i will
wait for you at the door
go monsieur i will follow you
do not hurri yourself monsieur lest it be observ that we go out
togeth you must be awar that for our undertak compani would be
in the wai
that true said the guardsman astonish that hi name had not
produc more effect upon the young man
inde the name of bernajoux wa known to all the world dartagnan
alon except perhap for it wa on of those which figur most
frequent in the daili brawl which all the edict of the cardin
could not repress
portho and arami were so engag with their game and atho wa
watch them with so much attent that thei did not even perceiv
their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of hi
emin stop outsid the door an instant after the guardsman
descend in hi turn as dartagnan had no time to lose on account of
the audienc of the king which wa fix for middai he cast hi ey
around and see that the street wa empti said to hi adversari
my faith it is fortun for you although your name is bernajoux to
have onli to deal with an apprentic musket never mind be content
i will do my best on guard
but said he whom dartagnan thu provok it appear to me that
thi place is badli chosen and that we should be better behind the
abbei st germain or in the prauxclerc
what you sai is full of sens repli dartagnan but unfortun
i have veri littl time to spare have an appoint at twelv
precis on guard then monsieur on guard
bernajoux wa not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice in
an instant hi sword glitter in hi hand and he sprang upon hi
adversari whom thank to hi great youth he hope to
intimid
but dartagnan had on the preced dai serv hi apprenticeship
fresh sharpen by hi victori full of hope of futur favor he wa
resolv not to recoil a step so the two sword were cross close to
the hilt and as dartagnan stood firm it wa hi adversari who made
the retreat step but dartagnan seiz the moment at which in thi
movement the sword of bernajoux deviat from the line he freed hi
weapon made a lung and touch hi adversari on the shoulder
dartagnan immedi made a step backward and rais hi sword but
bernajoux cri out that it wa noth and rush blindli upon him
absolut spit himself upon dartagnan sword as howev he did
not fall as he did not declar himself conquer but onli broke awai
toward the htel of m de la trmouill in whose servic he had a
rel dartagnan wa ignor of the serious of the last wound
hi adversari had receiv and press him warmli without doubt
would soon have complet hi work with a third blow when the nois
which aros from the street be heard in the tenni court two of the
friend of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchang some
word with dartagnan rush sword in hand from the court and fell
upon the conqueror but atho portho and arami quickli appear in
their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attack their young
companion drove them back bernajoux now fell and as the guardsmen
were onli two against four thei began to cry to the rescu the
htel de la trmouill at these cri all who were in the htel
rush out and fell upon the four companion who on their side cri
aloud to the rescu musket
thi cry wa gener heed for the musket were known to be
enemi of the cardin and were belov on account of the hatr thei
bore to hi emin thu the soldier of other compani than those
which belong to the red duke as arami had call him often took
part with the king musket in these quarrel of three guardsmen
of the compani of m dessessart who were pass two came to the
assist of the four companion while the other ran toward the htel
of m de trvill cry to the rescu musket to the rescu
as usual thi htel wa full of soldier of thi compani who hasten
to the succor of their comrad the mle becam gener but
strength wa on the side of the musket the cardin guard and
m de la trmouill peopl retreat into the htel the door of
which thei close just in time to prevent their enemi from enter
with them as to the wound man he had been taken in at onc and as
we have said in a veri bad state
excit wa at it height among the musket and their alli and
thei even began to deliber whether thei should not set fire to the
htel to punish the insol of m de la trmouill domest in
dare to make a sorti upon the king musket the proposit
had been made and receiv with enthusiasm when fortun eleven
oclock struck dartagnan and hi companion rememb their
audienc and as thei would veri much have regret that such an
opportun should be lost thei succeed in calm their friend

where he wa go thei told me to st germain
he is beforehand with us said m de trvill gentlemen i will see
the king thi even but as to you i do not advis you to risk do

thi advic wa too reason and moreov came from a man who knew
the king too well to allow the four young men to disput it m de
trvill recommend everyon to return home and wait for new

make the complaint he sent on of hi servant to m de la
trmouill with a letter in which he beg of him to eject the
cardin guardsmen from hi hous and to reprimand hi peopl for
their audac in make sorti against the king musket but m
de la trmouillealreadi prejud by hi esquir whose rel as
we alreadi know bernajoux wasrepli that it wa neither for m de
trvill nor the musket to complain but on the contrari for him
whose peopl the musket had assault and whose htel thei had
endeavor to burn now as the debat between these two nobl might
last a long time each becom natur more firm in hi own
opinion m de trvill thought of an expedi which might termin
it quietli thi wa to go himself to m de la trmouill
he repair therefor immedi to hi htel and caus himself to
be announc
the two nobl salut each other polit for if no friendship
exist between them there wa at least esteem both were men of
courag and honor and as m de la trmouillea protest and see
the king seldomwa of no parti he did not in gener carri ani bia
into hi social relat thi time howev hi address although
polit wa cooler than usual
monsieur said m de trvill we fanci that we have each caus to
complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up thi
affair
i have no object repli m de la trmouill but i warn you
that i am well inform and all the fault is with your musket
you ar too just and reason a man monsieur said trvill not
to accept the propos i am about to make to you

well monsieur let us go to him let us adjur him in the name of
the god befor whom he must perhap appear to speak the truth i will
take him for judg in hi own caus monsieur and will believ what he

m de la trmouill reflect for an instant then as it wa difficult
to suggest a more reason propos he agre to it
both descend to the chamber in which the wound man lai the latter
on see these two nobl lord who came to visit him endeavor to
rais himself up in hi bed but he wa too weak and exhaust by the
effort he fell back again almost senseless
m de la trmouill approach him and made him inhal some salt
which recal him to life then m de trvill unwil that it
should be thought that he had influenc the wound man request m
de la trmouill to interrog him himself
that happen which m de trvill had foreseen place between life
and death as bernajoux wa he had no idea for a moment of conceal
the truth and he describ to the two nobl the affair exactli as it
had pass
thi wa all that m de trvill want he wish bernajoux a speedi
convalesc took leav of m de la trmouill return to hi

though it mai easili be understood therefor that the convers
dure the whole of dinner turn upon the two check that hi
emin guardsmen had receiv now as dartagnan had been the hero
of these two fight it wa upon him that all the felicit fell

the king wave hi hand to trvill who left him and rejoin the
musket whom he found share the forti pistol with dartagnan
the cardin as hi majesti had said wa realli furiou so furiou
that dure eight dai he absent himself from the king game
tabl thi did not prevent the king from be as complac to him as
possibl whenev he met him or from ask in the kindest tone
well monsieur cardin how fare it with that poor jussac and that
poor bernajoux of your
chapter vii
the interior of the musket
when dartagnan wa out of the louvr and consult hi friend upon
the us he had best make of hi share of the forti pistol atho
advis him to order a good repast at the pommedepin portho to
engag a lackei and arami to provid himself with a suitabl
mistress
the repast wa carri into effect that veri dai and the lackei wait
at tabl the repast had been order by atho and the lackei
furnish by portho he wa a picard whom the gloriou musket had
pick up on the bridg tournel make ring and plash in the
water
portho pretend that thi occup wa proof of a reflect and
contempl organ and he had brought him awai without ani
other recommend the nobl carriag of thi gentleman for whom he
believ himself to be engag had won planchetthat wa the name of
the picard he felt a slight disappoint howev when he saw that
thi place wa alreadi taken by a compeer name mousqueton and when
portho signifi to him that the state of hi household though great
would not support two servant and that he must enter into the servic
of dartagnan nevertheless when he wait at the dinner given by hi
master and saw him take out a hand of gold to pai for it he
believ hi fortun made and return thank to heaven for have
thrown him into the servic of such a crsu he preserv thi
opinion even after the feast with the remnant of which he repair
hi own long abstin but when in the even he made hi master
bed the chimera of planchet fade awai the bed wa the onli on in
the apart which consist of an antechamb and a bedroom
planchet slept in the antechamb upon a coverlet taken from the bed of
dartagnan and which dartagnan from that time made shift to do
without
atho on hi part had a valet whom he had train in hi servic in a
thoroughli peculiar fashion and who wa name grimaud he wa veri
taciturn thi worthi signor be it understood we ar speak of
atho dure the five or six year that he had live in the strictest
intimaci with hi companion portho and arami thei could rememb
have often seen him smile but had never heard him laugh hi word
were brief and express convei all that wa meant and no more
no embellish no embroideri no arabesqu hi convers wa a
matter of fact without a singl romanc
although atho wa scarc thirti year old and wa of great person
beauti and intellig of mind no on knew whether he had ever had a
mistress he never spoke of women he certainli did not prevent other
from speak of them befor him although it wa easi to perceiv that
thi kind of convers in which he onli mingl by bitter word and
misanthrop remark wa veri disagre to him hi reserv hi
rough and hi silenc made almost an old man of him he had then
in order not to disturb hi habit accustom grimaud to obei him upon
a simpl gestur or upon a simpl movement of hi lip he never spoke
to him except under the most extraordinari occas
sometim grimaud who fear hi master as he did fire while
entertain a strong attach to hi person and a great vener
for hi talent believ he perfectli understood what he want flew
to execut the order receiv and did precis the contrari atho
then shrug hi shoulder and without put himself in a passion
thrash grimaud on these dai he spoke a littl
portho as we have seen had a charact exactli opposit to that of
atho he not onli talk much but he talk loudli littl care we
must render him that justic whether anybodi listen to him or not
he talk for the pleasur of talk and for the pleasur of hear
himself talk he spoke upon all subject except the scienc alleg
in thi respect the inveter hatr he had born to scholar from hi
childhood he had not so nobl an air as atho and the commenc of
their intimaci often render him unjust toward that gentleman whom he
endeavor to eclips by hi splendid dress but with hi simpl
musket uniform and noth but the manner in which he threw back
hi head and advanc hi foot atho instantli took the place which
wa hi due and consign the ostentati portho to the second rank
portho consol himself by fill the antechamb of m de trvill
and the guardroom of the louvr with the account of hi love scrape
after have pass from profession ladi to militari ladi from
the lawyer dame to the baro there wa question of noth less
with portho than a foreign princess who wa enorm fond of him
an old proverb sai like master like man let us pass then from
the valet of atho to the valet of portho from grimaud to mousqueton
mousqueton wa a norman whose pacif name of bonifac hi master had
chang into the infinit more sonor name of mousqueton he had
enter the servic of portho upon condit that he should onli be
cloth and lodg though in a handsom manner but he claim two
hour a dai to himself consecr to an employ which would
provid for hi other want portho agre to the bargain the thing
suit him wonderfulli well he had doublet cut out of hi old cloth
and castoff cloak for mousqueton and thank to a veri intellig
tailor who made hi cloth look as good as new by turn them and
whose wife wa suspect of wish to make portho descend from hi
aristocrat habit mousqueton made a veri good figur when attend
on hi master
as for arami of whom we believ we have suffici explain the
charactera charact which like that of hi companion we shall be
abl to follow in it developmenthi lackei wa call bazin thank
to the hope which hi master entertain of somedai enter into
order he wa alwai cloth in black as becam the servant of a
churchman he wa a berrichon thirtyf or forti year old mild
peaceabl sleek emploi the leisur hi master left him in the
perus of piou work provid rigor for two a dinner of few
dish but excel for the rest he wa dumb blind and deaf and
of unimpeach fidel
and now that we ar acquaint superfici at least with the
master and the valet let us pass on to the dwell occupi by

preciou stone might be worth two hundr pistol and which
nevertheless in hi moment of greatest distress atho had never
pledg or offer for sale it had long been an object of ambit for
portho portho would have given ten year of hi life to possess thi
sword
on dai when he had an appoint with a duchess he endeavor even
to borrow it of atho atho without sai anyth empti hi

chapter viii
concern a court intrigu
in the meantim the forti pistol of king loui xiii like all other
thing of thi world after have had a begin had an end and
after thi end our four companion began to be somewhat embarrass at
first atho support the associ for a time with hi own mean
portho succeed him and thank to on of those disappear to
which he wa accustom he wa abl to provid for the want of all
for a fortnight at last it becam aramiss turn who perform it with
a good grace and who succeededa he said by sell some theolog
booksin procur a few pistol
then as thei had been accustom to do thei had recours to m de
trvill who made some advanc on their pai but these advanc could
not go far with three musket who were alreadi much in arrear and a
guardsman who as yet had no pai at all
at length when thei found thei were like to be realli in want thei
got togeth as a last effort eight or ten pistol with which
portho went to the game tabl unfortun he wa in a bad vein
he lost all togeth with twentyf pistol for which he had given
hi word
then the inconveni becam distress the hungri friend follow by
their lackei were seen haunt the quai and guard room pick up
among their friend abroad all the dinner thei could meet with for
accord to the advic of arami it wa prudent to sow repast right
and left in prosper in order to reap a few in time of need
atho wa invit four time and each time took hi friend and their
lackei with him portho had six occas and contriv in the same
manner that hi friend should partak of them arami had eight of
them he wa a man as must have been alreadi perceiv who made but
littl nois and yet wa much sought after
as to dartagnan who as yet knew nobodi in the capit he onli found
on chocol breakfast at the hous of a priest of hi own provinc
and on dinner at the hous of a cornet of the guard he took hi armi
to the priest where thei devour as much provis as would have
last him for two month and to the cornet who perform wonder
but as planchet said peopl do not eat at onc for all time even
when thei eat a good deal
dartagnan thu felt himself humili in have onli procur on
meal and a half for hi companionsa the breakfast at the priest
could onli be count as half a repastin return for the feast which
atho portho and arami had procur him he fanci himself a
burden to the societi forget in hi perfectli juvenil good faith
that he had fed thi societi for a month and he set hi mind activ
to work he reflect that thi coalit of four young brave
enterpris and activ men ought to have some other object than
swagger walk fenc lesson and practic joke more or less
witti
in fact four men such as thei werefour men devot to on anoth
from their purs to their live four men alwai support on

turn toward a singl pointmust inevit either subterran
in open dai by mine in the trench by cun or by forc open
themselv a wai toward the object thei wish to attain howev well
it might be defend or howev distant it mai seem the onli thing
that astonish dartagnan wa that hi friend had never thought of
thi
he wa think by himself and even serious rack hi brain to
find a direct for thi singl forc four time multipli with
which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimed sought

where
in the street face your window in the embrasur of that doora man

have recogn hi man
ah thi time cri dartagnan spring to hi sword thi time
he will not escap me
draw hi sword from it scabbard he rush out of the apart on
the staircas he met atho and portho who were come to see him
thei separ and dartagnan rush between them like a dart
pah where ar you go cri the two musket in a breath
the man of meung repli dartagnan and disappear
dartagnan had more than onc relat to hi friend hi adventur with
the stranger as well as the apparit of the beauti foreign to
whom thi man had confid some import missiv
the opinion of atho wa that dartagnan had lost hi letter in the
skirmish a gentleman in hi opinionand accord to dartagnan
portrait of him the stranger must be a gentlemanwould be incap of
the base of steal a letter
portho saw noth in all thi but a love meet given by a ladi to
a cavali or by a cavali to a ladi which had been disturb by the
presenc of dartagnan and hi yellow hors
arami said that as these sort of affair were mysteri it wa
better not to fathom them
thei understood then from the few word which escap from
dartagnan what affair wa in hand and as thei thought that
overtak hi man or lose sight of him dartagnan would return to
hi room thei kept on their wai
when thei enter dartagnan chamber it wa empti the landlord
dread the consequ of the encount which wa doubtless about to
take place between the young man and the stranger had consist with
the charact he had given himself judg it prudent to decamp
chapter ix
dartagnan show himself
as atho and portho had foreseen at the expir of a half hour
dartagnan return he had again miss hi man who had disappear
as if by enchant dartagnan had run sword in hand through all
the neighbor street but had found nobodi resembl the man he
sought for then he came back to the point where perhap he ought to
have begun and that wa to knock at the door against which the
stranger had lean but thi prove uselessfor though he knock ten
or twelv time in success no on answer and some of the
neighbor who put their nose out of their window or were brought to
their door by the nois had assur him that that hous all the
open of which were tightli close had not been inhabit for six
month
while dartagnan wa run through the street and knock at door
arami had join hi companion so that on return home dartagnan
found the reunion complet
well cri the three musket all togeth on see dartagnan
enter with hi brow cover with perspir and hi counten upset
with anger
well cri he throw hi sword upon the bed thi man must be
the devil in person he ha disappear like a phantom like a shade
like a specter
do you believ in apparit ask atho of portho
i never believ in anyth i have not seen and as i never have seen
apparit i dont believ in them
the bibl said arami make our belief in them a law the ghost of
samuel appear to saul and it is an articl of faith that i should be
veri sorri to see ani doubt thrown upon portho
at all event man or devil bodi or shadow illus or realiti thi
man is born for my damnat for hi flight ha caus us to miss a
gloriou affair gentlemenan affair by which there were a hundr
pistol and perhap more to be gain
how is that cri portho and arami in a breath
as to atho faith to hi system of retic he content himself
with interrog dartagnan by a look
planchet said dartagnan to hi domest who just then insinu
hi head through the halfopen door in order to catch some fragment of
the convers go down to my landlord monsieur bonacieux and ask
him to send me half a dozen bottl of beaugenc wine i prefer that
ah ah you have credit with your landlord then ask portho
ye repli dartagnan from thi veri dai and mind if the wine
is bad we will send him to find better
we must us and not abus said arami sententi
i alwai said that dartagnan had the longest head of the four said
atho who have utter hi opinion to which dartagnan repli
with a bow immedi resum hi accustom silenc
but come what is thi about ask portho
ye said arami impart it to us my dear friend unless the honor
of ani ladi be hazard by thi confid in that case you would do
better to keep it to yourself
be satisfi repli dartagnan the honor of no on will have
caus to complain of what i have to tell
he then relat to hi friend word for word all that had pass
between him and hi host and how the man who had abduct the wife of
hi worthi landlord wa the same with whom he had had the differ at
the hostelri of the jolli miller
your affair is not bad said atho after have tast like a
connoisseur and indic by a nod of hi head that he thought the wine
good and on mai draw fifti or sixti pistol from thi good man
then there onli remain to ascertain whether these fifti or sixti
pistol ar worth the risk of four head
but observ cri dartagnan that there is a woman in the affaira
woman carri off a woman who is doubtless threaten tortur
perhap and all becaus she is faith to her mistress
bewar dartagnan bewar said arami you grow a littl too warm
in my opinion about the fate of madam bonacieux woman wa creat
for our destruct and it is from her we inherit all our miseri
at thi speech of arami the brow of atho becam cloud and he bit
hi lip
it is not madam bonacieux about whom i am anxiou cri dartagnan
but the queen whom the king abandon whom the cardin persecut
and who see the head of all her friend fall on after the other
why doe she love what we hate most in the world the spaniard and
the english
spain is her countri repli dartagnan and it is veri natur
that she should love the spanish who ar the children of the same soil
as herself as to the second reproach i have heard it said that she
doe not love the english but an englishman
well and by my faith said atho it must be acknowledg that thi
englishman is worthi of be love i never saw a man with a nobler
air than hi
without reckon that he dress as nobodi els can said portho
i wa at the louvr on the dai when he scatter hi pearl and
pardieu i pick up two that i sold for ten pistol each do you
know him arami
as well as you do gentlemen for i wa among those who seiz him in
the garden at amien into which monsieur putang the queen equerri
introduc me i wa at school at the time and the adventur appear
to me to be cruel for the king
which would not prevent me said dartagnan if i knew where the
duke of buckingham wa from take him by the hand and conduct him
to the queen were it onli to enrag the cardin and if we could find
mean to plai him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarili risk my
head in do it
and did the mercer rejoin atho tell you dartagnan that the
queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forg
letter
haberdash
she is afraid so
wait a minut then said arami
what for demand portho
go on while i endeavor to recal circumst
and now i am convinc said dartagnan that thi abduct of the
queen woman is connect with the event of which we ar speak
and perhap with the presenc of buckingham in pari
the gascon is full of idea said portho with admir
i like to hear him talk said atho hi dialect amus me
gentlemen cri arami listen to thi
listen to arami said hi three friend
yesterdai i wa at the hous of a doctor of theologi whom i sometim
consult about my studi

see her uncl and by chanc wa there yesterdai at the same time that

ah she ha a carriag then thi niec of the doctor interrupt
portho on of whose fault wa a great loos of tongu a nice
acquaint my friend
portho repli arami i have had the occas to observ to you
more than onc that you ar veri indiscreet and that is injuri to
you among the women
gentlemen gentlemen cri dartagnan who began to get a glimps of
the result of the adventur the thing is seriou let us try not to
jest if we can go on arami go on
all at onc a tall dark gentlemanjust like your dartagnan
the same perhap said he
possibl continu arami came toward me accompani by five or
six men who follow about ten pace behind him and in the politest
tone monsieur duke said he to me and you madam continu he
address the ladi on my arm
the doctor niec
hold your tongu portho said atho you ar insupport
will you enter thi carriag and that without offer the least
resist without make the least nois

he took her for the queen said dartagnan
just so repli arami
the gascon is the devil cri atho noth escap him
the fact is said portho arami is of the same height and
someth of the shape of the duke but it nevertheless appear to me
that the dress of a musket
i wore an enorm cloak said arami
in the month of juli the devil said portho is the doctor afraid
that you mai be recogn
i can comprehend that the spy mai have been deceiv by the person
but the face

oh good lord cri portho what precaut for the studi of
theologi
gentlemen gentlemen said dartagnan do not let us lose our time
in jest let us separ and let us seek the mercer wifethat is
the kei of the intrigu

protrud hi lip with contempt

majesti calcul to seek on thi occas for support so lowli
high head expos themselv from afar and the cardin is
longsight
well said portho in the first place make a bargain with the
mercer and a good bargain
that useless said dartagnan for i believ if he doe not pai
us we shall be well enough paid by anoth parti
at thi moment a sudden nois of footstep wa heard upon the stair
the door wa thrown violent open and the unfortun mercer rush
into the chamber in which the council wa held
save me gentlemen for the love of heaven save me cri he there
ar four men come to arrest me save me save me
portho and arami aros
a moment cri dartagnan make them a sign to replac in the
scabbard their halfdrawn sword it is not courag that is need it

you will leav dartagnan to act as he think proper said atho he
ha i repeat the longest head of the four and for my part i declar
that i will obei him do as you think best dartagnan

but see four musket stand and their sword by their side
thei hesit about go farther

apart and we ar all faith servant of the king and cardin

as to dartagnan he did not budg from hi apart he convert hi
chamber into an observatori from hi window he saw all the visitor
who were caught then have remov a plank from hi floor and
noth remain but a simpl ceil between him and the room
beneath in which the interrogatori were made he heard all that

said dartagnan to himself now what is it thei want to know why
thei want to know if the duke of buckingham is in pari and if he ha
had or is like to have an interview with the queen
dartagnan held onto thi idea which from what he had heard wa not
want in probabl
in the meantim the mousetrap continu in oper and likewis

difficulti from take a part in the scene that wa go on below
but i tell you that i am the mistress of the hous gentlemen i tell

the knocker had scarc sound under the hand of the young man befor
the tumult ceas step approach the door wa open and
dartagnan sword in hand rush into the room of m bonacieux the
door of which doubtless act upon by a spring close after him
then those who dwelt in bonacieux unfortun hous togeth with
the nearest neighbor heard loud cri stamp of feet clash of
sword and break of furnitur a moment after those who surpris
by thi tumult had gone to their window to learn the caus of it saw
the door open and four men cloth in black not come out of it
but fly like so mani frighten crow leav on the ground and on
the corner of the furnitur feather from their wing that is to
sai patch of their cloth and fragment of their cloak
dartagnan wa conquerorwithout much effort it must be confess for
onli on of the offic wa arm and even he defend himself for
form sake it is true that the three other had endeavor to knock
the young man down with chair stool and crockeri but two or three
scratch made by the gascon blade terrifi them ten minut
suffic for their defeat and dartagnan remain master of the field
of battl
the neighbor who had open their window with the cool peculiar
to the inhabit of pari in these time of perpetu riot and
disturb close them again as soon as thei saw the four men in
black fleetheir instinct tell them that for the time all wa over
besid it began to grow late and then as todai peopl went to bed
earli in the quarter of the luxembourg
on be left alon with mme bonacieux dartagnan turn toward her
the poor woman reclin where she had been left halffaint upon an
armchair dartagnan examin her with a rapid glanc
she wa a charm woman of twentyf or twentysix year with dark
hair blue ey and a nose slightli turn up admir teeth and a
complexion marbl with rose and opal there howev end the sign
which might have confound her with a ladi of rank the hand were
white but without delicaci the feet did not bespeak the woman of
qualiti happili dartagnan wa not yet acquaint with such niceti
while dartagnan wa examin mme bonacieux and wa as we have
said close to her he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief
which he pick up as wa hi habit and at the corner of which he
recogn the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had
nearli caus him and arami to cut each other throat
from that time dartagnan had been cautiou with respect to
handkerchief with arm on them and he therefor place in the pocket
of mme bonacieux the on he had just pick up
at that moment mme bonacieux recov her sens she open her
ey look around her with terror saw that the apart wa empti
and that she wa alon with her liber she extend her hand to
him with a smile mme bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world
ah monsieur said she you have save me permit me to thank you
madam said dartagnan i have onli done what everi gentleman would
have done in my place you ow me no thank
oh ye monsieur oh ye and i hope to prove to you that you have
not serv an ingrat but what could these men whom i at first took

a second smile almost impercept stole over the rosi lip of the
pretti young woman
but continu dartagnan how did you escap

dartagnan bow to mme bonacieux dart at her the most love
glanc that he could possibl concentr upon her charm littl
person and while he descend the stair he heard the door close and
doublelock in two bound he wa at the louvr as he enter the
wicket of lechel ten oclock struck all the event we have
describ had taken place within a half hour
everyth fell out as mme bonacieux prophesi on hear the
password germain bow in a few minut laport wa at the lodg in
two word dartagnan inform him where mme bonacieux wa laport
assur himself by have it twice repeat of the accur address
and set off at a run hardli howev had he taken ten step befor he
return
young man said he to dartagnan a suggest
what
you mai get into troubl by what ha taken place
you believ so
ye have you ani friend whose clock is too slow
well
go and call upon him in order that he mai give evid of your
have been with him at half past nine in a court of justic that is
call an alibi
dartagnan found hi advic prudent he took to hi heel and wa soon
at m de trvill but instead of go into the saloon with the rest
of the crowd he ask to be introduc to m de trvill offic as
dartagnan so constantli frequent the htel no difficulti wa made
in compli with hi request and a servant went to inform m de
trvill that hi young compatriot have someth import to
commun solicit a privat audienc five minut after m de
trvill wa ask dartagnan what he could do to serv him and what
caus hi visit at so late an hour
pardon me monsieur said dartagnan who had profit by the moment
he had been left alon to put back m de trvill clock
threequart of an hour but i thought as it wa yet onli
twentyf minut past nine it wa not too late to wait upon you
twentyf minut past nine cri m de trvill look at the
clock why that imposs
look rather monsieur said dartagnan the clock show it
that true said m de trvill i believ it later but what can
i do for you
then dartagnan told m de trvill a long histori about the queen he
express to him the fear he entertain with respect to her majesti
he relat to him what he had heard of the project of the cardin
with regard to buckingham and all with a tranquil and candor of
which m de trvill wa the more the dupe from have himself as we
have said observ someth fresh between the cardin the king and
the queen
as ten oclock wa strike dartagnan left m de trvill who
thank him for hi inform recommend him to have the servic of
the king and queen alwai at heart and return to the saloon but at
the foot of the stair dartagnan rememb he had forgotten hi
cane he consequ sprang up again reenter the offic with a
turn of hi finger set the clock right again that it might not be
perceiv the next dai that it had been put wrong and certain from
that time that he had a wit to prove hi alibi he ran downstair
and soon found himself in the street
chapter xi
in which the plot thicken
hi visit to m de trvill be paid the pensiv dartagnan took the
longest wai homeward
on what wa dartagnan think that he strai thu from hi path
gaze at the star of heaven and sometim sigh sometim
smile
he wa think of mme bonacieux for an apprentic musket the
young woman wa almost an ideal of love pretti mysteri initi
in almost all the secret of the court which reflect such a charm
graviti over her pleas featur it might be surmis that she wa
not wholli unmov and thi is an irresist charm to novic in
love moreov dartagnan had deliv her from the hand of the
demon who wish to search and ill treat her and thi import
servic had establish between them on of those sentiment of
gratitud which so easili assum a more tender charact
dartagnan alreadi fanci himself so rapid is the flight of our
dream upon the wing of imagin accost by a messeng from the
young woman who brought him some billet appoint a meet a gold
chain or a diamond we have observ that young cavali receiv
present from their king without shame let us add that in these time
of lax moral thei had no more delicaci with respect to the
mistress and that the latter almost alwai left them valuabl and
durabl remembr as if thei essai to conquer the fragil of
their sentiment by the solid of their gift
without a blush men made their wai in the world by the mean of women
blush such as were onli beauti gave their beauti whenc
without doubt come the proverb the most beauti girl in the world
can onli give what she ha such as were rich gave in addit a part
of their monei and a vast number of hero of that gallant period mai
be cite who would neither have won their spur in the first place nor
their battl afterward without the purs more or less furnish
which their mistress fasten to the saddl bow
dartagnan own noth provinci diffid that slight varnish
the ephemer flower that down of the peach had evapor to the
wind through the littl orthodox counsel which the three musket
gave their friend dartagnan follow the strang custom of the
time consid himself at pari as on a campaign neither more nor
less than if he had been in flandersspain yonder woman here in each
there wa an enemi to contend with and contribut to be levi
but we must sai at the present moment dartagnan wa rule by a
feel much more nobl and disinterest the mercer had said that he
wa rich the young man might easili guess that with so weak a man as
m bonacieux and interest wa almost foreign to thi commenc of
love which had been the consequ of it we sai almost for the
idea that a young handsom kind and witti woman is at the same time
rich take noth from the begin of love but on the contrari
strengthen it
there ar in affluenc a crowd of aristocrat care and capric which
ar highli becom to beauti a fine and white stock a silken
robe a lace kerchief a pretti slipper on the foot a tasti ribbon on
the head do not make an ugli woman pretti but thei make a pretti woman
beauti without reckon the hand which gain by all thi the
hand among women particularli to be beauti must be idl
then dartagnan as the reader from whom we have not conceal the
state of hi fortun veri well knowsdartagnan wa not a millionair
he hope to becom on somedai but the time which in hi own mind he
fix upon for thi happi chang wa still far distant in the
meanwhil how dishearten to see the woman on love long for those
thousand of noth which constitut a woman happi and be
unabl to give her those thousand of noth at least when the
woman is rich and the lover is not that which he cannot offer she
offer to herself and although it is gener with her husband
monei that she procur herself thi indulg the gratitud for it
seldom revert to him
then dartagnan dispos to becom the most tender of lover wa at
the same time a veri devot friend in the midst of hi amor
project for the mercer wife he did not forget hi friend the
pretti mme bonacieux wa just the woman to walk with in the plain st
deni or in the fair of st germain in compani with atho portho
and arami to whom dartagnan had often remark thi then on could
enjoi charm littl dinner where on touch on on side the hand
of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress besid on
press occas in extrem difficulti dartagnan would becom
the preserv of hi friend
and m bonacieux whom dartagnan had push into the hand of the
offic deni him aloud although he had promis in a whisper to
save him we ar compel to admit to our reader that dartagnan
thought noth about him in ani wai or that if he did think of him
it wa onli to sai to himself that he wa veri well where he wa
wherev it might be love is the most selfish of all the passion
let our reader reassur themselv if dartagnan forget hi host or
appear to forget him under the pretens of not know where he ha
been carri we will not forget him and we know where he is but for
the moment let us do as did the amor gascon we will see after the
worthi mercer later
dartagnan reflect on hi futur amour address himself to the
beauti night and smile at the star ascend the rue
cherishmidi or chasemidi as it wa then call as he found himself
in the quarter in which arami live he took it into hi head to pai
hi friend a visit in order to explain the motiv which had led him to
send planchet with a request that he would come instantli to the
mousetrap now if arami had been at home when planchet came to hi
abod he had doubtless hasten to the rue de fossoyeur and find
nobodi there but hi other two companion perhap thei would not be
abl to conceiv what all thi meant thi mysteri requir an
explan at least so dartagnan declar to himself
he likewis thought thi wa an opportun for talk about pretti
littl mme bonacieux of whom hi head if not hi heart wa alreadi
full we must never look for discret in first love first love is
accompani by such excess joi that unless the joi be allow to
overflow it will stifl you
pari for two hour past had been dark and seem a desert eleven
oclock sound from all the clock of the faubourg st germain it wa
delight weather dartagnan wa pass along a lane on the spot
where the rue dassa is now situat breath the balmi eman
which were born upon the wind from the rue de vaugirard and which
aros from the garden refresh by the dew of even and the breez
of night from a distanc resound deaden howev by good
shutter the song of the tippler enjoi themselv in the
cabaret scatter along the plain arriv at the end of the lane
dartagnan turn to the left the hous in which arami dwelt wa
situat between the rue cassett and the rue servandoni
dartagnan had just pass the rue cassett and alreadi perceiv the
door of hi friend hous shade by a mass of sycamor and clemati
which form a vast arch opposit the front of it when he perceiv
someth like a shadow issu from the rue servandoni thi someth
wa envelop in a cloak and dartagnan at first believ it wa a
man but by the small of the form the hesit of the walk and
the indecis of the step he soon discov that it wa a woman
further thi woman as if not certain of the hous she wa seek
lift up her ey to look around her stop went backward and then
return again dartagnan wa perplex
shall i go and offer her my servic thought he by her step she
must be young perhap she is pretti oh ye but a woman who wander
in the street at thi hour onli ventur out to meet her lover if i
should disturb a rendezv that would not be the best mean of
commenc an acquaint
meantim the young woman continu to advanc count the hous and
window thi wa neither long nor difficult there were but three
htel in thi part of the street and onli two window look toward
the road on of which wa in a pavilion parallel to that which arami
occupi the other belong to arami himself
pardieu said dartagnan to himself to whose mind the niec of the
theologian revert pardieu it would be droll if thi belat dove
should be in search of our friend hous but on my soul it look so
ah my dear arami thi time i shall find you out and dartagnan
make himself as small as he could conceal himself in the darkest
side of the street near a stone bench place at the back of a nich
the young woman continu to advanc and in addit to the light
of her step which had betrai her she emit a littl cough which
denot a sweet voic dartagnan believ thi cough to be a signal
nevertheless whether the cough had been answer by a similar signal
which had fix the irresolut of the nocturn seeker or whether
without thi aid she saw that she had arriv at the end of her
journei she resolut drew near to aramiss shutter and tap at
three equal interv with her bent finger
thi is all veri fine dear arami murmur dartagnan ah
monsieur hypocrit i understand how you studi theologi
the three blow were scarc struck when the insid blind wa open
and a light appear through the pane of the outsid shutter
ah ah said the listen not through door but through window
ah thi visit wa expect we shall see the window open and the
ladi enter by escalad veri pretti
but to the great astonish of dartagnan the shutter remain
close still more the light which had shone for an instant
disappear and all wa again in obscur
dartagnan thought thi could not last long and continu to look with
all hi ey and listen with all hi ear
he wa right at the end of some second two sharp tap were heard
insid the young woman in the street repli by a singl tap and the
shutter wa open a littl wai
it mai be judg whether dartagnan look or listen with avid
unfortun the light had been remov into anoth chamber but the
ey of the young man were accustom to the night besid the ey
of the gascon have as it is assert like those of cat the faculti
of see in the dark
dartagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white
object which she unfold quickli and which took the form of a
handkerchief she made her interlocutor observ the corner of thi
unfold object
thi immedi recal to dartagnan mind the handkerchief which
he had found at the feet of mme bonacieux which had remind him of
that which he had drag from under the feet of arami
what the devil could that handkerchief signifi
place where he wa dartagnan could not perceiv the face of arami
we sai arami becaus the young man entertain no doubt that it wa
hi friend who held thi dialogu from the interior with the ladi of
the exterior curios prevail over prudenc and profit by the
preoccup into which the sight of the handkerchief appear to have
plung the two personag now on the scene he stole from hi hide
place and quick as lightn but step with utmost caution he ran
and place himself close to the angl of the wall from which hi ey
could pierc the interior of aramiss room
upon gain thi advantag dartagnan wa near utter a cry of
surpris it wa not arami who wa convers with the nocturn
visitor it wa a woman dartagnan howev could onli see enough to
recogn the form of her vestment not enough to distinguish her
featur
at the same instant the woman insid drew a second handkerchief from
her pocket and exchang it for that which had just been shown to her
then some word were spoken by the two women at length the shutter

him enter thi carriag the offic place himself by hi side the
door wa lock and thei were left in a roll prison the carriag
wa put in motion as slowli as a funer car through the close
fasten window the prison could perceiv the hous and the

recogn everi street by the mileston the sign and the lamp at
the moment of arriv at st paulth spot where such as were
condemn at the bastil were executedh wa near faint and
cross himself twice he thought the carriag wa about to stop there

farther on a still greater terror seiz him on pass by the
cemeteri of st jean where state crimin were buri on thing
howev reassur him he rememb that befor thei were buri
their head were gener cut off and he felt that hi head wa still
on hi shoulder but when he saw the carriag take the wai to la
grve when he perceiv the point roof of the htel de vill and
the carriag pass under the arcad he believ it wa over with him
he wish to confess to the offic and upon hi refus utter such
pitiabl cri that the offic told him that if he continu to deafen
him thu he should put a gag in hi mouth
thi measur somewhat reassur bonacieux if thei meant to execut him
at la grve it could scarc be worth while to gag him as thei had
nearli reach the place of execut inde the carriag cross the
fatal spot without stop there remain then no other place to
fear but the traitor cross the carriag wa take the direct road
to it
thi time there wa no longer ani doubt it wa at the traitor cross
that lesser crimin were execut bonacieux had flatter himself in
believ himself worthi of st paul or of the place de grve it wa
at the traitor cross that hi journei and hi destini were about to
end he could not yet see that dread cross but he felt somehow as
if it were come to meet him when he wa within twenti pace of it
he heard a nois of peopl and the carriag stop thi wa more than
poor bonacieux could endur depress as he wa by the success
emot which he had experienc he utter a feebl groan which
might have been taken for the last sigh of a dy man and faint

it is well known how violent the king prejudic were against the
queen and how carefulli these prejudic were kept up by the cardin
who in affair of intrigu mistrust women infinit more than men
on of the grand caus of thi prejudic wa the friendship of ann of
austria for mme de chevreus these two women gave him more uneasi
than the war with spain the quarrel with england or the embarrass
of the financ in hi ey and to hi convict mme de chevreus
not onli serv the queen in her polit intrigu but what
torment him still more in her amor intrigu
at the first word the cardin spoke of mme de chevreusewho though

cours of justic violent by fall sword in hand upon the honest
men of the law charg with investig imparti the whole affair
in order to place it befor the ey of the kingloui xiii could not
contain himself and he made a step toward the queen apart with
that pale and mute indign which when it broke out led thi

buckingham
at thi instant m de trvill enter cool polit and in

affirm sire if i can believ what he sai that there doe not exist
a more devot servant of your majesti or a more profound admir of

their busi to judg and thei shall judg
onli repli trvill it is a sad thing that in the unfortun
time in which we live the purest life the most incontest virtu
cannot exempt a man from infami and persecut the armi i will
answer for it will be but littl pleas at be expos to rigor
treatment on account of polic affair
the express wa imprud but m de trvill launch it with
knowledg of hi caus he wa desir of an explos becaus in
that case the mine throw forth fire and fire enlighten
polic affair cri the king take up trvill word polic

your account that if by mischanc a musket is arrest franc is
in danger what a nois about a musket i would arrest ten of them
ventrebleu a hundr even all the compani and i would not allow a

trvill sai besid ad he lower hi voic and look with
a suppliant air at the cardin let us give them appar secur
that is polici
thi polici of loui xiii made richelieu smile
order it as you pleas sire you possess the right of pardon
the right of pardon onli appli to the guilti said trvill who
wa determin to have the last word and my musket is innoc it

fear he would have prefer an obstin resist on the part of
the cardin to thi sudden yield
the king sign the order for releas and trvill carri it awai
without delai as he wa about to leav the presenc the cardin gave
him a friendli smile and said a perfect harmoni reign sire
between the leader and the soldier of your musket which must be
profit for the servic and honor to all
he will plai me some dog trick or other and that immedi said
trvill on ha never the last word with such a man but let us be
quickth king mai chang hi mind in an hour and at all event it is
more difficult to replac a man in the fort levqu or the bastil
who ha got out than to keep a prison there who is in
m de trvill made hi entranc triumphantli into the fort levqu
whenc he deliv the musket whose peac indiffer had not
for a moment abandon him
the first time he saw dartagnan you have come off well said he to
him there is your jussac thrust paid for there still remain that of
bernajoux but you must not be too confid
as to the rest m de trvill had good reason to mistrust the cardin
and to think that all wa not over for scarc had the captain of the
musket close the door after him than hi emin said to the
king now that we ar at length by ourselv we will if your majesti
pleas convers serious sire buckingham ha been in pari five
dai and onli left thi morn
chapter xvi
in which m sguier keeper of the seal look more than onc for the
bell
it is imposs to form an idea of the impress these few word made
upon loui xiii he grew pale and red altern and the cardin saw
at onc that he had recov by a singl blow all the ground he had
lost
buckingham in pari cri he and why doe he come
to conspir no doubt with your enemi the huguenot and the
spaniard
no pardieu no to conspir against my honor with madam de
chevreus madam de longuevil and the cond
oh sire what an idea the queen is too virtuou and besid love
your majesti too well
woman is weak monsieur cardin said the king and as to love me
much i have my own opinion as to that love
i not the less maintain said the cardin that the duke of
buckingham came to pari for a project wholli polit
and i am sure that he came for quit anoth purpos monsieur
cardin but if the queen be guilti let her trembl
inde said the cardin whatev repugn i mai have to
direct my mind to such a treason your majesti compel me to think
of it madam de lannoi whom accord to your majesti command i
have frequent interrog told me thi morn that the night
befor last her majesti sat up veri late that thi morn she wept
much and that she wa write all dai
that it cri the king to him no doubt cardin i must have
the queen paper
but how to take them sire it seem to me that it is neither your
majesti nor myself who can charg himself with such a mission
how did thei act with regard to the marchal dancr cri the
king in the highest state of choler first her closet were
thoroughli search and then she herself
the marchal dancr wa no more than the marchal dancr a
florentin adventur sire and that wa all while the august spous
of your majesti is ann of austria queen of francethat is to sai on
of the greatest princess in the world
she is not the less guilti monsieur duke the more she ha forgotten

fall besid i long ago determin to put an end to all these petti
intrigu of polici and love she ha near her a certain laport
who i believ is the mainspr of all thi i confess said the
cardin

i believ and i repeat it to your majesti that the queen conspir
against the power of the king but i have not said against hi honor
and ii tell you against both i tell you the queen doe not love me
i tell you she love anoth i tell you she love that infam
buckingham why did you not have him arrest while in pari
arrest the duke arrest the prime minist of king charl i think
of it sire what a scandal and if the suspicion of your majesti
which i still continu to doubt should prove to have ani foundat
what a terribl disclosur what a fear scandal
but as he expos himself like a vagabond or a thief he should have
been
loui xiii stop terrifi at what he wa about to sai while
richelieu stretch out hi neck wait uselessli for the word which
had di on the lip of the king
he should have been

you of cours did not lose sight of him
no sire
where did he lodg

where is that
by the side of the luxembourg

the chancellor enter half smile half blush as we shall
probabl meet with him again in the cours of our histori it mai be
well for our reader to be made at onc acquaint with him
thi chancellor wa a pleasant man he wa de roch le masl canon
of notr dame who had formerli been valet of a bishop who introduc
him to hi emin as a perfectli devout man the cardin trust

for some time the folli of adolesc on enter thi holi place
the poor penit wa unabl to shut the door so close as to prevent
the passion he fled from enter with him he wa incessantli
attack by them and the superior to whom he had confid thi
misfortun wish as much as in him lai to free him from them had
advis him in order to conjur awai the tempt demon to have
recours to the bell rope and ring with all hi might at the
denunci sound the monk would be render awar that temptat
wa besieg a brother and all the commun would go to prayer
thi advic appear good to the futur chancellor he conjur the
evil spirit with abund of prayer offer up by the monk but the
devil doe not suffer himself to be easili dispossess from a place in
which he ha fix hi garrison in proport as thei redoubl the

which the penit experienc
the monk had no longer an instant of repos by dai thei did noth
but ascend and descend the step which led to the chapel at night in
addit to complin and matin thei were further oblig to leap
twenti time out of their bed and prostrat themselv on the floor of

the queen would place the import letter she had written that dai
when the chancellor had open and shut twenti time the drawer of the

experienceit becam necessari i sai to come to the conclus of the
affair that is to sai to search the queen herself the chancellor
advanc therefor toward ann of austria and said with a veri
perplex and embarrass air and now it remain for me to make the
princip examin
what is that ask the queen who did not understand or rather wa
not will to understand

the chancellor made a profound rever then with the intent
quit patent of not draw back a foot from the accomplish of the
commiss with which he wa charg and as the attend of an
execution might have done in the chamber of tortur he approach
ann of austria from whose ey at the same instant sprang tear of
rage
the queen wa as we have said of great beauti the commiss might

convers with ann of austria to obtain some inform from that
convers and afterward to come upon hi emin with some secret
which the cardin either knew or did not know but which in either
case would rais him infinit in the ey of hi minist
he went then to the queen and accord to custom accost her with
fresh menac against those who surround her ann of austria lower
her head allow the torrent to flow on without repli hope that
it would ceas of itself but thi wa not what loui xiii meant loui

chang that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinala
chang which had sinc been strengthen by two or three visit from
the comt de rochefort who had becom the best friend of bonacieux
and had persuad him without much troubl that no culpabl
sentiment had prompt the abduct of hi wife but that it wa onli
a polit precaut
she found m bonacieux alon the poor man wa recov with
difficulti the order in hi hous in which he had found most of the
furnitur broken and the closet nearli emptiedjustic not be on
of the three thing which king solomon name as leav no trace of

hi wife of hi happi return and hi wife had repli by
congratul him and tell him that the first moment she could
steal from her duti should be devot to pai him a visit
thi first moment had been delai five dai which under ani other
circumst might have appear rather long to m bonacieux but he
had in the visit he had made to the cardin and in the visit
rochefort had made him ampl subject for reflect and as everybodi

thi wa the more so becaus bonacieux reflect were all
rosecolor rochefort call him hi friend hi dear bonacieux and
never ceas tell him that the cardin had a great respect for him
the mercer fanci himself alreadi on the high road to honor and
fortun
on her side mme bonacieux had also reflect but it must be
admit upon someth wide differ from ambit in spite of
herself her thought constantli revert to that handsom young man who
wa so brave and appear to be so much in love marri at eighteen to
m bonacieux have alwai live among her husband friendspeopl
littl capabl of inspir ani sentiment whatev in a young woman
whose heart wa abov her positionmm bonacieux had remain
insens to vulgar seduct but at thi period the titl of
gentleman had great influenc with the citizen class and dartagnan
wa a gentleman besid he wore the uniform of the guard which
next to that of the musket wa most admir by the ladi he wa
we repeat handsom young and bold he spoke of love like a man who
did love and wa anxiou to be love in return there wa certainli

bonacieux wa repeat word for word a sentenc which he had heard
from the comt de rochefort but the poor wife who had reckon on her
husband and who in that hope had answer for him to the queen did
not trembl the less both at the danger into which she had nearli cast

to london gentlemen said dartagnan
to london cri portho and what the devil ar we go to do in
london
that is what i am not at liberti to tell you gentlemen you must
trust to me
but in order to go to london ad portho monei is need and i
have none
nor i said arami
nor i said atho
i have repli dartagnan pull out hi treasur from hi pocket
and place it on the tabl there ar in thi bag three hundr
pistol let each take seventyf that is enough to take us to
london and back besid make yourselv easi we shall not all arriv
at london
why so
becaus in all probabl some on of us will be left on the road
is thi then a campaign upon which we ar now enter
on of a most danger kind i give you notic
ah but if we do risk be kill said portho at least i should
like to know what for
you would be all the wiser said atho
and yet said arami i am somewhat of porthoss opinion
is the king accustom to give you such reason no he sai to you
jauntili gentlemen there is fight go on in gasconi or in
flander go and fight and you go there why you need give
yourselv no more uneasi about thi
dartagnan is right said atho here ar our three leav of
absenc which came from monsieur de trvill and here ar three
hundr pistol which came from i dont know where so let us go and
get kill where we ar told to go is life worth the troubl of so
mani question dartagnan i am readi to follow you
and i also said portho
and i also said arami and inde i am not sorri to quit pari
i had need of distract
well you will have distract enough gentlemen be assur said
dartagnan
and now when ar we to go ask atho
immedi repli dartagnan we have not a minut to lose
hello grimaud planchet mousqueton bazin cri the four young
men call their lackei clean my boot and fetch the hors from
the htel
each musket wa accustom to leav at the gener htel as at a
barrack hi own hors and that of hi lackei planchet grimaud
mousqueton and bazin set off at full speed
now let us lai down the plan of campaign said portho where do we
go first
to calai said dartagnan that is the most direct line to london
well said portho thi is my advic
speak
four men travel togeth would be suspect dartagnan will give
each of us hi instruct i will go by the wai of boulogn to clear
the wai atho will set out two hour after by that of amien arami
will follow us by that of noyon as to dartagnan he will go by what
rout he think is best in planchet cloth while planchet will
follow us like dartagnan in the uniform of the guard
gentlemen said atho my opinion is that it is not proper to allow
lackei to have anyth to do in such an affair a secret mai by
chanc be betrai by gentlemen but it is almost alwai sold by
lackei
porthoss plan appear to me to be impractic said dartagnan
inasmuch as i am myself ignor of what instruct i can give you
i am the bearer of a letter that is all i have not and i cannot make
three copi of that letter becaus it is seal we must then as it
appear to me travel in compani thi letter is here in thi pocket
and he point to the pocket which contain the letter if i should
be kill on of you must take it and continu the rout if he be
kill it will be anoth turn and so onprovid a singl on
arriv that is all that is requir
bravo dartagnan your opinion is mine cri atho besid we
must be consist i am go to take the water you will accompani
me instead of take the water of forg i go and take sea water i
am free to do so if anyon wish to stop us i will show monsieur de
trvill letter and you will show your leav of absenc if we ar
attack we will defend ourselv if we ar tri we will stoutli
maintain that we were onli anxiou to dip ourselv a certain number of
time in the sea thei would have an easi bargain of four isol men
wherea four men togeth make a troop we will arm our four lackei
with pistol and musketoon if thei send an armi out against us we
will give battl and the survivor as dartagnan sai will carri the
letter
well said cri arami you dont often speak atho but when you
do speak it is like st john of the golden mouth i agre to athoss
plan and you portho
i agre to it too said portho if dartagnan approv of it
dartagnan be the bearer of the letter is natur the head of
the enterpris let him decid and we will execut
well said dartagnan i decid that we should adopt athoss plan
and that we set off in half an hour
agre shout the three musket in choru
each on stretch out hi hand to the bag took hi seventyf
pistol and made hi prepar to set out at the time appoint
chapter xx
the journei
at two oclock in the morn our four adventur left pari by the
barrir st deni as long as it wa dark thei remain silent in
spite of themselv thei submit to the influenc of the obscur
and apprehend ambush on everi side
with the first rai of dai their tongu were loosen with the sun
gaieti reviv it wa like the ev of a battl the heart beat the
ey laugh and thei felt that the life thei were perhap go to
lose wa after all a good thing
besid the appear of the caravan wa formid the black hors
of the musket their martial carriag with the regiment step of
these nobl companion of the soldier would have betrai the most
strict incognito the lackei follow arm to the teeth
all went well till thei arriv at chantilli which thei reach about
eight oclock in the morn thei need breakfast and alight at
the door of an auberg recommend by a sign repres st martin
give half hi cloak to a poor man thei order the lackei not to
unsaddl the hors and to hold themselv in readi to set off
again immedi
thei enter the common hall and place themselv at tabl a
gentleman who had just arriv by the rout of dammartin wa seat
at the same tabl and wa breakfast he open the convers
about rain and fine weather the travel repli he drank to their
good health and the travel return hi polit
but at the moment mousqueton came to announc that the hors were
readi and thei were aris from tabl the stranger propos to
portho to drink the health of the cardin portho repli that he
ask no better if the stranger in hi turn would drink the health of
the king the stranger cri that he acknowledg no other king but hi
emin portho call him drunk and the stranger drew hi sword
you have commit a piec of folli said atho but it cant be
help there is no draw back kill the fellow and rejoin us as
soon as you can
all three remount their hors and set out at a good pace while
portho wa promis hi adversari to perfor him with all the
thrust known in the fenc school
there goe on cri atho at the end of five hundr pace
but why did that man attack portho rather than ani other on of us
ask arami
becaus as portho wa talk louder than the rest of us he took
him for the chief said dartagnan
i alwai said that thi cadet from gasconi wa a well of wisdom
murmur atho and the travel continu their rout
at beauvai thei stop two hour as well to breath their hors a
littl as to wait for portho at the end of two hour as portho did
not come not ani new of him thei resum their journei
at a leagu from beauvai where the road wa confin between two high
bank thei fell in with eight or ten men who take advantag of the
road be unpav in thi spot appear to be emploi in dig
hole and fill up the rut with mud
arami not like to soil hi boot with thi artifici mortar
apostroph them rather sharpli atho wish to restrain him but it
wa too late the labor began to jeer the travel and by their
insol disturb the equanim even of the cool atho who urg on
hi hors against on of them
then each of these men retreat as far as the ditch from which each
took a conceal musket the result wa that our seven travel were
outnumb in weapon arami receiv a ball which pass through hi
shoulder and mousqueton anoth ball which lodg in the fleshi part
which prolong the lower portion of the loin therefor mousqueton
alon fell from hi hors not becaus he wa sever wound but not
be abl to see the wound he judg it to be more seriou than it
realli wa
it wa an ambuscad shout dartagnan dont wast a charg
forward
arami wound as he wa seiz the mane of hi hors which carri
him on with the other mousqueton hors rejoin them and gallop
by the side of hi companion
that will serv us for a relai said atho
i would rather have had a hat said dartagnan mine wa carri
awai by a ball by my faith it is veri fortun that the letter wa
not in it
theyll kill poor portho when he come up said arami
if portho were on hi leg he would have rejoin us by thi time
said atho my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man wa not
intox
thei continu at their best speed for two hour although the hors
were so fatigu that it wa to be fear thei would soon refus
servic
the travel had chosen crossroad in the hope that thei might meet
with less interrupt but at crvecur arami declar he could
proce no farther in fact it requir all the courag which he
conceal beneath hi eleg form and polish manner to bear him so
far he grew more pale everi minut and thei were oblig to support
him on hi hors thei lift him off at the door of a cabaret left
bazin with him who besid in a skirmish wa more embarrass than
us and set forward again in the hope of sleep at amien
morbleu said atho as soon as thei were again in motion reduc
to two master and grimaud and planchet morbleu i wont be their
dupe i will answer for it i will neither open my mouth nor draw my
sword between thi and calai i swear by
dont wast time in swear said dartagnan let us gallop if our
hors will consent
and the travel buri their rowel in their hors flank who thu
vigor stimul recov their energi thei arriv at amien
at midnight and alight at the auberg of the golden lili
the host had the appear of as honest a man as ani on earth he
receiv the travel with hi candlestick in on hand and hi cotton
nightcap in the other he wish to lodg the two travel each in a
charm chamber but unfortun these charm chamber were at the
opposit extrem of the htel dartagnan and atho refus them
the host repli that he had no other worthi of their excel but
the travel declar thei would sleep in the common chamber each on
a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground the host insist
but the travel were firm and he wa oblig to do as thei wish
thei had just prepar their bed and barricad their door within
when someon knock at the yard shutter thei demand who wa there
and recogn the voic of their lackei open the shutter it wa
inde planchet and grimaud
grimaud can take care of the hors said planchet if you ar
will gentlemen i will sleep across your doorwai and you will then
be certain that nobodi can reach you
and on what will you sleep said dartagnan
here is my bed repli planchet produc a bundl of straw

everyth believ me the cardin is not the man to forget a
mystif until he ha settl account with the mystifi and the

follow the road much more beauti then than it is now which lead
to st cloud
as long as he wa in the citi planchet kept at the respect distanc
he had impos upon himself but as soon as the road began to be more
lone and dark he drew softli nearer so that when thei enter the
boi de boulogn he found himself ride quit natur side by side
with hi master in fact we must not dissembl that the oscil of
the tall tree and the reflect of the moon in the dark underwood
gave him seriou uneasi dartagnan could not help perceiv that
someth more than usual wa pass in the mind of hi lackei and
said well monsieur planchet what is the matter with us now
dont you think monsieur that wood ar like church
how so planchet
becaus we dare not speak aloud in on or the other

convers my dear planchet and no on could find fault with it

virtu
and you ar veri virtuou ar you not planchet

had we not better lower our head
in truth murmur dartagnan to whom m de trvill

and he put hi hors into a trot
planchet follow the movement of hi master as if he had been hi
shadow and wa soon trot by hi side
ar we go to continu thi pace all night ask planchet
no you ar at your journei end
how monsieur and you

that you see yonder and be in wait for me at the door by six
oclock in the morn
monsieur i have eaten and drunk respectfulli the crown you gave me
thi morn so that i have not a sou left in case i should be cold
here half a pistol tomorrow morn
dartagnan sprang from hi hors threw the bridl to planchet and
depart at a quick pace fold hi cloak around him
good lord how cold i am cri planchet as soon as he had lost
sight of hi master and in such hast wa he to warm himself that he
went straight to a hous set out with all the attribut of a suburban
tavern and knock at the door
in the meantim dartagnan who had plung into a bypath continu
hi rout and reach st cloud but instead of follow the main
street he turn behind the chteau reach a sort of retir lane
and found himself soon in front of the pavilion name it wa situat
in a veri privat spot a high wall at the angl of which wa the
pavilion ran along on side of thi lane and on the other wa a
littl garden connect with a poor cottag which wa protect by a
hedg from passersbi
he gain the place appoint and as no signal had been given him by
which to announc hi presenc he wait
not the least nois wa to be heard it might be imagin that he wa a
hundr mile from the capit dartagnan lean against the hedg
after have cast a glanc behind it beyond that hedg that garden
and that cottag a dark mist envelop with it fold that immens
where pari slepta vast void from which glitter a few lumin
point the funer star of that hell
but for dartagnan all aspect were cloth happili all idea wore a
smile all shade were diaphan the appoint hour wa about to
strike in fact at the end of a few minut the belfri of st cloud
let fall slowli ten stroke from it sonor jaw there wa someth
melancholi in thi brazen voic pour out it lament in the
middl of the night but each of those stroke which made up the
expect hour vibrat harmoni to the heart of the young man
hi ey were fix upon the littl pavilion situat at the angl of
the wall of which all the window were close with shutter except
on on the first stori through thi window shone a mild light which
silver the foliag of two or three linden tree which form a group
outsid the park there could be no doubt that behind thi littl
window which threw forth such friendli beam the pretti mme
bonacieux expect him
wrap in thi sweet idea dartagnan wait half an hour without the
least impati hi ey fix upon that charm littl abod of
which he could perceiv a part of the ceil with it gild mold
attest the eleg of the rest of the apart
the belfri of st cloud sound half past ten
thi time without know why dartagnan felt a cold shiver run
through hi vein perhap the cold began to affect him and he took a
perfectli physic sensat for a moral impress
then the idea seiz him that he had read incorrectli and that the
appoint wa for eleven oclock he drew near to the window and
place himself so that a rai of light should fall upon the letter as
he held it he drew it from hi pocket and read it again but he had
not been mistaken the appoint wa for ten oclock he went and
resum hi post begin to be rather uneasi at thi silenc and
thi solitud
eleven oclock sound
dartagnan began now realli to fear that someth had happen to mme
bonacieux he clap hi hand three timesth ordinari signal of
lover but nobodi repli to him not even an echo
he then thought with a touch of vexat that perhap the young woman
had fallen asleep while wait for him he approach the wall and
tri to climb it but the wall had been recent point and
dartagnan could get no hold
at that moment he thought of the tree upon whose leav the light
still shone and as on of them droop over the road he thought that
from it branch he might get a glimps of the interior of the
pavilion
the tree wa easi to climb besid dartagnan wa but twenti year
old and consequ had not yet forgotten hi schoolboi habit in an
instant he wa among the branch and hi keen ey plung through
the transpar pane into the interior of the pavilion
it wa a strang thing and on which made dartagnan trembl from the
sole of hi foot to the root of hi hair to find that thi soft
light thi calm lamp enlighten a scene of fear disord on of
the window wa broken the door of the chamber had been beaten in and
hung split in two on it hing a tabl which had been cover with
an eleg supper wa overturn the decant broken in piec and
the fruit crush strew the floor everyth in the apart gave
evid of a violent and desper struggl dartagnan even fanci
he could recogn amid thi strang disord fragment of garment
and some bloodi spot stain the cloth and the curtain he hasten
to descend into the street with a fright beat at hi heart he
wish to see if he could find other trace of violenc
the littl soft light shone on in the calm of the night dartagnan
then perceiv a thing that he had not befor remarkedfor noth had
led him to the examinationthat the ground trampl here and
hoofmark there present confus trace of men and hors besid
the wheel of a carriag which appear to have come from pari had
made a deep impress in the soft earth which did not extend beyond
the pavilion but turn again toward pari
at length dartagnan in pursu hi research found near the wall a
woman torn glove thi glove wherev it had not touch the muddi
ground wa of irreproach odor it wa on of those perfum glove
that lover like to snatch from a pretti hand
as dartagnan pursu hi investig a more abund and more ici
sweat roll in larg drop from hi forehead hi heart wa oppress
by a horribl anguish hi respir wa broken and short and yet he
said to reassur himself that thi pavilion perhap had noth in
common with mme bonacieux that the young woman had made an
appoint with him befor the pavilion and not in the pavilion that
she might have been detain in pari by her duti or perhap by the
jealousi of her husband
but all these reason were combat destroi overthrown by that
feel of intim pain which on certain occas take possess
of our be and cri to us so as to be understood unmistak that
some great misfortun is hang over us
then dartagnan becam almost wild he ran along the high road took
the path he had befor taken and reach the ferri interrog the
boatman
about seven oclock in the even the boatman had taken over a young
woman wrap in a black mantl who appear to be veri anxiou not
to be recogn but entir on account of her precaut the
boatman had paid more attent to her and discov that she wa
young and pretti
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretti women who came to
st cloud and who had reason for not be seen and yet dartagnan
did not for an instant doubt that it wa mme bonacieux whom the
boatman had notic
dartagnan took advantag of the lamp which burn in the cabin of the
ferryman to read the billet of mme bonacieux onc again and satisfi
himself that he had not been mistaken that the appoint wa at st
cloud and not elsewher befor the destress pavilion and not in
anoth street everyth conspir to prove to dartagnan that hi
presenti had not deceiv him and that a great misfortun had
happen
he again ran back to the chteau it appear to him that someth
might have happen at the pavilion in hi absenc and that fresh
inform await him the lane wa still desert and the same calm
soft light shone through the window
dartagnan then thought of that cottag silent and obscur which had
no doubt seen all and could tell it tale the gate of the enclosur
wa shut but he leap over the hedg and in spite of the bark of
a chainedup dog went up to the cabin
no on answer to hi first knock a silenc of death reign in
the cabin as in the pavilion but as the cabin wa hi last resourc
he knock again
it soon appear to him that he heard a slight nois withina timid
nois which seem to trembl lest it should be heard
then dartagnan ceas knock and prai with an accent so full of
anxieti and promis terror and cajoleri that hi voic wa of a
natur to reassur the most fear at length an old wormeaten
shutter wa open or rather push ajar but close again as soon as
the light from a miser lamp which burn in the corner had shone
upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommel of dartagnan
nevertheless rapid as the movement had been dartagnan had had time
to get a glimps of the head of an old man
in the name of heaven cri he listen to me i have been wait
for someon who ha not come i am dy with anxieti ha anyth
particular happen in the neighborhood speak
the window wa again open slowli and the same face appear onli it
wa now still more pale than befor
dartagnan relat hi stori simpli with the omiss of name he
told how he had a rendezv with a young woman befor that pavilion
and how not see her come he had climb the linden tree and by
the light of the lamp had seen the disord of the chamber
the old man listen attent make a sign onli that it wa all
so and then when dartagnan had end he shook hi head with an air
that announc noth good
what do you mean cri dartagnan in the name of heaven explain
yourself
oh monsieur said the old man ask me noth for if i dare tell
you what i have seen certainli no good would befal me
you have then seen someth repli dartagnan in that case in
the name of heaven continu he throw him a pistol tell me
what you have seen and i will pledg you the word of a gentleman that
not on of your word shall escap from my heart
the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the
young man that he made him a sign to listen and repeat in a low
voic it wa scarc nine oclock when i heard a nois in the
street and wa wonder what it could be when on come to my door
i found that somebodi wa endeavor to open it as i am veri poor and
am not afraid of be rob i went and open the gate and saw three
men at a few pace from it in the shadow wa a carriag with two
hors and some saddlehors these hors evid belong to the
three men who were dress as cavali ah my worthi gentlemen
cri i what do you want you must have a ladder said he who
appear to be the leader of the parti ye monsieur the on with
which i gather my fruit lend it to us and go into your hous again
there is a crown for the annoy we have caus you onli rememb
thisif you speak a word of what you mai see or what you mai hear for

threaten you you ar lost at these word he threw me a crown which
i pick up and he took the ladder after shut the gate behind
them i pretend to return to the hous but i immedi went out a
back door and steal along in the shade of the hedg i gain
yonder clump of elder from which i could hear and see everyth the
three men brought the carriag up quietli and took out of it a littl
man stout short elderli and commonli dress in cloth of a dark
color who ascend the ladder veri carefulli look suspici in
at the window of the pavilion came down as quietli as he had gone up
and whisper it is she immedi he who had spoken to me
approach the door of the pavilion open it with a kei he had in hi
hand close the door and disappear while at the same time the other
two men ascend the ladder the littl old man remain at the coach
door the coachman took care of hi hors the lackei held the
saddlehors all at onc great cri resound in the pavilion and a
woman came to the window and open it as if to throw herself out of
it but as soon as she perceiv the other two men she fell back and
thei went into the chamber then i saw no more but i heard the nois
of break furnitur the woman scream and cri for help but her
cri were soon stifl two of the men appear bear the woman in
their arm and carri her to the carriag into which the littl old
man got after her the leader close the window came out an instant
after by the door and satisfi himself that the woman wa in the
carriag hi two companion were alreadi on horseback he sprang into
hi saddl the lackei took hi place by the coachman the carriag
went off at a quick pace escort by the three horsemen and all wa
over from that moment i have neither seen nor heard anyth
dartagnan entir overcom by thi terribl stori remain
motionless and mute while all the demon of anger and jealousi were
howl in hi heart
but my good gentleman resum the old man upon whom thi mute
despair certainli produc a greater effect than cri and tear would
have done do not take on so thei did not kill her and that a
comfort
can you guess said dartagnan who wa the man who head thi
infern expedit
i dont know him
but as you spoke to him you must have seen him
oh it a descript you want
exactli so
a tall dark man with black mustach dark ey and the air of a
gentleman
that the man cri dartagnan again he forev he he is my
demon appar and the other
which
the short on
oh he wa not a gentleman ill answer for it besid he did not
wear a sword and the other treat him with small consider
some lackei murmur dartagnan poor woman poor woman what have
thei done with you
you have promis to be secret my good monsieur said the old man
and i renew my promis be easi i am a gentleman a gentleman ha but
hi word and i have given you mine
with a heavi heart dartagnan again bent hi wai toward the ferri
sometim he hope it could not be mme bonacieux and that he should
find her next dai at the louvr sometim he fear she had had an
intrigu with anoth who in a jealou fit had surpris her and
carri her off hi mind wa torn by doubt grief and despair
oh if i had my three friend here cri he i should have at
least some hope of find her but who know what ha becom of
them
it wa past midnight the next thing wa to find planchet dartagnan
went success into all the cabaret in which there wa a light but
could not find planchet in ani of them
at the sixth he began to reflect that the search wa rather dubiou
dartagnan had appoint six oclock in the morn for hi lackei and
wherev he might be he wa right
besid it came into the young man mind that by remain in the
environ of the spot on which thi sad event had pass he would
perhap have some light thrown upon the mysteri affair at the
sixth cabaret then as we said dartagnan stop ask for a bottl
of wine of the best qualiti and place himself in the darkest corner
of the room determin thu to wait till daylight but thi time again
hi hope were disappoint and although he listen with all hi
ear he heard noth amid the oath coars joke and abus which
pass between the labor servant and carter who compris the
honor societi of which he form a part which could put him upon
the least track of her who had been stolen from him he wa compel
then after have swallow the content of hi bottl to pass the
time as well as to evad suspicion to fall into the easiest posit
in hi corner and to sleep whether well or ill dartagnan be it
rememb wa onli twenti year old and at that ag sleep ha it
imprescript right which it imperi insist upon even with the
saddest heart
toward six oclock dartagnan awok with that uncomfort feel
which gener accompani the break of dai after a bad night he wa
not long in make hi toilet he examin himself to see if advantag
had been taken of hi sleep and have found hi diamond ring on hi
finger hi purs in hi pocket and hi pistol in hi belt he rose
paid for hi bottl and went out to try if he could have ani better
luck in hi search after hi lackei than he had had the night befor
the first thing he perceiv through the damp grai mist wa honest
planchet who with the two hors in hand await him at the door of
a littl blind cabaret befor which dartagnan had pass without even
a suspicion of it exist
chapter xxv
portho
instead of return directli home dartagnan alight at the door of
m de trvill and ran quickli up the stair thi time he had decid
to relat all that had pass m de trvill would doubtless give him
good advic as to the whole affair besid as m de trvill saw the
queen almost daili he might be abl to draw from her majesti some
intellig of the poor young woman whom thei were doubtless make
pai veri dearli for her devoted to her mistress
m de trvill listen to the young man account with a serious
which prove that he saw someth els in thi adventur besid a
love affair when dartagnan had finish he said hum all thi
savor of hi emin a leagu off
but what is to be done said dartagnan
noth absolut noth at present but quit pari as i told
you as soon as possibl i will see the queen i will relat to her
the detail of the disappear of thi poor woman of which she is no
doubt ignor these detail will guid her on her part and on your
return i shall perhap have some good new to tell you reli on me
dartagnan knew that although a gascon m de trvill wa not in the
habit of make promis and that when by chanc he did promis he
more than kept hi word he bow to him then full of gratitud for
the past and for the futur and the worthi captain who on hi side
felt a live interest in thi young man so brave and so resolut
press hi hand kindli wish him a pleasant journei
determin to put the advic of m de trvill in practic instantli
dartagnan direct hi cours toward the rue de fossoyeur in order
to superintend the pack of hi valis on approach the hous he
perceiv m bonacieux in morn costum stand at hi threshold
all that the prudent planchet had said to him the preced even
about the sinist charact of the old man recur to the mind of
dartagnan who look at him with more attent than he had done
befor in fact in addit to that yellow sickli pale which
indic the insinu of the bile in the blood and which might
besid be accident dartagnan remark someth perfidi
signific in the plai of the wrinkl featur of hi counten a
rogu doe not laugh in the same wai that an honest man doe a
hypocrit doe not shed the tear of a man of good faith all falsehood
is a mask and howev well made the mask mai be with a littl
attent we mai alwai succe in distinguish it from the true
face
it appear then to dartagnan that m bonacieux wore a mask and
likewis that that mask wa most disagre to look upon in
consequ of thi feel of repugn he wa about to pass without
speak to him but as he had done the dai befor m bonacieux
accost him
well young man said he we appear to pass rather gai night seven
oclock in the morn pest you seem to revers ordinari custom
and come home at the hour when other peopl ar go out
no on can reproach you for anyth of the kind monsieur bonacieux
said the young man you ar a model for regular peopl it is true
that when a man possess a young and pretti wife he ha no need to
seek happi elsewher happi come to meet him doe it not
monsieur bonacieux
bonacieux becam as pale as death and grin a ghastli smile
ah ah said bonacieux you ar a jocular companion but where the
devil were you gad last night my young master it doe not appear
to be veri clean in the crossroad
dartagnan glanc down at hi boot all cover with mud but that
same glanc fell upon the shoe and stock of the mercer and it
might have been said thei had been dip in the same mud heap both
were stain with splash of mud of the same appear
then a sudden idea cross the mind of dartagnan that littl stout
man short and elderli that sort of lackei dress in dark cloth
treat without ceremoni by the men wear sword who compos the
escort wa bonacieux himself the husband had presid at the
abduct of hi wife
a terribl inclin seiz dartagnan to grasp the mercer by the
throat and strangl him but as we have said he wa a veri prudent
youth and he restrain himself howev the revolut which
appear upon hi counten wa so visibl that bonacieux wa
terrifi at it and he endeavor to draw back a step or two but as
he wa stand befor the half of the door which wa shut the
obstacl compel him to keep hi place
ah but you ar joke my worthi man said dartagnan it appear
to me that if my boot need a spong your stock and shoe stand in
equal need of a brush mai you not have been philand a littl
also monsieur bonacieux oh the devil that unpardon in a man
of your ag and who besid ha such a pretti wife as your
oh lord no said bonacieux but yesterdai i went to st mand to
make some inquiri after a servant as i cannot possibl do without
on and the road were so bad that i brought back all thi mud which
i have not yet had time to remov
the place name by bonacieux as that which had been the object of hi
journei wa a fresh proof in support of the suspicion dartagnan had
conceiv bonacieux had name mand becaus mand wa in an exactli
opposit direct from st cloud thi probabl afford him hi
first consol if bonacieux knew where hi wife wa on might by
extrem mean forc the mercer to open hi teeth and let hi secret
escap the question then wa how to chang thi probabl into a
certainti
pardon my dear monsieur bonacieux if i dont stand upon ceremoni
said dartagnan but noth make on so thirsti as want of sleep i
am parch with thirst allow me to take a glass of water in your
apart you know that is never refus among neighbor
without wait for the permiss of hi host dartagnan went quickli
into the hous and cast a rapid glanc at the bed it had not been
us bonacieux had not been ab he had onli been back an hour or
two he had accompani hi wife to the place of her confin or
els at least to the first relai
thank monsieur bonacieux said dartagnan empti hi glass
that is all i want of you i will now go up into my apart i
will make planchet brush my boot and when he ha done i will if you
like send him to you to brush your shoe
he left the mercer quit astonish at hi singular farewel and
ask himself if he had not been a littl inconsider
at the top of the stair he found planchet in a great fright
ah monsieur cri planchet as soon as he perceiv hi master
here is more troubl i thought you would never come in
what the matter now planchet demand dartagnan
oh i give you a hundr i give you a thousand time to guess
monsieur the visit i receiv in your absenc
when
about half an hour ago while you were at monsieur de trvill
who ha been here come speak
monsieur de cavoi
monsieur de cavoi
in person
the captain of the cardin guard
himself

i have no doubt that he did monsieur for all hi wheedl manner
wa he so sweet then
inde he wa all honei monsieur
inde
he came he said on the part of hi emin who wish you well

it wa call the palaiscardin befor richelieu gave it to the
king

could see
well what did he sai then
that you must not fail to call upon him in the cours of the dai and
then he ad in a low voic tell your master that hi emin is
veri well dispos toward him and that hi fortun perhap depend
upon thi interview
the snare is rather maladroit for the cardin repli the young
man smile
oh i saw the snare and i answer you would be quit in despair on
your return
where ha he gone ask monsieur de cavoi
to troy in champagn i answer
and when did he set out
yesterdai even
planchet my friend interrupt dartagnan you ar realli a
preciou fellow
you will understand monsieur i thought there would be still time if
you wish to see monsieur de cavoi to contradict me by sai you were
not yet gone the falsehood would then lie at my door and as i am not
a gentleman i mai be allow to lie
be of good heart planchet you shall preserv your reput as a
veraci man in a quarter of an hour we set off
that the advic i wa about to give monsieur and where ar we
go mai i ask without be too curiou
pardieu in the opposit direct to that which you said i wa
gone besid ar you not as anxiou to learn new of grimaud
mousqueton and bazin as i am to know what ha becom of atho
portho and arami

dartagnan went out first as had been agre upon then in order that
he might have noth to reproach himself with he direct hi step
for the last time toward the resid of hi three friend no new

eleg write in small charact had come for arami dartagnan

him
he ha done us the honor to remain here
what he had done you the honor to remain here
ye monsieur in thi hous and we ar even a littl uneasi
on what account
of certain expens he ha contract
well but whatev expens he mai have incur i am sure he is in a
condit to pai them
ah monsieur you infus genuin balm into my blood we have made
consider advanc and thi veri morn the surgeon declar that
if monsieur portho did not pai him he should look to me as it wa i
who had sent for him
portho is wound then
i cannot tell you monsieur
what you cannot tell me sure you ought to be abl to tell me
better than ani other person
ye but in our situat we must not sai all we knowparticularli as
we have been warn that our ear should answer for our tongu
well can i see portho
certainli monsieur take the stair on your right go up the first
flight and knock at number on onli warn him that it is you
why should i do that
becaus monsieur some mischief might happen to you
of what kind in the name of wonder
monsieur portho mai imagin you belong to the hous and in a fit of
passion might run hi sword through you or blow out your brain
what have you done to him then
we have ask him for monei
the devil ah i can understand that it is a demand that portho
take veri ill when he is not in fund but i know he must be so at
present
we thought so too monsieur as our hous is carri on veri
regularli and we make out our bill everi week at the end of eight
dai we present our account but it appear we had chosen an unlucki
moment for at the first word on the subject he sent us to all the
devil it is true he had been plai the dai befor
plai the dai befor and with whom
lord who can sai monsieur with some gentleman who wa travel
thi wai to whom he propos a game of lansquenet
that it then and the foolish fellow lost all he had
even to hi hors monsieur for when the gentleman wa about to set
out we perceiv that hi lackei wa saddl monsieur porthoss
hors as well as hi master when we observ thi to him he told
us all to troubl ourselv about our own busi as thi hors
belong to him we also inform monsieur portho of what wa go
on but he told us we were scoundrel to doubt a gentleman word and
that as he had said the hors wa hi it must be so
that portho all over murmur dartagnan
then continu the host i repli that as from the moment we
seem not like to come to a good understand with respect to
payment i hope that he would have at least the kind to grant the
favor of hi custom to my brother host of the golden eagl but
monsieur portho repli that my hous be the best he should
remain where he wa thi repli wa too flatter to allow me to
insist on hi departur i confin myself then to beg him to give
up hi chamber which is the handsomest in the htel and to be
satisfi with a pretti littl room on the third floor but to thi
monsieur portho repli that as he everi moment expect hi mistress
who wa on of the greatest ladi in the court i might easili
comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupi in my hous
wa itself veri mean for the visit of such a personag nevertheless
while acknowledg the truth of what he said i thought proper to
insist but without even give himself the troubl to enter into ani
discuss with me he took on of hi pistol laid it on hi tabl
dai and night and said that at the first word that should be spoken to
him about remov either within the hous or out of it he would blow
out the brain of the person who should be so imprud as to meddl
with a matter which onli concern himself sinc that time monsieur
nobodi enter hi chamber but hi servant
what mousqueton is here then
oh ye monsieur five dai after your departur he came back and
in a veri bad condit too it appear that he had met with
disagre likewis on hi journei unfortun he is more
nimbl than hi master so that for the sake of hi master he put us
all under hi feet and as he think we might refus what he ask for
he take all he want without ask at all
the fact is said dartagnan i have alwai observ a great degre
of intellig and devoted in mousqueton
that is possibl monsieur but suppos i should happen to be brought
in contact even four time a year with such intellig and
devotednesswhi i should be a ruin man
no for portho will pai you
hum said the host in a doubt tone
the favorit of a great ladi will not be allow to be inconvenienc
for such a paltri sum as he ow you
if i durst sai what i believ on that head
what you believ
i ought rather to sai what i know
what you know
and even what i am sure of
and of what ar you so sure
i would sai that i know thi great ladi
you
ye i
and how do you know her
oh monsieur if i could believ i might trust in your discret
speak by the word of a gentleman you shall have no caus to repent
of your confid
well monsieur you understand that uneasi make us do mani
thing
what have you done

well
monsieur portho gave us a note for hi duchess order us to put it
in the post thi wa befor hi servant came as he could not leav
hi chamber it wa necessari to charg us with thi commiss
and then
instead of put the letter in the post which is never safe i took
advantag of the journei of on of my lad to pari and order him to
convei the letter to thi duchess himself thi wa fulfil the
intent of monsieur portho who had desir us to be so care of
thi letter wa it not
nearli so
well monsieur do you know who thi great ladi is

do you know who thi pretend duchess is
i repeat to you i dont know her
why she is the old wife of a procur of the chtelet monsieur
name madam coquenard who although she is at least fifti still
give herself jealou air it struck me as veri odd that a princess
should live in the rue aux our
attornei
but how do you know all thi
becaus she flew into a great passion on receiv the letter sai
that monsieur portho wa a weathercock and that she wa sure it wa
for some woman he had receiv thi wound
ha he been wound then
oh good lord what have i said
you said that portho had receiv a sword cut
ye but he ha forbidden me so strictli to sai so
and why so
zound monsieur becaus he had boast that he would perfor the
stranger with whom you left him in disput wherea the stranger on
the contrari in spite of all hi rodomontad quickli threw him on hi
back as monsieur portho is a veri boast man he insist that
nobodi shall know he ha receiv thi wound except the duchess whom
he endeavor to interest by an account of hi adventur
it is a wound that confin him to hi bed
ah and a master stroke too i assur you your friend soul must
stick tight to hi bodi
were you there then
monsieur i follow them from curios so that i saw the combat
without the combat see me
and what took place
oh the affair wa not long i assur you thei place themselv on
guard the stranger made a feint and a lung and that so rapidli that
when monsieur portho came to the parad he had alreadi three inch
of steel in hi breast he immedi fell backward the stranger
place the point of hi sword at hi throat and monsieur portho
find himself at the merci of hi adversari acknowledg himself
conquer upon which the stranger ask hi name and learn that it
wa portho and not dartagnan he assist him to rise brought him
back to the htel mount hi hors and disappear
so it wa with monsieur dartagnan thi stranger meant to quarrel
it appear so
and do you know what ha becom of him
no i never saw him until that moment and have not seen him sinc
veri well i know all that i wish to know porthoss chamber is you

oh monsieur procur wife or duchess if she will but loosen her
pursestr it will be all the same but she posit answer that
she wa tire of the exig and infidel of monsieur portho
and that she would not send him a denier
and did you convei thi answer to your guest
we took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion
we had execut hi commiss
so that he still expect hi monei
oh lord ye monsieur yesterdai he wrote again but it wa hi
servant who thi time put the letter in the post

as he saw the cathol extermin the huguenot and the huguenot
extermin the catholicsal in the name of religionh adopt a
mix belief which permit him to be sometim cathol sometim a
huguenot now he wa accustom to walk with hi fowl piec on hi

when he wa within ten pace of him he commenc a convers which
almost alwai end by the travel abandon hi purs to save hi

chapter xxvi
arami and hi thesi
dartagnan had said noth to portho of hi wound or of hi
procur wife our barnai wa a prudent lad howev young he
might be consequ he had appear to believ all that the
vainglori musket had told him convinc that no friendship will
hold out against a surpris secret besid we feel alwai a sort of
mental superior over those whose live we know better than thei
suppos in hi project of intrigu for the futur and determin as
he wa to make hi three friend the instrument of hi fortun
dartagnan wa not sorri at get into hi grasp beforehand the
invis string by which he reckon upon move them
and yet as he journei along a profound sad weigh upon hi
heart he thought of that young and pretti mme bonacieux who wa to
have paid him the price of hi devoted but let us hasten to sai
that thi sad possess the young man less from the regret of the
happi he had miss than from the fear he entertain that some
seriou misfortun had befallen the poor woman for himself he had no
doubt she wa a victim of the cardin vengeanc and as wa well
known the vengeanc of hi emin wa terribl how he had found
grace in the ey of the minist he did not know but without doubt
m de cavoi would have reveal thi to him if the captain of the
guard had found him at home
noth make time pass more quickli or more shorten a journei than a
thought which absorb in itself all the faculti of the organ
of him who think extern exist then resembl a sleep of which
thi thought is the dream by it influenc time ha no longer
measur space ha no longer distanc we depart from on place and
arriv at anoth that is all of the interv pass noth remain
in the memori but a vagu mist in which a thousand confus imag of
tree mountain and landscap ar lost it wa as a prei to thi
hallucin that dartagnan travel at whatev pace hi hors
pleas the six or eight leagu that separ chantilli from
crvecur without hi be abl to rememb on hi arriv in the
villag ani of the thing he had pass or met with on the road
there onli hi memori return to him he shook hi head perceiv the
cabaret at which he had left arami and put hi hors to the trot
he shortli pull up at the door
thi time it wa not a host but a hostess who receiv him dartagnan
wa a physiognomist hi ey took in at a glanc the plump cheer
counten of the mistress of the place and he at onc perceiv
there wa no occas for dissembl with her or of fear anyth
from on bless with such a joyou physiognomi
my good dame ask dartagnan can you tell me what ha becom of
on of my friend whom we were oblig to leav here about a dozen
dai ago
a handsom young man three or fourandtwenti year old mild
amiabl and well made
that is hewound in the shoulder
just so well monsieur he is still here
ah pardieu my dear dame said dartagnan spring from hi
hors and throw the bridl to planchet you restor me to life
where is thi dear arami let me embrac him i am in a hurri to see
him again
pardon monsieur but i doubt whether he can see you at thi moment
why so ha he a ladi with him
jesu what do you mean by that poor lad no monsieur he ha not a
ladi with him
with whom is he then
with the curat of montdidi and the superior of the jesuit of
amien
good heaven cri dartagnan is the poor fellow wors then
no monsieur quit the contrari but after hi ill grace touch
him and he determin to take order
that it said dartagnan i had forgotten that he wa onli a
musket for a time
monsieur still insist upon see him
more than ever
well monsieur ha onli to take the righthand staircas in the
courtyard and knock at number five on the second floor
dartagnan walk quickli in the direct indic and found on of
those exterior staircas that ar still to be seen in the yard of our
oldfashion tavern but there wa no get at the place of sojourn
of the futur abb the defil of the chamber of arami were as well
guard as the garden of armida bazin wa station in the corridor
and bar hi passag with the more intrepid that after mani year
of trial bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been
ambiti
in fact the dream of poor bazin had alwai been to serv a churchman
and he await with impati the moment alwai in the futur when
arami would throw asid the uniform and assum the cassock the
dailyrenew promis of the young man that the moment would not long
be delai had alon kept him in the servic of a musketeera servic
in which he said hi soul wa in constant jeopardi
bazin wa then at the height of joi in all probabl thi time hi
master would not retract the union of physic pain with moral
uneasi had produc the effect so long desir arami suffer
at onc in bodi and mind had at length fix hi ey and hi thought
upon religion and he had consid as a warn from heaven the
doubl accid which had happen to him that is to sai the sudden
disappear of hi mistress and the wound in hi shoulder
it mai be easili understood that in the present disposit of hi
master noth could be more disagre to bazin than the arriv of
dartagnan which might cast hi master back again into that vortex of
mundan affair which had so long carri him awai he resolv then
to defend the door brave and as betrai by the mistress of the
inn he could not sai that arami wa absent he endeavor to prove to
the newcom that it would be the height of indiscret to disturb hi
master in hi piou confer which had commenc with the morn
and would not as bazin said termin befor night
but dartagnan took veri littl heed of the eloqu discours of m
bazin and as he had no desir to support a polem discuss with hi
friend valet he simpli move him out of the wai with on hand and
with the other turn the handl of the door of number five the door
open and dartagnan went into the chamber
arami in a black gown hi head envelop in a sort of round flat
cap not much unlik a calott wa seat befor an oblong tabl
cover with roll of paper and enorm volum in folio at hi right
hand wa place the superior of the jesuit and on hi left the curat
of montdidi the curtain were half drawn and onli admit the
mysteri light calcul for beatif reveri all the mundan
object that gener strike the ey on enter the room of a young
man particularli when that young man is a musket had disappear
as if by enchant and for fear no doubt that the sight of them
might bring hi master back to idea of thi world bazin had laid hi
hand upon sword pistol plume hat and embroideri and lace of
all kind and sort in their stead dartagnan thought he perceiv in
an obscur corner a disciplin cord suspend from a nail in the wall
at the nois made by dartagnan in enter arami lift up hi head
and beheld hi friend but to the great astonish of the young man
the sight of him did not produc much effect upon the musket so
complet wa hi mind detach from the thing of thi world
good dai dear dartagnan said arami believ me i am glad to see
you
so am i delight to see you said dartagnan although i am not yet
sure that it is arami i am speak to
to himself my friend to himself but what make you doubt it
i wa afraid i had made a mistak in the chamber and that i had found
my wai into the apart of some churchman then anoth error seiz
me on see you in compani with these gentlemeni wa afraid you were
danger ill
the two men in black who guess dartagnan mean dart at him a
glanc which might have been thought threaten but dartagnan took
no heed of it
i disturb you perhap my dear arami continu dartagnan for by
what i see i am led to believ that you ar confess to these
gentlemen
arami color impercept you disturb me oh quit the contrari
dear friend i swear and as a proof of what i sai permit me to
declar i am rejoic to see you safe and sound
ah hell come round thought dartagnan that not bad
thi gentleman who is my friend ha just escap from a seriou
danger continu arami with unction point to dartagnan with
hi hand and address the two ecclesiast
prais god monsieur repli thei bow togeth
i have not fail to do so your rever repli the young man
return their salut
you arriv in good time dear dartagnan said arami and by take
part in our discuss mai assist us with your intellig monsieur
the princip of amien monsieur the curat of montdidi and i ar
argu certain theolog question in which we have been much
interest i shall be delight to have your opinion
the opinion of a swordsman can have veri littl weight repli
dartagnan who began to be uneasi at the turn thing were take and
you had better be satisfi believ me with the knowledg of these
gentlemen
the two men in black bow in their turn
on the contrari repli arami your opinion will be veri valuabl
the question is thi monsieur the princip think that my thesi
ought to be dogmat and didact
your thesi ar you then make a thesi
without doubt repli the jesuit in the examin which preced
ordin a thesi is alwai a requisit
ordin cri dartagnan who could not believ what the hostess
and bazin had success told him and he gaze half stupefi upon
the three person befor him
now continu arami take the same grace posit in hi easi
chair that he would have assum in bed and complac examin hi
hand which wa as white and plump as that of a woman and which he
held in the air to caus the blood to descend now as you have heard
dartagnan monsieur the princip is desir that my thesi should be
dogmat while i for my part would rather it should be ideal thi
is the reason why monsieur the princip ha propos to me the
follow subject which ha not yet been treat upon and in which i
perceiv there is matter for magnific elaborationutraqu manu in
benedicendo clerici inferioribu necessaria est
dartagnan whose erudit we ar well acquaint with evinc no
more interest on hear thi quotat than he had at that of m de
trvill in allus to the gift he pretend that dartagnan had
receiv from the duke of buckingham
which mean resum arami that he might perfectli understand
the two hand ar indispens for priest of the inferior order
when thei bestow the benedict
an admir subject cri the jesuit
admir and dogmat repeat the curat who about as strong as
dartagnan with respect to latin carefulli watch the jesuit in order
to keep step with him and repeat hi word like an echo
as to dartagnan he remain perfectli insens to the enthusiasm of
the two men in black
ye admir prorsu admirabil continu arami but which
requir a profound studi of both the scriptur and the father now
i have confess to these learn ecclesiast and that in all
humil that the duti of mount guard and the servic of the king
have caus me to neglect studi a littl i should find myself
therefor more at my eas faciliu natan in a subject of my own
choic which would be to these hard theolog question what moral
ar to metaphys in philosophi
dartagnan began to be tire and so did the curat
see what an exordium cri the jesuit
exordium repeat the curat for the sake of sai someth
quemadmodum inter clorum immensitatem
arami cast a glanc upon dartagnan to see what effect all thi
produc and found hi friend gape enough to split hi jaw

finger the pope therefor bless with the finger and with how
mani finger doe he bless with three finger to be sureon for
the father on for the son and on for the holi ghost

hierarchi bless in the name of the holi archangel and angel the most
humbl clerk such as our deacon and sacristan bless with holi water
sprinkler which resembl an infinit number of bless finger
there is the subject simplifi argumentum omni denudatum ornamento
i could make of that subject two volum the size of thi continu
the jesuit and in hi enthusiasm he struck a st chrysostom in folio
which made the tabl bend beneath it weight
dartagnan trembl
cert said arami i do justic to the beauti of thi thesi
but at the same time i perceiv it would be overwhelm for me i had
chosen thi texttel me dear dartagnan if it is not to your
tastenon inutil est desiderium in oblation that is a littl
regret is not unsuit in an offer to the lord
stop there cri the jesuit for that thesi touch close upon
heresi there is a proposit almost like it in the augustinu of
the heresiarch janseniu whose book will sooner or later be burn by
the hand of the execution take care my young friend you ar
inclin toward fals doctrin my young friend you will be lost
you will be lost said the curat shake hi head sorrowfulli
you approach that famou point of free will which is a mortal rock
you face the insinu of the pelagian and the semipelagian
but my reverend repli arami a littl amaz by the shower of
argument that pour upon hi head
how will you prove continu the jesuit without allow him time
to speak that we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselv to
god listen to thi dilemma god is god and the world is the devil to
regret the world is to regret the devil that is my conclus
and that is mine also said the curat
but for heaven sake resum arami
desidera diabolum unhappi man cri the jesuit

groan do not regret the devil i implor you
dartagnan felt himself bewild it seem to him as though he were
in a madhous and wa becom as mad as those he saw he wa
howev forc to hold hi tongu from not comprehend half the
languag thei emploi
but listen to me then resum arami with polit mingl with a
littl impati i do not sai i regret no i will never pronounc
that sentenc which would not be orthodox
the jesuit rais hi hand toward heaven and the curat did the same
no but prai grant me that it is act with an ill grace to offer to
the lord onli that with which we ar perfectli disgust dont you
think so dartagnan
i think so inde cri he
the jesuit and the curat quit start from their chair

want in attract i quit the world then i make a sacrific now

and then said arami pinch hi ear to make it red as he rub
hi hand to make them white and then i made a certain rondeau upon
it last year which i show to monsieur voitur and that great man
paid me a thousand compliment

chang

howev wa not exempt from a shade of hypocrisi
vou qui pleurez un pass plein de charm
et qui trainez de jour infortun
tou vo malheur se verront termin
quand dieu seul vou offrirez vo larm

you who weep for pleasur fled
while drag on a life of care
all your woe will melt in air
if to god your tear ar shed
you who weep
dartagnan and the curat appear pleas the jesuit persist in hi
opinion bewar of a profan tast in your theolog style what

how wa he go to find atho should he find him at all the posit
in which he had left him wa critic he probabl had succumb thi
idea while darken hi brow drew sever sigh from him and caus
him to formul to himself a few vow of vengeanc of all hi

yet he entertain a mark prefer for thi gentleman the nobl
and distinguish air of atho those flash of great which from
time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarili kept
himself that unalter equal of temper which made him the most
pleasant companion in the world that forc and cynic gaieti that
braveri which might have been term blind if it had not been the
result of the rarest coolnesssuch qualiti attract more than the
esteem more than the friendship of dartagnan thei attract hi
admir
inde when place besid m de trvill the eleg and nobl
courtier atho in hi most cheer dai might advantag sustain
a comparison he wa of middl height but hi person wa so admir
shape and so well proport that more than onc in hi struggl
with portho he had overcom the giant whose physic strength wa
proverbi among the musket hi head with pierc ey a
straight nose a chin cut like that of brutu had altogeth an

took littl care were the despair of arami who cultiv hi with
almond past and perfum oil the sound of hi voic wa at onc
penetr and melodi and then that which wa inconceiv in
atho who wa alwai retir wa that delic knowledg of the
world and of the usag of the most brilliant societythos manner of
a high degre which appear as if unconsci to himself in hi
least action
if a repast were on foot atho presid over it better than ani other

like all the great nobl of that period atho rode and fenc to

neglect even with respect to scholast studi so rare at thi
time among gentlemen that he smile at the scrap of latin which
arami sport and which portho pretend to understand two or three

arami allow some rudiment error to escap him replac a verb in

dartagnan whose inquir disposit we ar acquaint with had
notwhatev interest he had in satisfi hi curios on thi
subjectbeen abl to assign ani caus for these fit or for the
period of their recurr atho never receiv ani letter atho
never had concern which all hi friend did not know
it could not be said that it wa wine which produc thi sad for
in truth he onli drank to combat thi sad which wine howev as
we have said render still darker thi excess of biliou humor could
not be attribut to plai for unlik portho who accompani the
variat of chanc with song or oath atho when he won remain as
unmov as when he lost he had been known in the circl of the
musket to win in on night three thousand pistol to lose them

neither wa it as with our neighbor the english an atmospher

becam more intens toward the fine season of the year june and juli
were the terribl month with atho
for the present he had no anxieti he shrug hi shoulder when
peopl spoke of the futur hi secret then wa in the past as had
often been vagu said to dartagnan
thi mysteri shade spread over hi whole person render still
more interest the man whose ey or mouth even in the most complet
intox had never reveal anyth howev skillfulli question
had been put to him
well thought dartagnan poor atho is perhap at thi moment dead
and dead by my faultfor it wa i who drag him into thi affair of
which he did not know the origin of which he is ignor of the
result and from which he can deriv no advantag
without reckon monsieur ad planchet to hi master audibl
express reflect that we perhap ow our live to him do you
rememb how he cri on dartagnan on i am taken and when he
had discharg hi two pistol what a terribl nois he made with hi
sword on might have said that twenti men or rather twenti mad
devil were fight
these word redoubl the eager of dartagnan who urg hi hors
though he stood in need of no incit and thei proceed at a rapid
pace about eleven oclock in the morn thei perceiv amien and at
half past eleven thei were at the door of the curs inn
dartagnan had often medit against the perfidi host on of those
hearti vengeanc which offer consol while thei ar hope for he
enter the hostelri with hi hat pull over hi ey hi left hand
on the pommel of the sword and crack hi whip with hi right hand
do you rememb me said he to the host who advanc to greet him
i have not that honor monseigneur repli the latter hi ey

pitiabl voic imagin ah monseigneur how dearli have i paid for
that fault unhappi wretch as i am
that gentleman i sai what ha becom of him
deign to listen to me monseigneur and be merci sit down in
merci
dartagnan mute with anger and anxieti took a seat in the threaten
attitud of a judg planchet glare fierc over the back of hi
armchair
here is the stori monseigneur resum the trembl host for i
now recollect you it wa you who rode off at the moment i had that
unfortun differ with the gentleman you speak of

expect if you do not tell me the whole truth
condescend to listen to me and you shall know all

i had been warn by the author that a celebr coiner of bad
monei would arriv at my inn with sever of hi companion all
disguis as guard or musket monseigneur i wa furnish with a
descript of your hors your lackei your countenancesnoth wa

go on go on said dartagnan who quickli understood whenc such an
exact descript had come
i took then in conform with the order of the author who
sent me a reinforc of six men such measur as i thought
necessari to get possess of the person of the pretend coiner
again said dartagnan whose ear chafe terribl under the
repetit of thi word coiner

should enter the compani of the musket
as thi wa the height of dartagnan worldli ambitionapart be it
well understood from hi desir of find mme bonacieuxh ran full
of joi to seek hi comrad whom he had left onli half an hour
befor but whom he found veri sad and deepli preoccupi thei were
assembl in council at the resid of atho which alwai indic
an event of some graviti m de trvill had intim to them hi
majesti fix intent to open the campaign on the first of mai and
thei must immedi prepar their outfit
the four philosoph look at on anoth in a state of bewilder
m de trvill never jest in matter relat to disciplin
and what do you reckon your outfit will cost said dartagnan
oh we can scarc sai we have made our calcul with spartan
economi and we each requir fifteen hundr livr
four time fifteen make sixtysix thousand livr said atho
it seem to me said dartagnan with a thousand livr eachi do
not speak as a spartan but as a procur
thi word procur rous portho stop said he i have an
idea
well that someth for i have not the shadow of on said atho
coolli but as to dartagnan gentlemen the idea of belong to

beauti ring which beam from the finger of our friend what the
devil dartagnan is too good a comrad to leav hi brother in
embarrass while he wear the ransom of a king on hi finger
chapter xxix
hunt for the equip
the most preoccupi of the four friend wa certainli dartagnan
although he in hi qualiti of guardsman would be much more easili
equip than messieur the musket who were all of high rank but
our gascon cadet wa as mai have been observ of a provid and
almost avarici charact and with that explain the contradict
so vain as almost to rival portho to thi preoccup of hi
vaniti dartagnan at thi moment join an uneasi much less
selfish notwithstand all hi inquiri respect mme bonacieux
he could obtain no intellig of her m de trvill had spoken of
her to the queen the queen wa ignor where the mercer young wife
wa but had promis to have her sought for but thi promis wa veri
vagu and did not at all reassur dartagnan
atho did not leav hi chamber he made up hi mind not to take a
singl step to equip himself
we have still fifteen dai befor us said he to hi friend well
if at the end of a fortnight i have found noth or rather if noth
ha come to find me as i too good a cathol to kill myself with a
pistol bullet i will seek a good quarrel with four of hi emin
guard or with eight englishmen and i will fight until on of them ha
kill me which consid the number cannot fail to happen it
will then be said of me that i di for the king so that i shall have
perform my duti without the expens of an outfit
portho continu to walk about with hi hand behind him toss hi
head and repeat i shall follow up on my idea
arami anxiou and neglig dress said noth
it mai be seen by these disastr detail that desol reign in
the commun
the lackei on their part like the courser of hippolytu share the
sad of their master mousqueton collect a store of crust
bazin who had alwai been inclin to devot never quit the
church planchet watch the flight of fli and grimaud whom the
gener distress could not induc to break the silenc impos by hi
master heav sigh enough to soften the stone
the three friendsfor as we have said atho had sworn not to stir a
foot to equip himselfw out earli in the morn and return late
at night thei wander about the street look at the pavement as
if to see whether the passeng had not left a purs behind them thei
might have been suppos to be follow track so observ were thei
wherev thei went when thei met thei look desol at on
anoth as much as to sai have you found anyth
howev as portho had first found an idea and had thought of it
earnestli afterward he wa the first to act he wa a man of
execut thi worthi portho dartagnan perceiv him on dai
walk toward the church of st leu and follow him instinct
he enter after have twist hi mustach and elong hi
imperi which alwai announc on hi part the most triumphant
resolut as dartagnan took some precaut to conceal himself
portho believ he had not been seen dartagnan enter behind him
portho went and lean against the side of a pillar dartagnan still
unperceiv support himself against the other side
there happen to be a sermon which made the church veri full of
peopl portho took advantag of thi circumst to ogl the women
thank to the care of mousqueton the exterior wa far from announc
the distress of the interior hi hat wa a littl napless hi feather
wa a littl fade hi gold lace wa a littl tarnish hi lace
were a trifl frai but in the obscur of the church these thing
were not seen and portho wa still the handsom portho
dartagnan observ on the bench nearest to the pillar against which
portho lean a sort of ripe beauti rather yellow and rather dry
but erect and haughti under her black hood the ey of portho were
furtiv cast upon thi ladi and then rove about at larg over the
nave
on her side the ladi who from time to time blush dart with the
rapid of lightn a glanc toward the inconst portho and then
immedi the ey of portho wander anxious it wa plain that
thi mode of proceed piqu the ladi in the black hood for she bit
her lip till thei bled scratch the end of her nose and could not
sit still in her seat
portho see thi retwist hi mustach elong hi imperi a
second time and began to make signal to a beauti ladi who wa near
the choir and who not onli wa a beauti ladi but still further no
doubt a great ladyfor she had behind her a negro boi who had brought
the cushion on which she knelt and a femal servant who held the
emblazon bag in which wa place the book from which she read the
mass
the ladi with the black hood follow through all their wander the
look of portho and perceiv that thei rest upon the ladi with the
velvet cushion the littl negro and the maidserv
dure thi time portho plai close it wa almost impercept
motion of hi ey finger place upon the lip littl assassin
smile which realli did assassin the disdain beauti
then she cri ahem under cover of the mea culpa strike her
breast so vigor that everybodi even the ladi with the red
cushion turn round toward her portho paid no attent
nevertheless he understood it all but wa deaf
the ladi with the red cushion produc a great effectfor she wa veri
handsomeupon the ladi with the black hood who saw in her a rival
realli to be dread a great effect upon portho who thought her much
prettier than the ladi with the black hood a great effect upon
dartagnan who recogn in her the ladi of meung of calai and of
dover whom hi persecutor the man with the scar had salut by the
name of miladi
dartagnan without lose sight of the ladi of the red cushion
continu to watch the proceed of portho which amus him
greatli he guess that the ladi of the black hood wa the
procur wife of the rue aux our which wa the more probabl from
the church of st leu be not far from that local
he guess likewis by induct that portho wa take hi reveng
for the defeat of chantilli when the procur wife had prove so
refractori with respect to her purs
amid all thi dartagnan remark also that not on counten
respond to the gallantri of portho there were onli chimera and
illus but for real love for true jealousi is there ani realiti
except illus and chimera
the sermon over the procur wife advanc toward the holi font
portho went befor her and instead of a finger dip hi whole hand
in the procur wife smile think that it wa for her portho
had put himself to thi troubl but she wa cruelli and promptli
undeceiv when she wa onli about three step from him he turn hi
head round fix hi ey steadfastli upon the ladi with the red
cushion who had risen and wa approach follow by her black boi
and her woman
when the ladi of the red cushion came close to portho portho drew
hi drip hand from the font the fair worshipp touch the great
hand of portho with her delic finger smile made the sign of the
cross and left the church
thi wa too much for the procur wife she doubt not there wa
an intrigu between thi ladi and portho if she had been a great ladi
she would have faint but as she wa onli a procur wife she
content herself sai to the musket with concentr furi eh
monsieur portho you dont offer me ani holi water

the convers between miladi and the cavali wa so anim that
dartagnan stop on the other side of the carriag without anyon but
the pretti soubrett perceiv hi presenc
the convers took place in englisha languag which dartagnan
could not understand but by the accent the young man plainli saw that
the beauti englishwoman wa in a great rage she termin it by an
action which left no doubt as to the natur of thi convers thi
wa a blow with her fan appli with such forc that the littl
feminin weapon flew into a thousand piec

prevent the quarrel from go too far but on the contrari she threw
herself back in her carriag and call out coolli to the coachman
go onhom
the pretti soubrett cast an anxiou glanc at dartagnan whose good

fell backward
dartagnan wa over him at a bound and said to the englishman

dartagnan wa at the height of joi he had realiz the plan he had

upon hi face
the englishman delight at have to do with a gentleman of such a
kind disposit press dartagnan in hi arm and paid a thousand
compliment to the three musket and as porthoss adversari wa
alreadi instal in the carriag and as aramiss had taken to hi

you i will present you to my sister miladi clarik for i am desir
that she should take you into her good grace and as she is not in bad
odor at court she mai perhap on some futur dai speak a word that
will not prove useless to you
dartagnan blush with pleasur and bow a sign of assent
at thi time atho came up to dartagnan
what do you mean to do with that purs whisper he
why i meant to pass it over to you my dear atho
me why to me
why you kill him thei ar the spoil of victori

custom in a duel
even on the field of battl i have never done that
portho shrug hi shoulder arami by a movement of hi lip
endors atho
then said dartagnan let us give the monei to the lackei as lord
de winter desir us to do
ye said atho let us give the monei to the lackeysnot to our

atho took the purs and threw it into the hand of the coachman for

thi great of spirit in a man who wa quit destitut struck even
portho and thi french generos repeat by lord de winter and hi
friend wa highli applaud except by mm grimaud bazin mousqueton
and planchet
lord de winter on quit dartagnan gave him hi sister address
she live in the place royalethen the fashion quarterat number 6
and he undertook to call and take dartagnan with him in order to
introduc him dartagnan appoint eight oclock at athoss resid
thi introduct to miladi clarik occupi the head of our gascon
greatli he rememb in what a strang manner thi woman had hitherto
been mix up in hi destini accord to hi convict she wa some
creatur of the cardin and yet he felt himself invinc drawn
toward her by on of those sentiment for which we cannot account hi
onli fear wa that miladi would recogn in him the man of meung and
of dover then she knew that he wa on of the friend of m de
trvill and consequ that he belong bodi and soul to the king
which would make him lose a part of hi advantag sinc when known to
miladi as he knew her he plai onli an equal game with her as to the
commenc of an intrigu between her and m de ward our
presumptu hero gave but littl heed to that although the marqui
wa young handsom rich and high in the cardin favor it is not
for noth we ar but twenti year old abov all if we were born at
tarb
dartagnan began by make hi most splendid toilet then return to
athoss and accord to custom relat everyth to him atho
listen to hi project then shook hi head and recommend prudenc
to him with a shade of bitter
what said he you have just lost on woman whom you call good
charm perfect and here you ar run headlong after anoth
dartagnan felt the truth of thi reproach
i love madam bonacieux with my heart while i onli love miladi with
my head said he in get introduc to her my princip object
is to ascertain what part she plai at court
the part she plai pardieu it is not difficult to divin that
after all you have told me she is some emissari of the cardin a
woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leav your
head
the devil my dear atho you view thing on the dark side methink
my dear fellow i mistrust women can it be otherwis i bought my
experi dearlyparticularli fair women miladi is fair you sai
she ha the most beauti light hair imagin
ah my poor dartagnan said atho
listen to me i want to be enlighten on a subject then when i
shall have learn what i desir to know i will withdraw
be enlighten said atho phlegmat
lord de winter arriv at the appoint time but atho be warn
of hi come went into the other chamber he therefor found
dartagnan alon and as it wa nearli eight oclock he took the young
man with him
an eleg carriag wait below and as it wa drawn by two excel
hors thei were soon at the place royal
miladi clarik receiv dartagnan ceremoni her htel wa
remark sumptuou and while the most part of the english had quit
or were about to quit franc on account of the war miladi had just
been lai out much monei upon her resid which prove that the
gener measur which drove the english from franc did not affect her
you see said lord de winter present dartagnan to hi sister a
young gentleman who ha held my life in hi hand and who ha not
abus hi advantag although we have been twice enemi although it
wa i who insult him and although i am an englishman thank him
then madam if you have ani affect for me
miladi frown slightli a scarc visibl cloud pass over her brow
and so peculiar a smile appear upon her lip that the young man who
saw and observ thi tripl shade almost shudder at it
the brother did not perceiv thi he had turn round to plai with
miladi favorit monkei which had pull him by the doublet
you ar welcom monsieur said miladi in a voic whose singular
sweet contrast with the symptom of illhumor which dartagnan
had just remark you have todai acquir etern right to my
gratitud
the englishman then turn round and describ the combat without
omit a singl detail miladi listen with the greatest attent
and yet it wa easili to be perceiv whatev effort she made to
conceal her impress that thi recit wa not agreeabl to her
the blood rose to her head and her littl foot work with impati
beneath her robe
lord de winter perceiv noth of thi when he had finish he went
to a tabl upon which wa a salver with spanish wine and glass he
fill two glass and by a sign invit dartagnan to drink
dartagnan knew it wa consid disoblig by an englishman to
refus to pledg him he therefor drew near to the tabl and took the
second glass he did not howev lose sight of miladi and in a
mirror he perceiv the chang that came over her face now that she
believ herself to be no longer observ a sentiment resembl
feroc anim her counten she bit her handkerchief with her
beauti teeth
that pretti littl soubrett whom dartagnan had alreadi observ
then came in she spoke some word to lord de winter in english who
thereupon request dartagnan permiss to retir excus himself
on account of the urgenc of the busi that had call him awai and
charg hi sister to obtain hi pardon
dartagnan exchang a shake of the hand with lord de winter and then
return to miladi her counten with surpris mobil had
recov it graciou express but some littl red spot on her
handkerchief indic that she had bitten her lip till the blood
came those lip were magnific thei might be said to be of coral
the convers took a cheer turn miladi appear to have entir
recov she told dartagnan that lord de winter wa her
brotherinlaw and not her brother she had marri a younger brother
of the famili who had left her a widow with on child thi child wa
the onli heir to lord de winter if lord de winter did not marri all
thi show dartagnan that there wa a veil which conceal someth
but he could not yet see under thi veil
in addit to thi after a half hour convers dartagnan wa
convinc that miladi wa hi compatriot she spoke french with an
eleg and a puriti that left no doubt on that head
dartagnan wa profus in gallant speech and protest of
devot to all the simpl thing which escap our gascon miladi
repli with a smile of kind the hour came for him to retir
dartagnan took leav of miladi and left the saloon the happiest of
men
on the staircas he met the pretti soubrett who brush gentli
against him as she pass and then blush to the ey ask hi
pardon for have touch him in a voic so sweet that the pardon wa
grant instantli
dartagnan came again on the morrow and wa still better receiv than
on the even befor lord de winter wa not at home and it wa
miladi who thi time did all the honor of the even she appear to
take a great interest in him ask him whenc he came who were hi
friend and whether he had not sometim thought of attach himself
to the cardin
dartagnan who as we have said wa exceedingli prudent for a young
man of twenti then rememb hi suspicion regard miladi he
launch into a eulogi of hi emin and said that he should not
have fail to enter into the guard of the cardin instead of the
king guard if he had happen to know m de cavoi instead of m de
trvill
miladi chang the convers without ani appear of affect
and ask dartagnan in the most careless manner possibl if he had
ever been in england
dartagnan repli that he had been sent thither by m de trvill to
treat for a suppli of hors and that he had brought back four as
specimen
miladi in the cours of the convers twice or thrice bit her lip
she had to deal with a gascon who plai close
at the same hour as on the preced even dartagnan retir in
the corridor he again met the pretti kitti that wa the name of the
soubrett she look at him with an express of kind which it
wa imposs to mistak but dartagnan wa so preoccupi by the
mistress that he notic absolut noth but her
dartagnan came again on the morrow and the dai after that and each
dai miladi gave him a more graciou recept
everi even either in the antechamb the corridor or on the
stair he met the pretti soubrett but as we have said dartagnan
paid no attent to thi persist of poor kitti

and what sort of reveng would you take
i would triumph over her and supplant my rival
i will never help you in that monsieur chevali said kitti
warmli
and why not demand dartagnan
for two reason

i in what can i have offend heri who ever sinc i have known her
have live at her feet like a slave speak i beg you

poor girl becam as red as a cherri
oh no said kitti it is not me you love it is my mistress you
love you told me so just now
and doe that hinder you from let me know the second reason
the second reason monsieur the chevali repli kitti embolden
by the kiss in the first place and still further by the express of
the ey of the young man is that in love everyon for herself
then onli dartagnan rememb the languish glanc of kitti her
constantli meet him in the antechamb the corridor or on the
stair those touch of the hand everi time she met him and her deep
sigh but absorb by hi desir to pleas the great ladi he had
disdain the soubrett he whose game is the eagl take no heed of
the sparrow
but thi time our gascon saw at a glanc all the advantag to be
deriv from the love which kitti had just confess so innoc or
so boldli the intercept of letter address to the comt de
ward new on the spot entranc at all hour into kitti chamber
which wa contigu to her mistresss the perfidi deceiv wa as
mai plainli be perceiv alreadi sacrif in intent the poor
girl in order to obtain miladi willynilli

in an easi chair come and let me tell you that you ar the prettiest
soubrett i ever saw
and he did tell her so much and so well that the poor girl who ask
noth better than to believ him did believ him nevertheless to
dartagnan great astonish the pretti kitti defend herself
resolut
time pass quickli when it is pass in attack and defens midnight
sound and almost at the same time the bell wa rung in miladi
chamber
good god cri kitti there is my mistress call me go go
directli
dartagnan rose took hi hat as if it had been hi intent to obei
then open quickli the door of a larg closet instead of that
lead to the staircas he buri himself amid the robe and dress
gown of miladi
what ar you do cri kitti
dartagnan who had secur the kei shut himself up in the closet
without repli
well cri miladi in a sharp voic ar you asleep that you dont
answer when i ring
and dartagnan heard the door of commun open violent
here am i miladi here am i cri kitti spring forward to meet
her mistress
both went into the bedroom and as the door of commun remain
open dartagnan could hear miladi for some time scold her maid she
wa at length appeas and the convers turn upon him while
kitti wa assist her mistress
well said miladi i have not seen our gascon thi even
what miladi ha he not come said kitti can he be inconst
befor be happi
oh no he must have been prevent by monsieur de trvill or
monsieur dessessart i understand my game kitti i have thi on
safe
what will you do with him madam
what will i do with him be easi kitti there is someth between
that man and me that he is quit ignor of he nearli made me lose my
credit with hi emin oh i will be reveng
i believ that madam love him
i love him i detest him an idiot who held the life of lord de
winter in hi hand and did not kill him by which i miss three
hundr thousand livr incom
that true said kitti your son wa the onli heir of hi uncl
and until hi major you would have had the enjoy of hi
fortun
dartagnan shudder to the marrow at hear thi suav creatur
reproach him with that sharp voic which she took such pain to
conceal in convers for not have kill a man whom he had seen
load her with kind
for all thi continu miladi i should long ago have reveng
myself on him if and i dont know why the cardin had not request
me to concili him
oh ye but madam ha not concili that littl woman he wa so
fond of
what the mercer wife of the rue de fossoyeur ha he not alreadi
forgotten she ever exist fine vengeanc that on my faith
a cold sweat broke from dartagnan brow why thi woman wa a
monster he resum hi listen but unfortun the toilet wa
finish
that will do said miladi go into your own room and tomorrow
endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you
for monsieur de ward said kitti
to be sure for monsieur de ward
now there is on said kitti who appear to me quit a differ
sort of a man from that poor monsieur dartagnan
go to bed mademoisel said miladi i dont like comment
dartagnan heard the door close then the nois of two bolt by which
miladi fasten herself in on her side but as softli as possibl
kitti turn the kei of the lock and then dartagnan open the closet
door
oh good lord said kitti in a low voic what is the matter with
you how pale you ar
the abomin creatur murmur dartagnan
silenc silenc begon said kitti there is noth but a
wainscot between my chamber and miladi everi word that is utter in
on can be heard in the other
that exactli the reason i wont go said dartagnan
what said kitti blush
or at least i will golat
he drew kitti to him she had the less motiv to resist resist
would make so much nois therefor kitti surrend
it wa a movement of vengeanc upon miladi dartagnan believ it
right to sai that vengeanc is the pleasur of the god with a littl
more heart he might have been content with thi new conquest but
the princip featur of hi charact were ambit and pride it
must howev be confess in hi justif that the first us he
made of hi influenc over kitti wa to try and find out what had
becom of mme bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to
dartagnan that she wa entir ignor on that head her mistress
never admit her into half her secretsonli she believ she could
sai she wa not dead
as to the caus which wa near make miladi lose her credit with the
cardin kitti knew noth about it but thi time dartagnan wa
better inform than she wa as he had seen miladi on board a vessel
at the moment he wa leav england he suspect that it wa almost
without a doubt on account of the diamond stud
but what wa clearest in all thi wa that the true hatr the
profound hatr the inveter hatr of miladi wa increas by hi
not have kill her brotherinlaw
dartagnan came the next dai to miladi and find her in a veri
illhumor had no doubt that it wa lack of an answer from m de ward
that provok her thu kitti came in but miladi wa veri cross with
her the poor girl ventur a glanc at dartagnan which said see how
i suffer on your account
toward the end of the even howev the beauti lioness becam
milder she smilingli listen to the soft speech of dartagnan and
even gave him her hand to kiss
dartagnan depart scarc know what to think but as he wa a
youth who did not easili lose hi head while continu to pai hi
court to miladi he had frame a littl plan in hi mind
he found kitti at the gate and as on the preced even went up
to her chamber kitti had been accus of neglig and sever
scold miladi could not at all comprehend the silenc of the comt de
ward and she order kitti to come at nine oclock in the morn to
take a third letter
dartagnan made kitti promis to bring him that letter on the follow
morn the poor girl promis all her lover desir she wa mad
thing pass as on the night befor dartagnan conceal himself in
hi closet miladi call undress sent awai kitti and shut the
door as the night befor dartagnan did not return home till five
oclock in the morn
at eleven oclock kitti came to him she held in her hand a fresh
billet from miladi thi time the poor girl did not even argu with
dartagnan she gave it to him at onc she belong bodi and soul to
her handsom soldier
dartagnan open the letter and read as follow
thi is the third time i have written to you to tell you that i love
you bewar that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i
detest you
if you repent of the manner in which you have act toward me the
young girl who bring you thi will tell you how a man of spirit
mai obtain hi pardon
dartagnan color and grew pale sever time in read thi billet
oh you love her still said kitti who had not taken her ey off
the young man counten for an instant
no kitti you ar mistaken i do not love her but i will aveng
myself for her contempt
oh ye i know what sort of vengeanc you told me that
what matter it to you kitti you know it is you alon whom i love
how can i know that
by the scorn i will throw upon her
dartagnan took a pen and wrote
madam until the present moment i could not believ that it wa to me
your first two letter were address so unworthi did i feel myself of
such an honor besid i wa so serious indispos that i could not
in ani case have repli to them
but now i am forc to believ in the excess of your kind
sinc not onli your letter but your servant assur me that i have
the good fortun to be belov by you
she ha no occas to teach me the wai in which a man of spirit
mai obtain hi pardon i will come and ask mine at eleven oclock
thi even
to delai it a singl dai would be in my ey now to commit a fresh
offens
from him whom you have render the happiest of men
comt de ward
thi note wa in the first place a forgeri it wa likewis an
indelicaci it wa even accord to our present manner someth
like an infam action but at that period peopl did not manag
affair as thei do todai besid dartagnan from her own admiss
knew miladi culpabl of treacheri in matter more import and could
entertain no respect for her and yet notwithstand thi want of
respect he felt an uncontrol passion for thi woman boil in
hi veinspass drunk with contempt but passion or thirst as the
reader pleas
dartagnan plan wa veri simpl by kitti chamber he could gain
that of her mistress he would take advantag of the first moment of
surpris shame and terror to triumph over her he might fail but
someth must be left to chanc in eight dai the campaign would
open and he would be compel to leav pari dartagnan had no time
for a prolong love sieg
there said the young man hand kitti the letter seal give
that to miladi it is the count repli
poor kitti becam as pale as death she suspect what the letter
contain
listen my dear girl said dartagnan you cannot but perceiv that
all thi must end some wai or other miladi mai discov that you gave
the first billet to my lackei instead of to the count that it is i
who have open the other which ought to have been open by de
ward miladi will then turn you out of door and you know she is not
the woman to limit her vengeanc
ala said kitti for whom have i expos myself to all that
for me i well know my sweet girl said dartagnan but i am
grate i swear to you
but what doe thi note contain
miladi will tell you
ah you do not love me cri kitti and i am veri wretch
to thi reproach there is alwai on respons which delud women
dartagnan repli in such a manner that kitti remain in her great
delus although she cri freeli befor decid to transmit the
letter to her mistress she did at last so decid which wa all
dartagnan wish final he promis that he would leav her
mistresss presenc at an earli hour that even and that when he
left the mistress he would ascend with the maid thi promis complet
poor kitti consol

nine oclock he found her in a charm humor never had he been so
well receiv our gascon knew by the first glanc of hi ey that
hi billet had been deliv and that thi billet had had it effect
kitti enter to bring some sherbet her mistress put on a charm
face and smile on her gracious but ala the poor girl wa so sad
that she did not even notic miladi condescens
dartagnan look at the two women on after the other and wa forc
to acknowledg that in hi opinion dame natur had made a mistak in
their format to the great ladi she had given a heart vile and
venal to the soubrett she had given the heart of a duchess
at ten oclock miladi began to appear restless dartagnan knew what
she want she look at the clock rose reseat herself smile at
dartagnan with an air which said you ar veri amiabl no doubt but
you would be charm if you would onli depart
dartagnan rose and took hi hat miladi gave him her hand to kiss the
young man felt her press hi hand and comprehend that thi wa a
sentiment not of coquetri but of gratitud becaus of hi departur
she love him devilishli he murmur then he went out
thi time kitti wa nowher wait for him neither in the
antechamb nor in the corridor nor beneath the great door it wa
necessari that dartagnan should find alon the staircas and the
littl chamber she heard him enter but she did not rais her head
the young man went to her and took her hand then she sob aloud
as dartagnan had presum on receiv hi letter miladi in a
delirium of joi had told her servant everyth and by wai of
recompens for the manner in which she had thi time execut the
commiss she had given kitti a purs

where it lai open disgorg three or four gold piec on the carpet
the poor girl under the caress of dartagnan lift her head
dartagnan himself wa frighten by the chang in her counten she
join her hand with a suppliant air but without ventur to speak a
word as littl sensit as wa the heart of dartagnan he wa
touch by thi mute sorrow but he held too tenaci to hi
project abov all to thi on to chang the program which he had
laid out in advanc he did not therefor allow her ani hope that he
would flinch onli he repres hi action as on of simpl
vengeanc
for the rest thi vengeanc wa veri easi for miladi doubtless to
conceal her blush from her lover had order kitti to extinguish all
the light in the apart and even in the littl chamber itself
befor daybreak m de ward must take hi departur still in
obscur
present thei heard miladi retir to her room dartagnan slip into
the wardrob hardli wa he conceal when the littl bell sound
kitti went to her mistress and did not leav the door open but the
partit wa so thin that on could hear nearli all that pass
between the two women
miladi seem overcom with joi and made kitti repeat the smallest
detail of the pretend interview of the soubrett with de ward
when he receiv the letter how he had respond what wa the
express of hi face if he seem veri amor and to all these
question poor kitti forc to put on a pleasant face respond in a
stifl voic whose dolor accent her mistress did not howev
remark sole becaus happi is egotist
final as the hour for her interview with the count approach
miladi had everyth about her darken and order kitti to return
to her own chamber and introduc de ward whenev he present
himself
kitti detent wa not long hardli had dartagnan seen through a
crevic in hi closet that the whole apart wa in obscur than
he slip out of hi conceal at the veri moment when kitti
reclos the door of commun
what is that nois demand miladi
it is i said dartagnan in a subdu voic i the comt de
ward
oh my god my god murmur kitti he ha not even wait for the
hour he himself name
well said miladi in a trembl voic why do you not enter
count count ad she you know that i wait for you
at thi appeal dartagnan drew kitti quietli awai and slip into the
chamber
if rage or sorrow ever tortur the heart it is when a lover receiv
under a name which is not hi own protest of love address to
hi happi rival dartagnan wa in a dolor situat which he had
not foreseen jealousi gnaw hi heart and he suffer almost as much
as poor kitti who at that veri moment wa cry in the next chamber
ye count said miladi in her softest voic and press hi hand
in her own i am happi in the love which your look and your word
have express to me everi time we have met i alsoi love you oh
tomorrow tomorrow i must have some pledg from you which will prove
that you think of me and that you mai not forget me take thi and
she slip a ring from her finger onto dartagnan dartagnan
rememb have seen thi ring on the finger of miladi it wa a
magnific sapphir encircl with brilliant
the first movement of dartagnan wa to return it but miladi ad
no no keep that ring for love of me besid in accept it she
ad in a voic full of emot you render me a much greater
servic than you imagin
thi woman is full of mysteri murmur dartagnan to himself at
that instant he felt himself readi to reveal all he even open hi
mouth to tell miladi who he wa and with what a reveng purpos he
had come but she ad poor angel whom that monster of a gascon
bare fail to kill
the monster wa himself
oh continu miladi do your wound still make you suffer
ye much said dartagnan who did not well know how to answer
be tranquil murmur miladi i will aveng youand cruelli
pest said dartagnan to himself the moment for confid ha
not yet come
it took some time for dartagnan to resum thi littl dialogu but
then all the idea of vengeanc which he had brought with him had
complet vanish thi woman exercis over him an unaccount
power he hate and ador her at the same time he would not have
believ that two sentiment so opposit could dwell in the same heart
and by their union constitut a passion so strang and as it were
diabol
present it sound on oclock it wa necessari to separ
dartagnan at the moment of quit miladi felt onli the liveliest
regret at the part and as thei address each other in a
reciproc passion adieu anoth interview wa arrang for the
follow week
poor kitti hope to speak a few word to dartagnan when he pass
through her chamber but miladi herself reconduct him through the
dark and onli quit him at the staircas
the next morn dartagnan ran to find atho he wa engag in an
adventur so singular that he wish for counsel he therefor told him
all
your miladi said he appear to be an infam creatur but not
the less you have done wrong to deceiv her in on fashion or anoth
you have a terribl enemi on your hand
while thu speak atho regard with attent the sapphir set with
diamond which had taken on dartagnan finger the place of the
queen ring carefulli kept in a casket

in the ey of hi friend
ye said atho it remind me of a famili jewel
it is beauti is it not said dartagnan
ye said atho magnific i did not think two sapphir of such
a fine water exist have you trade it for your diamond
no it is a gift from my beauti englishwoman or rather
frenchwomanfor i am convinc she wa born in franc though i have
not question her
that ring come from miladi cri atho with a voic in which it
wa easi to detect strong emot
her veri self she gave it me last night here it is repli
dartagnan take it from hi finger
atho examin it and becam veri pale he tri it on hi left hand
it fit hi finger as if made for it
a shade of anger and vengeanc pass across the usual calm brow of
thi gentleman
it is imposs it can be she said he how could thi ring come
into the hand of miladi clarik and yet it is difficult to suppos
such a resembl should exist between two jewel
do you know thi ring said dartagnan
i thought i did repli atho but no doubt i wa mistaken and he
return dartagnan the ring without howev ceas to look at it
prai dartagnan said atho after a minut either take off that
ring or turn the mount insid it recal such cruel recollect
that i shall have no head to convers with you dont ask me for
counsel dont tell me you ar perplex what to do but stop let me
look at that sapphir again the on i mention to you had on of it
face scratch by accid
dartagnan took off the ring give it again to atho
atho start look said he is it not strang and he point out
to dartagnan the scratch he had rememb
but from whom did thi ring come to you atho
from my mother who inherit it from her mother as i told you it is
an old famili jewel
and yousold it ask dartagnan hesitatingli
no repli atho with a singular smile i gave it awai in a night
of love as it ha been given to you
dartagnan becam pensiv in hi turn it appear as if there were
abyss in miladi soul whose depth were dark and unknown he took
back the ring but put it in hi pocket and not on hi finger
dartagnan said atho take hi hand you know i love you if i
had a son i could not love him better take my advic renounc thi
woman i do not know her but a sort of intuit tell me she is a
lost creatur and that there is someth fatal about her

press the gascon hand with an affect almost patern and god
grant that thi woman who ha scarc enter into your life mai not
leav a terribl trace in it and atho bow to dartagnan like a man
who wish it understood that he would not be sorri to be left alon
with hi thought

fever could not have chang her more than thi on night of
sleepless and sorrow

chapter xxxvii
miladi secret
dartagnan left the htel instead of go up at onc to kitti
chamber as she endeavor to persuad him to doand that for two
reason the first becaus by thi mean he should escap reproach
recrimin and prayer the second becaus he wa not sorri to
have an opportun of read hi own thought and endeavor if
possibl to fathom those of thi woman
what wa most clear in the matter wa that dartagnan love miladi like
a madman and that she did not love him at all in an instant
dartagnan perceiv that the best wai in which he could act would be
to go home and write miladi a long letter in which he would confess to
her that he and de ward were up to the present moment absolut the
same and that consequ he could not undertak without commit
suicid to kill the comt de ward but he also wa spur on by a
feroci desir of vengeanc he wish to subdu thi woman in hi
own name and as thi vengeanc appear to him to have a certain
sweet in it he could not make up hi mind to renounc it
he walk six or seven time round the place royal turn at everi
ten step to look at the light in miladi apart which wa to be
seen through the blind it wa evid that thi time the young woman
wa not in such hast to retir to her apart as she had been the
first
at length the light disappear with thi light wa extinguish the
last irresolut in the heart of dartagnan he recal to hi mind
the detail of the first night and with a beat heart and a brain on
fire he reenter the htel and flew toward kitti chamber
the poor girl pale as death and trembl in all her limb wish to
delai her lover but miladi with her ear on the watch had heard the
nois dartagnan had made and open the door said come in
all thi wa of such incred immodesti of such monstrou
effronteri that dartagnan could scarc believ what he saw or what
he heard he imagin himself to be drawn into on of those fantast
intrigu on meet in dream he howev dart not the less quickli
toward miladi yield to that magnet attract which the loadston
exercis over iron
as the door close after them kitti rush toward it jealousi furi
offend pride all the passion in short that disput the heart of an
outrag woman in love urg her to make a revel but she
reflect that she would be total lost if she confess have
assist in such a machin and abov all that dartagnan would
also be lost to her forev thi last thought of love counsel her to
make thi last sacrific
dartagnan on hi part had gain the summit of all hi wish it
wa no longer a rival who wa belov it wa himself who wa
appar belov a secret voic whisper to him at the bottom of
hi heart that he wa but an instrument of vengeanc that he wa onli
caress till he had given death but pride but selflov but mad
silenc thi voic and stifl it murmur and then our gascon with
that larg quantiti of conceit which we know he possess compar
himself with de ward and ask himself why after all he should not
be belov for himself
he wa absorb entir by the sensat of the moment miladi wa no
longer for him that woman of fatal intent who had for a moment
terrifi him she wa an ardent passion mistress abandon
herself to love which she also seem to feel two hour thu glide
awai when the transport of the two lover were calmer miladi who
had not the same motiv for forget that dartagnan had wa the
first to return to realiti and ask the young man if the mean which
were on the morrow to bring on the encount between him and de ward
were alreadi arrang in hi mind
but dartagnan whose idea had taken quit anoth cours forgot
himself like a fool and answer gallantli that it wa too late to
think about duel and sword thrust
thi cold toward the onli interest that occupi her mind
terrifi miladi whose question becam more press
then dartagnan who had never serious thought of thi imposs
duel endeavor to turn the convers but he could not succe
miladi kept him within the limit she had trace beforehand with her
irresist spirit and her iron will
dartagnan fanci himself veri cun when advis miladi to
renounc by pardon de ward the furiou project she had form
but at the first word the young woman start and exclaim in a
sharp banter tone which sound strang in the dark ar

what have i to fear
why that i mai be danger woundedkil even
imposs cri miladi you ar such a valiant man and such an
expert swordsman
you would not then prefer a method resum dartagnan which
would equal aveng you while render the combat useless
miladi look at her lover in silenc the pale light of the first rai
of dai gave to her clear ey a strang fright express
realli said she i believ you now begin to hesit
no i do not hesit but i realli piti thi poor comt de ward

the imprud young man expect a surpris mix with shamea slight
storm which would resolv itself into tear but he wa strang
deceiv and hi error wa not of long durat
pale and trembl miladi repuls dartagnan attempt embrac by a
violent blow on the chest as she sprang out of bed

a kiss dartagnan utter a slight cry of joi thi woman or rather
thi apparitionfor the carriag pass with the rapid of a
visionwa mme bonacieux
by an involuntari movement and in spite of the injunct given
dartagnan put hi hors into a gallop and in a few stride overtook
the carriag but the window wa hermet close the vision had
disappear
dartagnan then rememb the injunct if you valu your own life
or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had

he stop therefor trembl not for himself but for the poor woman
who had evid expos herself to great danger by appoint thi
rendezv
the carriag pursu it wai still go at a great pace till it
dash into pari and disappear
dartagnan remain fix to the spot astound and not know what
to think if it wa mme bonacieux and if she wa return to pari
why thi fugit rendezv why thi simpl exchang of a glanc why
thi lost kiss if on the other side it wa not shewhich wa still
quit possiblefor the littl light that remain render a mistak
easymight it not be the commenc of some plot against him through
the allur of thi woman for whom hi love wa known
hi three companion join him all had plainli seen a woman head
appear at the window but none of them except atho knew mme
bonacieux the opinion of atho wa that it wa inde she but less
preoccupi by that pretti face than dartagnan he had fanci he saw
a second head a man head insid the carriag
if that be the case said dartagnan thei ar doubtless
transport her from on prison to anoth but what can thei intend
to do with the poor creatur and how shall i ever meet her again
friend said atho grave rememb that it is the dead alon with
whom we ar not like to meet again on thi earth you know someth
of that as well as i do i think now if your mistress is not dead
if it is she we have just seen you will meet with her again some dai
or other and perhap my god ad he with that misanthrop tone
which wa peculiar to him perhap sooner than you wish
half past seven had sound the carriag had been twenti minut
behind the time appoint dartagnan friend remind him that he
had a visit to pai but at the same time bade him observ that there
wa yet time to retract
but dartagnan wa at the same time impetu and curiou he had made
up hi mind that he would go to the palaiscardin and that he would
learn what hi emin had to sai to him noth could turn him from
hi purpos
thei reach the rue st honor and in the place du palaiscardin
thei found the twelv invit musket walk about in expect
of their comrad there onli thei explain to them the matter in
hand
dartagnan wa well known among the honor corp of the king
musket in which it wa known he would on dai take hi place he
wa consid beforehand as a comrad it result from these
anteced that everyon enter heartili into the purpos for which
thei met besid it would not be unlik that thei would have an
opportun of plai either the cardin or hi peopl an ill turn
and for such expedit these worthi gentlemen were alwai readi
atho divid them into three group assum the command of on gave
the second to arami and the third to portho and then each group
went and took their watch near an entranc
dartagnan on hi part enter boldli at the princip gate
although he felt himself abli support the young man wa not without
a littl uneasi as he ascend the great staircas step by step
hi conduct toward miladi bore a strong resembl to treacheri and
he wa veri suspici of the polit relat which exist between
that woman and the cardin still further de ward whom he had
treat so ill wa on of the tool of hi emin and dartagnan
knew that while hi emin wa terribl to hi enemi he wa
strongli attach to hi friend
if de ward ha relat all our affair to the cardin which is not
to be doubt and if he ha recogn me as is probabl i mai
consid myself almost as a condemn man said dartagnan shake
hi head but why ha he wait till now that all plain enough
miladi ha laid her complaint against me with that hypocrit grief
which render her so interest and thi last offens ha made the
cup overflow
fortun ad he my good friend ar down yonder and thei
will not allow me to be carri awai without a struggl nevertheless
monsieur de trvill compani of musket alon cannot maintain a
war against the cardin who dispos of the forc of all franc and
befor whom the queen is without power and the king without will
dartagnan my friend you ar brave you ar prudent you have
excel qualiti but the women will ruin you
he came to thi melancholi conclus as he enter the antechamb he
place hi letter in the hand of the usher on duti who led him into
the wait room and pass on into the interior of the palac
in thi wait room were five or six of the cardin guard who
recogn dartagnan and know that it wa he who had wound
jussac thei look upon him with a smile of singular mean
thi smile appear to dartagnan to be of bad auguri onli as our
gascon wa not easili intimidatedor rather thank to a great pride
natur to the men of hi countri he did not allow on easili to see
what wa pass in hi mind when that which wa pass at all
resembl fearh place himself haughtili in front of messieur the
guard and wait with hi hand on hi hip in an attitud by no mean
defici in majesti
the usher return and made a sign to dartagnan to follow him it
appear to the young man that the guard on see him depart
chuckl among themselv
he travers a corridor cross a grand saloon enter a librari and
found himself in the presenc of a man seat at a desk and write
the usher introduc him and retir without speak a word
dartagnan remain stand and examin thi man
dartagnan at first believ that he had to do with some judg
examin hi paper but he perceiv that the man at the desk wrote
or rather correct line of unequ length scan the word on hi
finger he saw then that he wa with a poet at the end of an instant
the poet close hi manuscript upon the cover of which wa written
miram a tragedi in five act and rais hi head
dartagnan recogn the cardin

dartagnan descend by the staircas at which he had enter and
found atho and the four musket wait hi appear and

on thing afford him inward consol it wa expect by everybodi
that the campaign would be a sever on he whisper a hope to himself
that thi belov rel might be kill in the field
portho paid hi compliment to m coquenard and bade him farewel m

from her grief as she wa known to be veri much attach to her

other calvinist citi wa then the focu of dissens and
ambit moreov it port wa the last in the kingdom of franc open
to the english and by close it against england our etern enemi
the cardin complet the work of joan of arc and the duc de guis
thu bassompierr who wa at onc protest and catholicprotest
by convict and cathol as command of the order of the holi ghost
bassompierr who wa a german by birth and a frenchman at heartin
short bassompierr who had a distinguish command at the sieg of la
rochel said in charg at the head of sever other protest
nobl like himself you will see gentlemen that we shall be fool
enough to take la rochel
and bassompierr wa right the cannonad of the isl of r presag to
him the dragonnad of the cvenn the take of la rochel wa the
prefac to the revoc of the edict of nant
we have hint that by the side of these view of the level and
simplifi minist which belong to histori the chronicl is forc
to recogn the lesser motiv of the amor man and jealou rival
richelieu as everyon know had love the queen wa thi love a
simpl polit affair or wa it natur on of those profound
passion which ann of austria inspir in those who approach her
that we ar not abl to sai but at all event we have seen by the
anterior develop of thi stori that buckingham had the advantag
over him and in two or three circumst particularli that of the
diamond stud had thank to the devoted of the three musket
and the courag and conduct of dartagnan cruelli mystifi him
it wa then richelieu object not onli to get rid of an enemi of
franc but to aveng himself on a rival but thi vengeanc must be
grand and strike and worthi in everi wai of a man who held in hi
hand as hi weapon for combat the forc of a kingdom
richelieu knew that in combat england he combat buckingham that
in triumph over england he triumph over buckinghamin short that
in humili england in the ey of europ he humili buckingham
in the ey of the queen
on hi side buckingham in pretend to maintain the honor of england
wa move by interest exactli like those of the cardin buckingham
also wa pursu a privat vengeanc buckingham could not under ani
pretens be admit into franc as an ambassador he wish to enter
it as a conqueror
it result from thi that the real stake in thi game which two most
power kingdom plai for the good pleasur of two amor men wa
simpli a kind look from ann of austria
the first advantag had been gain by buckingham arriv
unexpectedli in sight of the isl of r with nineti vessel and nearli
twenti thousand men he had surpris the comt de toira who
command for the king in the isl and he had after a bloodi
conflict effect hi land
allow us to observ in pass that in thi fight perish the baron de
chantal that the baron de chantal left a littl orphan girl eighteen
month old and that thi littl girl wa afterward mme de svign
the comt de toira retir into the citadel st martin with hi
garrison and threw a hundr men into a littl fort call the fort of
la pre
thi event had hasten the resolut of the cardin and till the
king and he could take the command of the sieg of la rochel which
wa determin he had sent monsieur to direct the first oper
and had order all the troop he could dispos of to march toward the
theater of war it wa of thi detach sent as a vanguard that our
friend dartagnan form a part
the king as we have said wa to follow as soon as hi bed of justic
had been held but on rise from hi bed of justic on the
twentyeighth of june he felt himself attack by fever he wa
notwithstand anxiou to set out but hi ill becom more
seriou he wa forc to stop at villeroi
now whenev the king halt the musket halt it follow that
dartagnan who wa as yet pure and simpli in the guard found
himself for the time at least separ from hi good friendsatho
portho and arami thi separ which wa no more than an
unpleas circumst would have certainli becom a caus of seriou
uneasi if he had been abl to guess by what unknown danger he wa
surround
he howev arriv without accid in the camp establish befor la
rochel on the tenth of the month of septemb of the year 1627
everyth wa in the same state the duke of buckingham and hi
english master of the isl of r continu to besieg but without
success the citadel st martin and the fort of la pre and
hostil with la rochel had commenc two or three dai befor
about a fort which the duc dangoulm had caus to be construct
near the citi
the guard under the command of m dessessart took up their quarter
at the minim but as we know dartagnan possess with ambit to
enter the musket had form but few friendship among hi
comrad and he felt himself isol and given up to hi own
reflect
hi reflect were not veri cheer from the time of hi arriv in
pari he had been mix up with public affair but hi own privat
affair had made no great progress either in love or fortun as to
love the onli woman he could have love wa mme bonacieux and mme
bonacieux had disappear without hi be abl to discov what had
becom of her as to fortun he had madeh humbl as he wasan enemi
of the cardin that is to sai of a man befor whom trembl the
greatest men of the kingdom begin with the king
that man had the power to crush him and yet he had not done so for a
mind so perspicu as that of dartagnan thi indulg wa a light
by which he caught a glimps of a better futur
then he had made himself anoth enemi less to be fear he thought
but nevertheless he instinct felt not to be despis thi enemi
wa miladi
in exchang for all thi he had acquir the protect and good will
of the queen but the favor of the queen wa at the present time an
addit caus of persecut and her protect as it wa known
protect badlya wit chalai and mme bonacieux
what he had clearli gain in all thi wa the diamond worth five or
six thousand livr which he wore on hi finger and even thi
diamondsuppos that dartagnan in hi project of ambit wish
to keep it to make it somedai a pledg for the gratitud of the
queenhad not in the meanwhil sinc he could not part with it more
valu than the gravel he trod under hi feet
we sai the gravel he trod under hi feet for dartagnan made these
reflect while walk solitarili along a pretti littl road which
led from the camp to the villag of angoutin now these reflect
had led him further than he intend and the dai wa begin to
declin when by the last rai of the set sun he thought he saw the
barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedg
dartagnan had a quick ey and a prompt understand he comprehend
that the musket had not come there of itself and that he who bore it
had not conceal himself behind a hedg with ani friendli intent
he determin therefor to direct hi cours as clear from it as he
could when on the opposit side of the road from behind a rock he
perceiv the extrem of anoth musket
thi wa evid an ambuscad
the young man cast a glanc at the first musket and saw with a certain
degre of inquietud that it wa level in hi direct but as soon
as he perceiv that the orific of the barrel wa motionless he threw
himself upon the ground at the same instant the gun wa fire and he
heard the whistl of a ball pass over hi head
no time wa to be lost dartagnan sprang up with a bound and at the
same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the
veri spot on the road where he had thrown himself with hi face to the
ground
dartagnan wa not on of those foolhardi men who seek a ridicul
death in order that it mai be said of them that thei did not retreat a
singl step besid courag wa out of the question here dartagnan
had fallen into an ambush
if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man
he immedi therefor took to hi heel and ran toward the camp
with the swift of the young men of hi countri so renown for
their agil but whatev might be hi speed the first who fire
have had time to reload fire a second shot and thi time so well
aim that it struck hi hat and carri it ten pace from him
as he howev had no other hat he pick up thi as he ran and
arriv at hi quarter veri pale and quit out of breath he sat down
without sai a word to anybodi and began to reflect
thi event might have three caus
the first and the most natur wa that it might be an ambuscad of the
rochellai who might not be sorri to kill on of hi majesti guard
becaus it would be an enemi the less and thi enemi might have a
wellfurnish purs in hi pocket
dartagnan took hi hat examin the hole made by the ball and shook
hi head the ball wa not a musket ballit wa an arquebu ball the
accuraci of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon
had been emploi thi could not then be a militari ambuscad as
the ball wa not of the regular calib
thi might be a kind remembr of monsieur the cardin it mai be
observ that at the veri moment when thank to the rai of the sun he
perceiv the gun barrel he wa think with astonish on the
forbear of hi emin with respect to him
but dartagnan again shook hi head for peopl toward whom he had but
to put forth hi hand hi emin had rare recours to such mean
it might be a vengeanc of miladi that wa most probabl
he tri in vain to rememb the face or dress of the assassin he
had escap so rapidli that he had not had leisur to notic anyth
ah my poor friend murmur dartagnan where ar you and that
you should fail me
dartagnan pass a veri bad night three or four time he start up
imagin that a man wa approach hi bed for the purpos of
stab him nevertheless dai dawn without dark have brought
ani accid
but dartagnan well suspect that that which wa defer wa not
relinquish
dartagnan remain all dai in hi quarter assign as a reason to
himself that the weather wa bad
at nine oclock the next morn the drum beat to arm the duc
dorlan visit the post the guard were under arm and dartagnan
took hi place in the midst of hi comrad
monsieur pass along the front of the line then all the superior
offic approach him to pai their compliment m dessessart
captain of the guard as well as the other
at the expir of a minut or two it appear to dartagnan that m
dessessart made him a sign to approach he wait for a fresh gestur
on the part of hi superior for fear he might be mistaken but thi
gestur be repeat he left the rank and advanc to receiv
order
monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a danger
mission but on which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it
and i made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in
readi
thank my captain repli dartagnan who wish for noth better
than an opportun to distinguish himself under the ey of the
lieuten gener
in fact the rochellai had made a sorti dure the night and had
retaken a bastion of which the royal armi had gain possess two
dai befor the matter wa to ascertain by reconnoit how the
enemi guard thi bastion
at the end of a few minut monsieur rais hi voic and said i
want for thi mission three or four volunt led by a man who can be
depend upon
as to the man to be depend upon i have him under my hand
monsieur said m dessessart point to dartagnan and as to the
four or five volunt monsieur ha but to make hi intent known
and the men will not be want
four men of good will who will risk be kill with me said
dartagnan rais hi sword
two of hi comrad of the guard immedi sprang forward and two
other soldier have join them the number wa deem suffici
dartagnan declin all other be unwil to take the first
chanc from those who had the prioriti
it wa not known whether after the take of the bastion the
rochellai had evacu it or left a garrison in it the object then
wa to examin the place near enough to verifi the report
dartagnan set out with hi four companion and follow the trench
the two guard march abreast with him and the two soldier follow
behind
thei arriv thu screen by the line of the trench till thei came
within a hundr pace of the bastion there on turn round
dartagnan perceiv that the two soldier had disappear
he thought that begin to be afraid thei had stai behind and he
continu to advanc
at the turn of the counterscarp thei found themselv within about
sixti pace of the bastion thei saw no on and the bastion seem
abandon
the three compos our forlorn hope were deliber whether thei
should proce ani further when all at onc a circl of smoke
envelop the giant of stone and a dozen ball came whistl around
dartagnan and hi companion
thei knew all thei wish to know the bastion wa guard a longer
stai in thi danger spot would have been useless imprud
dartagnan and hi two companion turn their back and commenc a
retreat which resembl a flight
on arriv at the angl of the trench which wa to serv them as a
rampart on of the guardsmen fell a ball had pass through hi
breast the other who wa safe and sound continu hi wai toward the
camp
dartagnan wa not will to abandon hi companion thu and stoop
to rais him and assist him in regain the line but at thi moment
two shot were fire on ball struck the head of the alreadywound
guard and the other flatten itself against a rock after have
pass within two inch of dartagnan
the young man turn quickli round for thi attack could not have come
from the bastion which wa hidden by the angl of the trench the idea
of the two soldier who had abandon him occur to hi mind and
with them he rememb the assassin of two even befor he
resolv thi time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the
bodi of hi comrad as if he were dead
he quickli saw two head appear abov an abandon work within thirti
pace of him thei were the head of the two soldier dartagnan had
not been deceiv these two men had onli follow for the purpos of
assassin him hope that the young man death would be place to
the account of the enemi
as he might be onli wound and might denounc their crime thei came
up to him with the purpos of make sure fortun deceiv by
dartagnan trick thei neglect to reload their gun
when thei were within ten pace of him dartagnan who in fall had
taken care not to let go hi sword sprang up close to them
the assassin comprehend that if thei fled toward the camp without
have kill their man thei should be accus by him therefor their
first idea wa to join the enemi on of them took hi gun by the
barrel and us it as he would a club he aim a terribl blow at
dartagnan who avoid it by spring to on side but by thi
movement he left a passag free to the bandit who dart off toward
the bastion as the rochellai who guard the bastion were ignor of
the intent of the man thei saw come toward them thei fire upon
him and he fell struck by a ball which broke hi shoulder
meantim dartagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier
attack him with hi sword the conflict wa not long the wretch had
noth to defend himself with but hi discharg arquebu the sword
of the guardsman slip along the barrel of the nowuseless weapon
and pass through the thigh of the assassin who fell
dartagnan immedi place the point of hi sword at hi throat
oh do not kill me cri the bandit pardon pardon my offic
and i will tell you all
is your secret of enough import to me to spare your life for it
ask the young man withhold hi arm
ye if you think exist worth anyth to a man of twenti as you

wretch cri dartagnan speak quickli who emploi you to
assassin me

pocket
but cri the bandit that is onli anoth wai of kill me how

you must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or i swear

to lose hi strength with hi blood
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i
believ that woman dead ask dartagnan
by that letter which my comrad ha in hi pocket
you see then said dartagnan that i must have that letter so no
more delai no more hesit or els whatev mai be my repugn
to soil my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you
i swear by my faith as an honest man and at these word dartagnan
made so fierc a gestur that the wound man sprang up
stop stop cri he regain strength by forc of terror i will
goi will go
dartagnan took the soldier arquebu made him go on befor him and
urg him toward hi companion by prick him behind with hi sword
it wa a fright thing to see thi wretch leav a long track of
blood on the ground he pass over pale with approach death try
to drag himself along without be seen to the bodi of hi accomplic
which lai twenti pace from him
terror wa so strongli paint on hi face cover with a cold sweat
that dartagnan took piti on him and cast upon him a look of
contempt stop said he i will show you the differ between a
man of courag and such a coward as you stai where you ar i will go
myself
and with a light step an ey on the watch observ the movement of
the enemi and take advantag of the accid of the ground
dartagnan succeed in reach the second soldier
there were two mean of gain hi objectto search him on the spot
or to carri him awai make a buckler of hi bodi and search him in
the trench
dartagnan prefer the second mean and lift the assassin onto hi
shoulder at the moment the enemi fire
a slight shock the dull nois of three ball which penetr the
flesh a last cry a convuls of agoni prove to dartagnan that the
wouldb assassin had save hi life
dartagnan regain the trench and threw the corps besid the wound
man who wa as pale as death
then he began to search a leather pocketbook a purs in which wa
evid a part of the sum which the bandit had receiv with a dice
box and dice complet the possess of the dead man
he left the box and dice where thei fell threw the purs to the
wound man and eagerli open the pocketbook
among some unimport paper he found the follow letter that which
he had sought at the risk of hi life

had miss the carriag by ten minut
but what were you to do with that woman ask dartagnan with
anguish
we were to have convei her to a htel in the place royal said the
wound man

then the young man tremblingli comprehend what a terribl thirst for
vengeanc urg thi woman on to destroi him as well as all who love
him and how well she must be acquaint with the affair of the court
sinc she had discov all there could be no doubt she ow thi
inform to the cardin
but amid all thi he perceiv with a feel of real joi that the
queen must have discov the prison in which poor mme bonacieux wa
explain her devot and that she had freed her from that prison
and the letter he had receiv from the young woman and her passag
along the road of chaillot like an apparit were now explain

the sign of the red dovecot
meanwhil the king who with more reason than the cardin show hi
hatr for buckingham although scarc arriv wa in such a hast to
meet the enemi that he command everi disposit to be made to drive
the english from the isl of r and afterward to press the sieg of la
rochel but notwithstand hi earnest wish he wa delai by the
dissens which broke out between mm bassompierr and schomberg
against the duc dangoulm
mm bassompierr and schomberg were marshal of franc and claim
their right of command the armi under the order of the king but
the cardin who fear that bassompierr a huguenot at heart might
press but feebli the english and rochellai hi brother in religion
support the duc dangoulm whom the king at hi instig had
name lieuten gener the result wa that to prevent mm
bassompierr and schomberg from desert the armi a separ command
had to be given to each bassompierr took up hi quarter on the north
of the citi between leu and dompierr the duc dangoulm on the
east from dompierr to perigni and m de schomberg on the south from
perigni to angoutin
the quarter of monsieur were at dompierr the quarter of the king
were sometim at estr sometim at jarri the cardin quarter
were upon the down at the bridg of la pierr in a simpl hous
without ani entrench so that monsieur watch bassompierr the
king the duc dangoulm and the cardin m de schomberg
as soon as thi organ wa establish thei set about drive
the english from the isl
the junctur wa favor the english who requir abov everyth
good live in order to be good soldier onli eat salt meat and bad
biscuit had mani invalid in their camp still further the sea veri
rough at thi period of the year all along the sea coast destroi
everi dai some littl vessel and the shore from the point of
laiguillon to the trench wa at everi tide liter cover with
the wreck of pinnacl roberg and felucca the result wa that
even if the king troop remain quietli in their camp it wa
evid that some dai or other buckingham who onli continu in the
isl from obstinaci would be oblig to rais the sieg
but as m de toira gave inform that everyth wa prepar in
the enemi camp for a fresh assault the king judg that it would be
best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessari order for a
decis action
as it is not our intent to give a journal of the sieg but on the
contrari onli to describ such of the event of it as ar connect
with the stori we ar relat we will content ourselv with sai
in two word that the expedit succeed to the great astonish
of the king and the great glori of the cardin the english repuls
foot by foot beaten in all encount and defeat in the passag of
the isl of loie were oblig to reembark leav on the field of
battl two thousand men among whom were five colonel three
lieuten colonel two hundr and fifti captain twenti gentlemen
of rank four piec of cannon and sixti flag which were taken to
pari by claud de st simon and suspend with great pomp in the
arch of notr dame
te deum were chant in camp and afterward throughout franc
the cardin wa left free to carri on the sieg without have at
least at the present anyth to fear on the part of the english
but it must be acknowledg thi respons wa but momentari an envoi
of the duke of buckingham name montagu wa taken and proof wa
obtain of a leagu between the german empir spain england and
lorrain thi leagu wa direct against franc
still further in buckingham lodg which he had been forc to
abandon more precipit than he expect paper were found which
confirm thi allianc and which as the cardin assert in hi
memoir strongli compromis mme de chevreus and consequ the
queen
it wa upon the cardin that all the respons fell for on is
not a despot minist without respons all therefor of the
vast resourc of hi geniu were at work night and dai engag in
listen to the least report heard in ani of the great kingdom of
europ
the cardin wa acquaint with the activ and more particularli
the hatr of buckingham if the leagu which threaten franc
triumph all hi influenc would be lost spanish polici and austrian
polici would have their repres in the cabinet of the louvr
where thei had as yet but partisan and he richelieuth french
minist the nation ministerwould be ruin the king even while
obei him like a child hate him as a child hate hi master and
would abandon him to the person vengeanc of monsieur and the queen
he would then be lost and franc perhap with him all thi must be
prepar against
courtier becom everi instant more numer succeed on anoth
dai and night in the littl hous of the bridg of la pierr in which
the cardin had establish hi resid
there were monk who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it wa
easi to perceiv thei belong to the church milit women a littl
inconvenienc by their costum as page and whose larg trouser could
not entir conceal their round form and peasant with blacken
hand but with fine limb savor of the man of qualiti a leagu off
there were also less agreeabl visitsfor two or three time report
were spread that the cardin had nearli been assassin
it is true that the enemi of the cardin said that it wa he himself
who set these bungl assassin to work in order to have if want
the right of us repris but we must not believ everyth
minist sai nor everyth their enemi sai
these attempt did not prevent the cardin to whom hi most
inveter detractor have never deni person braveri from make
nocturn excurs sometim to commun to the duc dangoulm
import order sometim to confer with the king and sometim to
have an interview with a messeng whom he did not wish to see at home
on their part the musket who had not much to do with the sieg
were not under veri strict order and led a joyou life thi wa the
more easi for our three companion in particular for be friend of

to charg me and as i desir to continu to merit the confid of
your emin deign to unfold it to me in term clear and precis
that i mai not commit an error
there wa an instant of profound silenc between the two interlocutor
it wa evid that the cardin wa weigh beforehand the term in
which he wa about to speak and that miladi wa collect all her
intellectu faculti to comprehend the thing he wa about to sai
and to engrav them in her memori when thei should be spoken
atho took advantag of thi moment to tell hi two companion to
fasten the door insid and to make them a sign to come and listen with
him
the two musket who love their eas brought a chair for each of
themselv and on for atho all three then sat down with their head
togeth and their ear on the alert
you will go to london continu the cardin arriv in london
you will seek buckingham
i must beg your emin to observ said miladi that sinc the
affair of the diamond stud about which the duke alwai suspect me
hi grace distrust me
well thi time said the cardin it is not necessari to steal hi
confid but to present yourself frankli and loyal as a
negoti
frankli and loyal repeat miladi with an unspeak express
of duplic
ye frankli and loyal repli the cardin in the same tone
all thi negoti must be carri on openli
i will follow your emin instruct to the letter i onli wait
till you give them
you will go to buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him i am
acquaint with all the prepar he ha made but that thei give me
no uneasi sinc at the first step he take i will ruin the queen
will he believ that your emin is in a posit to accomplish the
threat thu made
ye for i have the proof
i must be abl to present these proof for hi appreci
without doubt and you will tell him i will publish the report of
boisrobert and the marqui de beautru upon the interview which the
duke had at the resid of madam the constabl with the queen on the
even madam the constabl gave a masquerad you will tell him in
order that he mai not doubt that he came there in the costum of the
great mogul which the chevali de guis wa to have worn and that he
purchas thi exchang for the sum of three thousand pistol
well monseigneur
all the detail of hi come into and go out of the palaceon the
night when he introduc himself in the charact of an italian fortun
tellery will tell him that he mai not doubt the correct of my
inform that he had under hi cloak a larg white robe dot with
black tear death head and crossbonesfor in case of a surpris
he wa to pass for the phantom of the white ladi who as all the world
know appear at the louvr everi time ani great event is impend
is that all monseigneur
tell him also that i am acquaint with all the detail of the
adventur at amien that i will have a littl romanc made of it
wittili turn with a plan of the garden and portrait of the
princip actor in that nocturn romanc
i will tell him that
tell him further that i hold montagu in my power that montagu is in
the bastil that no letter were found upon him it is true but that
tortur mai make him tell much of what he know and even what he doe
not know
exactli
then add that hi grace ha in the precipit with which he quit
the isl of r forgotten and left behind him in hi lodg a certain
letter from madam de chevreus which singularli compromis the queen
inasmuch as it prove not onli that her majesti can love the enemi of
the king but that she can conspir with the enemi of franc you
recollect perfectli all i have told you do you not
your emin will judg the ball of madam the constabl the night
at the louvr the even at amien the arrest of montagu the
letter of madam de chevreus
that it said the cardin that it you have an excel
memori miladi
but resum she to whom the cardin address thi flatter
compliment if in spite of all these reason the duke doe not give
wai and continu to menac franc
the duke is in love to mad or rather to folli repli
richelieu with great bitter like the ancient paladin he ha
onli undertaken thi war to obtain a look from hi ladi love if he
becom certain that thi war will cost the honor and perhap the
liberti of the ladi of hi thought as he sai i will answer for it
he will look twice
and yet said miladi with a persist that prove she wish to
see clearli to the end of the mission with which she wa about to be
charg if he persist
if he persist said the cardin that is not probabl
it is possibl said miladi
if he persist hi emin made a paus and resum if he
persistswel then i shall hope for on of those event which chang
the destini of state
if your emin would quot to me some on of these event in
histori said miladi perhap i should partak of your confid as
to the futur
well here for exampl said richelieu when in 1610 for a caus
similar to that which move the duke king henri iv of gloriou
memori wa about at the same time to invad flander and itali in
order to attack austria on both side well did there not happen an
event which save austria why should not the king of franc have the
same chanc as the emperor
your emin mean i presum the knife stab in the rue de la
feronneri
precis said the cardin
doe not your emin fear that the punish inflict upon
ravaillac mai deter anyon who might entertain the idea of imit
him
there will be in all time and in all countri particularli if
religi divis exist in those countri fanat who ask noth
better than to becom martyr ay and observeit just occur to me
that the puritan ar furiou against buckingham and their preacher
design him as the antichrist
well said miladi
well continu the cardin in an indiffer tone the onli thing
to be sought for at thi moment is some woman handsom young and
clever who ha caus of quarrel with the duke the duke ha had mani
affair of gallantri and if he ha foster hi amour by promis of
etern constanc he must likewis have sown the seed of hatr by
hi etern infidel
no doubt said miladi coolli such a woman mai be found
well such a woman who would place the knife of jacqu clment or of
ravaillac in the hand of a fanat would save franc
ye but she would then be the accomplic of an assassin
were the accomplic of ravaillac or of jacqu clment ever known
no for perhap thei were too highplac for anyon to dare look for
them where thei were the palac of justic would not be burn down
for everybodi monseigneur
you think then that the fire at the palac of justic wa not caus
by chanc ask richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a
question of no import
i monseigneur repli miladi i think noth i quot a fact
that is all onli i sai that if i were name madam de montpensi or
the queen mari de mdici i should us less precaut than i take
be simpli call miladi clarik
that is just said richelieu what do you requir then
i requir an order which would ratifi beforehand all that i should
think proper to do for the greatest good of franc
but in the first place thi woman i have describ must be found who
is desir of aveng herself upon the duke
she is found said miladi
then the miser fanat must be found who will serv as an
instrument of god justic
he will be found
well said the cardin then it will be time to claim the order
which you just now requir
your emin is right repli miladi and i have been wrong in
see in the mission with which you honor me anyth but that which
it realli isthat is to announc to hi grace on the part of your
emin that you ar acquaint with the differ disguis by mean
of which he succeed in approach the queen dure the fte given by
madam the constabl that you have proof of the interview grant at
the louvr by the queen to a certain italian astrolog who wa no
other than the duke of buckingham that you have order a littl
romanc of a satir natur to be written upon the adventur of
amien with a plan of the garden in which those adventur took
place and portrait of the actor who figur in them that montagu
is in the bastil and that the tortur mai make him sai thing he
rememb and even thing he ha forgotten that you possess a certain
letter from madam de chevreus found in hi grace lodg which
singularli compromis not onli her who wrote it but her in whose name
it wa written then if he persist notwithstand all thisa that
is as i have said the limit of my missioni shall have noth to do
but to prai god to work a miracl for the salvat of franc that is
it is it not monseigneur and i shall have noth els to do
that is it repli the cardin dryli
and now said miladi without appear to remark the chang of the
duke tone toward hernow that i have receiv the instruct of
your emin as concern your enemi monseigneur will permit me to
sai a few word to him of mine
have you enemi then ask richelieu
ye monseigneur enemi against whom you ow me all your support
for i made them by serv your emin

in the first place there is a littl intrigant name bonacieux

that is to sai she wa there repli miladi but the queen ha
obtain an order from the king by mean of which she ha been convei
to a convent
to a convent said the duke
ye to a convent
and to which
i dont know the secret ha been well kept
but i will know
and your emin will tell me in what convent that woman is

well now i have an enemi much more to be dread by me than thi
littl madam bonacieux
who is that
her lover
what is hi name

anger he is the evil geniu of both of us it is he who in an
encount with your emin guard decid the victori in favor of

ward your emissari and who caus the affair of the diamond stud
to fail it is he who know it wa i who had madam bonacieux
carri off ha sworn my death
ah ah said the cardin i know of whom you speak
i mean that miser dartagnan
he is a bold fellow said the cardin
and it is exactli becaus he is a bold fellow that he is the more to
be fear
i must have said the duke a proof of hi connect with
buckingham
a proof cri miladi i will have ten
well then it becom the simplest thing in the world get me that
proof and i will send him to the bastil
so far good monseigneur but afterward
when onc in the bastil there is no afterward said the cardin
in a low voic ah pardieu continu he if it were as easi for
me to get rid of my enemi as it is easi to get rid of your and if it
were against such peopl you requir impun
monseigneur repli miladi a fair exchang life for life man for
man give me on i will give you the other

infam a creatureth more so as you tell me thi dartagnan is a
libertin a duelist and a traitor

here thei ar monseigneur
there wa a moment of silenc which prove that the cardin wa
emploi in seek the term in which he should write the note or
els in write it atho who had not lost a word of the convers
took hi two companion by the hand and led them to the other end of
the room
well said portho what do you want and why do you not let us
listen to the end of the convers
hush said atho speak in a low voic we have heard all it wa

inn dragoon swiss guardsmen musket lighthorsemen succeed

ah ye said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandi in hi hand
which he sip slowli i hear you gentlemen of the guard have been

even have as you mai have heard introduc a barrel of powder under
on of the angl which in blow up made a veri pretti breach
without reckon that as the bastion wa not built yesterdai all the
rest of the build wa badli shaken
and what bastion is it ask a dragoon with hi saber run through a
goos which he wa take to be cook
the bastion st gervai repli dartagnan from behind which the
rochellai annoi our workmen
wa that affair hot
ye moder so we lost five men and the rochellai eight or
ten
balzempleu said the swiss who notwithstand the admir
collect of oath possess by the german languag had acquir a
habit of swear in french
but it is probabl said the lighthorseman that thei will send
pioneer thi morn to repair the bastion
ye that probabl said dartagnan
gentlemen said atho a wager

companion messieur portho arami and dartagnan and myself will
go and breakfast in the bastion st gervai and we will remain there
an hour by the watch whatev the enemi mai do to dislodg us
portho and arami look at each other thei began to comprehend
but said dartagnan in the ear of atho you ar go to get us
all kill without merci
we ar much more like to be kill said atho if we do not go
my faith gentlemen said portho turn round upon hi chair and
twist hi mustach that a fair bet i hope
i take it said m de busigni so let us fix the stake
you ar four gentlemen said atho and we ar four an unlimit
dinner for eight will that do
capit repli m de busigni
perfectli said the dragoon
that shoot me said the swiss
the fourth auditor who dure all thi convers had plai a mute
part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesc in the
proposit
the breakfast for these gentlemen is readi said the host
well bring it said atho
the host obei atho call grimaud point to a larg basket which
lai in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viand up in the
napkin
grimaud understood that it wa to be a breakfast on the grass took the
basket pack up the viand ad the bottl and then took the
basket on hi arm
but where ar you go to eat my breakfast ask the host
what matter if you ar paid for it said atho and he threw two
pistol majest on the tabl
shall i give you the chang my offic said the host
no onli add two bottl of champagn and the differ will be for
the napkin
the host had not quit so good a bargain as he at first hope for but
he made amend by slip in two bottl of anjou wine instead of two
bottl of champagn
monsieur de busigni said atho will you be so kind as to set your
watch with mine or permit me to regul mine by your
which you pleas monsieur said the lighthorseman draw from hi
fob a veri handsom watch stud with diamond half past seven
thirtyf minut after seven said atho by which you perceiv i
am five minut faster than you
and bow to all the astonish person present the young men took
the road to the bastion st gervai follow by grimaud who carri
the basket ignor of where he wa go but in the passiv obedi
which atho had taught him not even think of ask
as long as thei were within the circl of the camp the four friend
did not exchang on word besid thei were follow by the curiou
who hear of the wager were anxiou to know how thei would come out
of it but when onc thei pass the line of circumval and found
themselv in the open plain dartagnan who wa complet ignor
of what wa go forward thought it wa time to demand an
explan
and now my dear atho said he do me the kind to tell me where
we ar go
why you see plainli enough we ar go to the bastion
but what ar we go to do there
you know well that we go to breakfast there
but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot
becaus we have veri import matter to commun to on anoth
and it wa imposs to talk five minut in that inn without be
annoi by all those importun fellow who keep come in salut
you and address you here at least said atho point to the
bastion thei will not come and disturb us
it appear to me said dartagnan with that prudenc which alli
itself in him so natur with excess braveri that we could have
found some retir place on the down or the seashor
where we should have been seen all four confer togeth so that
at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardin would have been
inform by hi spi that we were hold a council
ye said arami atho is right animadvertuntur in deserti
a desert would not have been amiss said portho but it behoov us
to find it
there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over on head where a
fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of
it burrow and i believ that bird fish and rabbit each becom a
spy of the cardin better then pursu our enterpris from which
besid we cannot retreat without shame we have made a wagera wager
which could not have been foreseen and of which i defi anyon to
divin the true caus we ar go in order to win it to remain an
hour in the bastion either we shall be attack or not if we ar
not we shall have all the time to talk and nobodi will hear usfor i
guarante the wall of the bastion have no ear if we ar we will
talk of our affair just the same moreov in defend ourselv we
shall cover ourselv with glori you see that everyth is to our
advantag
ye said dartagnan but we shall indubit attract a ball
well my dear repli atho you know well that the ball most to
be dread ar not from the enemi
but for such an expedit we sure ought to have brought our
musket

useless burden

useless in the face of an enemi

frenchmen were kill and as mani rochellai

and atho threw fifteen pace from him an empti bottl from which he
had pour the last drop into hi glass
a moment said dartagnan i will not abandon buckingham thu he
gave us some veri fine hors
and moreov veri handsom saddl said portho who at the moment
wore on hi cloak the lace of hi own
besid said arami god desir the convers and not the death
of a sinner
amen said atho and we will return to that subject later if such
be your pleasur but what for the moment engag my attent most
earnestli and i am sure you will understand me dartagnan wa the
get from thi woman a kind of cart blanch which she had
extort from the cardin and by mean of which she could with
impun get rid of you and perhap of us
but thi creatur must be a demon said portho hold out hi
plate to arami who wa cut up a fowl
and thi cart blanch said dartagnan thi cart blanch
doe it remain in her hand
no it pass into mine i will not sai without troubl for if i did
i should tell a lie
my dear atho i shall no longer count the number of time i am
indebt to you for my life
then it wa to go to her that you left us said arami
exactli
and you have that letter of the cardin said dartagnan
here it is said atho and he took the invalu paper from the
pocket of hi uniform dartagnan unfold it with on hand whose
trembl he did not even attempt to conceal to read
dec 3 1627
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of
thi ha done what he ha done
richelieu
in fact said arami it is an absolut accord to rule
that paper must be torn to piec said dartagnan who fanci he
read in it hi sentenc of death
on the contrari said atho it must be preserv carefulli i would
not give up thi paper if cover with as mani gold piec
and what will she do now ask the young man
why repli atho carelessli she is probabl go to write to
the cardin that a damn musket name atho ha taken her
safeconduct from her by forc she will advis him in the same letter
to get rid of hi two friend arami and portho at the same time
the cardin will rememb that these ar the same men who have often
cross hi path and then some fine morn he will arrest dartagnan
and for fear he should feel lone he will send us to keep him compani
in the bastil
go to it appear to me you make dull joke my dear said portho
i do not jest said atho
do you know said portho that to twist that damn miladi neck
would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devil of
huguenot who have commit no other crime than sing in french the
psalm we sing in latin
what sai the abb ask atho quietli
i sai i am entir of porthoss opinion repli arami
and i too said dartagnan
fortun she is far off said portho for i confess she would
worri me if she were here
she worri me in england as well as in franc said atho
she worri me everywher said dartagnan
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her
strangl her hang her said portho it is onli the dead who do not
return
you think so portho repli the musket with a sad smile which
dartagnan alon understood
i have an idea said dartagnan
what is it said the musket
to arm cri grimaud
the young men sprang up and seiz their musket
thi time a small troop advanc consist of from twenti to
twentyf men but thei were not pioneer thei were soldier of the
garrison
shall we return to the camp said portho i dont think the side
ar equal
imposs for three reason repli atho the first that we
have not finish breakfast the second that we still have some veri
import thing to sai and the third that it yet want ten minut
befor the laps of the hour
well then said arami we must form a plan of battl
that veri simpl repli atho as soon as the enemi ar within
musket shot we must fire upon them if thei continu to advanc we
must fire again we must fire as long as we have load gun if those
who remain of the troop persist in come to the assault we will allow
the besieg to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down
upon their head that strip of wall which keep it perpendicular by a
miracl
bravo cri portho decidedli atho you were born to be a
gener and the cardin who fanci himself a great soldier is
noth besid you
gentlemen said atho no divid attent i beg let each on
pick out hi man
i cover mine said dartagnan
and i mine said portho
and i idem said arami
fire then said atho
the four musket made but on report but four men fell
the drum immedi beat and the littl troop advanc at charg
pace
then the shot were repeat without regular but alwai aim with
the same accuraci nevertheless as if thei had been awar of the
numer weak of the friend the rochellai continu to advanc
in quick time
with everi three shot at least two men fell but the march of those
who remain wa not slacken
arriv at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen
of the enemi a last discharg welcom them but did not stop them
thei jump into the ditch and prepar to scale the breach
now my friend said atho finish them at a blow to the wall to
the wall
and the four friend second by grimaud push with the barrel of
their musket an enorm sheet of the wall which bent as if push by
the wind and detach itself from it base fell with a horribl
crash into the ditch then a fear crash wa heard a cloud of dust
mount toward the skyand all wa over
can we have destroi them all from the first to the last said
atho
my faith it appear so said dartagnan
no cri portho there go three or four limp awai
in fact three or four of these unfortun men cover with dirt and
blood fled along the hollow wai and at length regain the citi
these were all who were left of the littl troop
atho look at hi watch
gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won
but we will be fair player besid dartagnan ha not told us hi
idea yet
and the musket with hi usual cool reseat himself befor the
remain of the breakfast
my idea said dartagnan
ye you said you had an idea said atho
oh i rememb said dartagnan well i will go to england a second
time i will go and find buckingham
you shall not do that dartagnan said atho coolli
and why not have i not been there onc
ye but at that period we were not at war at that period buckingham
wa an alli and not an enemi what you would now do amount to
treason
dartagnan perceiv the forc of thi reason and wa silent
but said portho i think i have an idea in my turn
silenc for monsieur porthoss idea said arami
i will ask leav of absenc of monsieur de trvill on some pretext
or other which you must invent i am not veri clever at pretext
miladi doe not know me i will get access to her without her
suspect me and when i catch my beauti i will strangl her
well repli atho i am not far from approv the idea of
monsieur portho
for shame said arami kill a woman no listen to me i have the
true idea
let us see your idea arami said atho who felt much defer for
the young musket
we must inform the queen
ah my faith ye said portho and dartagnan at the same time we
ar come nearer to it now
inform the queen said atho and how have we relat with the
court could we send anyon to pari without it be known in the
camp from here to pari it is a hundr and forti leagu befor our
letter wa at anger we should be in a dungeon
as to remit a letter with safeti to her majesti said arami
color i will take that upon myself i know a clever person at
tour
arami stop on see atho smile
well do you not adopt thi mean atho said dartagnan
i do not reject it altogeth said atho but i wish to remind
arami that he cannot quit the camp and that nobodi but on of
ourselv is trustworthi that two hour after the messeng ha set
out all the capuchin all the polic all the black cap of the
cardin will know your letter by heart and you and your clever
person will be arrest
without reckon object portho that the queen would save
monsieur de buckingham but would take no heed of us
gentlemen said dartagnan what portho sai is full of sens
ah ah but what go on in the citi yonder said atho
thei ar beat the gener alarm
the four friend listen and the sound of the drum plainli reach
them
you see thei ar go to send a whole regiment against us said
atho
you dont think of hold out against a whole regiment do you said
portho
why not said the musket i feel myself quit in a humor for it
and i would hold out befor an armi if we had taken the precaut to
bring a dozen more bottl of wine
upon my word the drum draw near said dartagnan
let it come said atho it is a quarter of an hour journei from
here to the citi consequ a quarter of an hour journei from the
citi to hither that is more than time enough for us to devis a plan
if we go from thi place we shall never find anoth so suitabl ah
stop i have it gentlemen the right idea ha just occur to me
tell us
allow me to give grimaud some indispens order
atho made a sign for hi lackei to approach
grimaud said atho point to the bodi which lai under the wall
of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall
put their hat upon their head and their gun in their hand
oh the great man cri dartagnan i comprehend now
you comprehend said portho
and do you comprehend grimaud said arami
grimaud made a sign in the affirm
that all that is necessari said atho now for my idea
i should like howev to comprehend said portho
that is useless
ye ye athoss idea cri arami and dartagnan at the same
time
thi miladi thi woman thi creatur thi demon ha a
brotherinlaw as i think you told me dartagnan
ye i know him veri well and i also believ that he ha not a veri
warm affect for hi sisterinlaw
there is no harm in that if he detest her it would be all the
better repli atho
in that case we ar as well off as we wish
and yet said portho i would like to know what grimaud is about
silenc portho said arami
what is her brotherinlaw name
lord de winter
where is he now
he return to london at the first sound of war
well there just the man we want said atho it is he whom we
must warn we will have him inform that hi sisterinlaw is on the
point of have someon assassin and beg him not to lose sight of
her there is in london i hope some establish like that of the
magdalen or of the repent daughter he must place hi sister in
on of these and we shall be in peac
ye said dartagnan till she come out
ah my faith said atho you requir too much dartagnan i have
given you all i have and i beg leav to tell you that thi is the
bottom of my sack
but i think it would be still better said arami to inform the
queen and lord de winter at the same time
ye but who is to carri the letter to tour and who to london
i answer for bazin said arami
and i for planchet said dartagnan
ay said portho if we cannot leav the camp our lackei mai
to be sure thei mai and thi veri dai we will write the letter
said arami give the lackei monei and thei will start
we will give them monei repli atho have you ani monei
the four friend look at on anoth and a cloud came over the brow
which but late had been so cheer
look out cri dartagnan i see black point and red point move
yonder why did you talk of a regiment atho it is a verit armi
my faith ye said atho there thei ar see the sneak come
without drum or trumpet ah ah have you finish grimaud
grimaud made a sign in the affirm and point to a dozen bodi
which he had set up in the most picturesqu attitud some carri
arm other seem to be take aim and the remaind appear mere
to be sword in hand
bravo said atho that doe honor to your imagin
all veri well said portho but i should like to understand
let us decamp first and you will understand afterward
a moment gentlemen a moment give grimaud time to clear awai the
breakfast
ah ah said arami the black point and the red point ar visibl
enlarg i am of dartagnan opinion we have no time to lose in
regain our camp
my faith said atho i have noth to sai against a retreat we
bet upon on hour and we have stai an hour and a half noth can
be said let us be off gentlemen let us be off
grimaud wa alreadi ahead with the basket and the dessert the four
friend follow ten pace behind him
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen cri atho
have you forgotten anyth said arami
the white flag morbleu we must not leav a flag in the hand of
the enemi even if that flag be but a napkin
and atho ran back to the bastion mount the platform and bore off
the flag but as the rochellai had arriv within musket rang thei
open a terribl fire upon thi man who appear to expos himself
for pleasur sake
but atho might be said to bear a charm life the ball pass and
whistl all around him not on struck him
atho wave hi flag turn hi back on the guard of the citi and
salut those of the camp on both side loud cri aroseon the on
side cri of anger on the other cri of enthusiasm
a second discharg follow the first and three ball by pass
through it made the napkin realli a flag cri were heard from the
camp come down come down
atho came down hi friend who anxious await him saw him
return with joi
come along atho come along cri dartagnan now we have found
everyth except monei it would be stupid to be kill
but atho continu to march majest whatev remark hi
companion made and thei find their remark useless regul
their pace by hi
grimaud and hi basket were far in advanc out of the rang of the
ball
at the end of an instant thei heard a furiou fusillad
what that ask portho what ar thei fire at now i hear no
ball whistl and i see nobodi
thei ar fire at the corps repli atho
but the dead cannot return their fire
certainli not thei will then fanci it is an ambuscad thei will
deliber and by the time thei have found out the pleasantri we
shall be out of the rang of their ball that render it useless to
get a pleurisi by too much hast
oh i comprehend now said the astonish portho
that lucki said atho shrug hi shoulder
on their part the french on see the four friend return at such a
step utter cri of enthusiasm
at length a fresh discharg wa heard and thi time the ball came
rattl among the stone around the four friend and whistl
sharpli in their ear the rochellai had at last taken possess of
the bastion
these rochellai ar bungl fellow said atho how mani have we
kill of thema dozen
or fifteen
how mani did we crush under the wall
eight or ten
and in exchang for all that not even a scratch ah but what is the
matter with your hand dartagnan it bleed seemingli
oh it noth said dartagnan
a spent ball
not even that
what is it then
we have said that atho love dartagnan like a child and thi somber
and inflex personag felt the anxieti of a parent for the young
man
onli graze a littl repli dartagnan my finger were caught
between two stonesthat of the wall and that of my ringand the skin
wa broken
that come of wear diamond my master said atho disdainfulli
ah to be sure cri portho there is a diamond why the devil
then do we plagu ourselv about monei when there is a diamond
stop a bit said arami
well thought of portho thi time you have an idea
undoubtedli said portho draw himself up at athoss compliment
as there is a diamond let us sell it
but said dartagnan it is the queen diamond
the stronger reason why it should be sold repli atho the queen
save monsieur de buckingham her lover noth more just the queen
save us her friend noth more moral let us sell the diamond
what sai monsieur the abb i dont ask portho hi opinion ha been
given
why i think said arami blush as usual that hi ring not
come from a mistress and consequ not be a love token
dartagnan mai sell it
my dear arami you speak like theologi personifi your advic
then is
to sell the diamond repli arami
well then said dartagnan gaili let us sell the diamond and sai
no more about it
the fusillad continu but the four friend were out of reach and
the rochellai onli fire to appeas their conscienc
my faith it wa time that idea came into porthoss head here we ar
at the camp therefor gentlemen not a word more of thi affair we
ar observ thei ar come to meet us we shall be carri in
triumph
in fact as we have said the whole camp wa in motion more than two
thousand person had assist as at a spectacl in thi fortun but
wild undertak of the four friendsan undertak of which thei were
far from suspect the real motiv noth wa heard but cri of
live the musket live the guard m de busigni wa the first to
come and shake atho by the hand and acknowledg that the wager wa
lost the dragoon and the swiss follow him and all their comrad
follow the dragoon and the swiss there wa noth but
felicit pressur of the hand and embrac there wa no end to
the inextinguish laughter at the rochellai the tumult at length
becam so great that the cardin fanci there must be some riot and
sent la houdinir hi captain of the guard to inquir what wa
go on
the affair wa describ to the messeng with all the effervesc of
enthusiasm
well ask the cardin on see la houdinir return
well monseigneur repli the latter three musket and a
guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigni that thei would go and
breakfast in the bastion st gervai and while breakfast thei held
it for two hour against the enemi and have kill i dont know how
mani rochellai
did you inquir the name of those three musket
ye monseigneur
what ar their name
messieur atho portho and arami
still my three brave fellow murmur the cardin and the
guardsman
dartagnan
still my young scapegrac posit these four men must be on my
side
the same even the cardin spoke to m de trvill of the exploit of
the morn which wa the talk of the whole camp m de trvill who
had receiv the account of the adventur from the mouth of the hero
of it relat it in all it detail to hi emin not forget
the episod of the napkin
that well monsieur de trvill said the cardin prai let that
napkin be sent to me i will have three fleurd embroid on
it in gold and will give it to your compani as a standard
monseigneur said m de trvill that will be unjust to the
guardsmen monsieur dartagnan is not with me he serv under monsieur
dessessart
well then take him said the cardin when four men ar so much
attach to on anoth it is onli fair that thei should serv in the
same compani
that same even m de trvill announc thi good new to the three
musket and dartagnan invit all four to breakfast with him next
morn
dartagnan wa besid himself with joi we know that the dream of hi
life had been to becom a musket the three friend were likewis
greatli delight
my faith said dartagnan to atho you had a triumphant idea as
you said we have acquir glori and were enabl to carri on a
convers of the highest import
which we can resum now without anybodi suspect us for with the
help of god we shall henceforth pass for cardinalist
that even dartagnan went to present hi respect to m dessessart
and inform him of hi promot
m dessessart who esteem dartagnan made him offer of help as
thi chang would entail expens for equip
dartagnan refus but think the opportun a good on he beg
him to have the diamond he put into hi hand valu as he wish to
turn it into monei
the next dai m dessessart valet came to dartagnan lodg and
gave him a bag contain seven thousand livr
thi wa the price of the queen diamond
chapter xlviii
a famili affair
atho had invent the phrase famili affair a famili affair wa not
subject to the investig of the cardin a famili affair concern
nobodi peopl might emploi themselv in a famili affair befor all
the world therefor atho had invent the phrase famili affair
arami had discov the idea the lackei
portho had discov the mean the diamond
dartagnan alon had discov nothingh ordinarili the most
invent of the four but it must be also said that the veri name of
miladi paralyz him
ah no we were mistaken he had discov a purchas for hi
diamond
the breakfast at m de trvill wa as gai and cheer as possibl
dartagnan alreadi wore hi uniformfor be nearli of the same size
as arami and as arami wa so liber paid by the publish who
purchas hi poem as to allow him to bui everyth doubl he sold
hi friend a complet outfit
dartagnan would have been at the height of hi wish if he had not
constantli seen miladi like a dark cloud hover in the horizon
after breakfast it wa agre that thei should meet again in the
even at athoss lodg and there finish their plan
dartagnan pass the dai in exhibit hi musket uniform in
everi street of the camp
in the even at the appoint hour the four friend met there onli
remain three thing to decidewhat thei should write to miladi
brother what thei should write to the clever person at tour and
which should be the lackei to carri the letter
everyon offer hi own atho talk of the discret of grimaud
who never spoke a word but when hi master unlock hi mouth portho
boast of the strength of mousqueton who wa big enough to thrash
four men of ordinari size arami confid in the address of bazin
made a pompou eulogium on hi candid final dartagnan had
entir faith in the braveri of planchet and remind them of the
manner in which he had conduct himself in the ticklish affair of
boulogn
these four virtu disput the prize for a length of time and gave
birth to magnific speech which we do not repeat here for fear thei
should be deem too long
unfortun said atho he whom we send must possess in himself
alon the four qualiti unit
but where is such a lackei to be found
not to be found cri atho i know it well so take grimaud
take mousqueton
take bazin
take planchet planchet is brave and shrewd thei ar two qualiti
out of the four
gentlemen said arami the princip question is not to know which
of our four lackei is the most discreet the most strong the most
clever or the most brave the princip thing is to know which love
monei the best
what arami sai is veri sensibl repli atho we must specul
upon the fault of peopl and not upon their virtu monsieur abb
you ar a great moralist
doubtless said arami for we not onli requir to be well serv in
order to succe but moreov not to fail for in case of failur
head ar in question not for our lackei
speak lower arami said atho
that wisenot for the lackei resum arami but for the
masterfor the master we mai sai ar our lackei suffici
devot to us to risk their live for us no
my faith said dartagnan i would almost answer for planchet
well my dear friend add to hi natur devoted a good sum of
monei and then instead of answer for him onc answer for him
twice
why good god you will be deceiv just the same said atho who
wa an optimist when thing were concern and a pessimist when men
were in question thei will promis everyth for the sake of the
monei and on the road fear will prevent them from act onc taken
thei will be press when press thei will confess everyth what
the devil we ar not children to reach englandatho lower hi
voiceal franc cover with spi and creatur of the cardin
must be cross a passport for embark must be obtain and the
parti must be acquaint with english in order to ask the wai to
london realli i think the thing veri difficult
not at all cri dartagnan who wa anxiou the matter should be
accomplish on the contrari i think it veri easi it would be no
doubt parbleu if we write to lord de winter about affair of vast
import of the horror of the cardin
speak lower said atho
of intrigu and secret of state continu dartagnan compli
with the recommend there can be no doubt we would all be broken
on the wheel but for god sake do not forget as you yourself said
atho that we onli write to him concern a famili affair that we
onli write to him to entreat that as soon as miladi arriv in london
he will put it out of her power to injur us i will write to him
then nearli in these term
let us see said atho assum in advanc a critic look

and you will do right handl the musket and the sword my dear
fellow you will come off splendidli at those two exercis but pass

the dai of expect ar long and dartagnan in particular would

necessari slow of navig he exagger to himself the power
of miladi he credit thi woman who appear to him the equal of a

wait quietli then in two hour in four in six hour at latest
planchet will be here he promis to be here and i have veri great
faith in planchet who appear to me to be a veri good lad

all who land in england
then you dont know me sir
it is the first time i have had the honor of see you
and on your honor you have no caus of hatr against me
none i swear to you
there wa so much seren cool mild even in the voic of
the young man that miladi felt reassur
at length after a journei of nearli an hour the carriag stop
befor an iron gate which close an avenu lead to a castl sever
in form massiv and isol then as the wheel roll over a fine
gravel miladi could hear a vast roar which she at onc recogn
as the nois of the sea dash against some steep cliff
the carriag pass under two arch gatewai and at length stop in
a court larg dark and squar almost immedi the door of the
carriag wa open the young man sprang lightli out and present hi
hand to miladi who lean upon it and in her turn alight with
toler calm
still then i am a prison said miladi look around her and
bring back her ey with a most graciou smile to the young offic
but i feel assur it will not be for long ad she my own
conscienc and your polit sir ar the guarante of that
howev flatter thi compliment the offic made no repli but
draw from hi belt a littl silver whistl such as boatswain us
in ship of war he whistl three time with three differ
modul immedi sever men appear who unhar the
smoke hors and put the carriag into a coach hous
then the offic with the same calm polit invit hi prison
to enter the hous she with a stillsmil counten took hi
arm and pass with him under a low arch door which by a vault
passag light onli at the farther end led to a stone staircas
around an angl of stone thei then came to a massiv door which after
the introduct into the lock of a kei which the young man carri
with him turn heavili upon it hing and disclos the chamber
destin for miladi
with a singl glanc the prison took in the apart in it minutest
detail it wa a chamber whose furnitur wa at onc appropri for a
prison or a free man and yet bar at the window and outsid bolt
at the door decid the question in favor of the prison
in an instant all the strength of mind of thi creatur though drawn
from the most vigor sourc abandon her she sank into a larg
easi chair with her arm cross her head lower and expect
everi instant to see a judg enter to interrog her
but no on enter except two or three marin who brought her trunk
and packag deposit them in a corner and retir without speak
the offic superintend all these detail with the same calm
miladi had constantli seen in him never pronounc a word himself
and make himself obei by a gestur of hi hand or a sound of hi
whistl
it might have been said that between thi man and hi inferior spoken
languag did not exist or had becom useless
at length miladi could hold out no longer she broke the silenc in
the name of heaven sir cri she what mean all that is pass
put an end to my doubt i have courag enough for ani danger i can
forese for everi misfortun which i understand where am i and why
am i here if i am free why these bar and these door if i am a
prison what crime have i commit
you ar here in the apart destin for you madam i receiv
order to go and take charg of you on the sea and to conduct you to
thi castl thi order i believ i have accomplish with all the
exact of a soldier but also with the courtesi of a gentleman
there termin at least to the present moment the duti i had to
fulfil toward you the rest concern anoth person
and who is that other person ask miladi warmli can you not tell
me hi name
at the moment a great jingl of spur wa heard on the stair some
voic pass and fade awai and the sound of a singl footstep
approach the door
that person is here madam said the offic leav the entranc
open and draw himself up in an attitud of respect
at the same time the door open a man appear on the threshold he
wa without a hat carri a sword and flourish a handkerchief in
hi hand
miladi thought she recogn thi shadow in the gloom she support
herself with on hand upon the arm of the chair and advanc her head
as if to meet a certainti
the stranger advanc slowli and as he advanc after enter into
the circl of light project by the lamp miladi involuntarili drew

then when she had no longer ani doubt she cri in a state of stupor

leav us alon mr felton
chapter l
chat between brother and sister
dure the time which lord de winter took to shut the door close a
shutter and draw a chair near to hi sisterinlaw fauteuil
miladi anxious thought plung her glanc into the depth of
possibl and discov all the plan of which she could not even
obtain a glanc as long as she wa ignor into whose hand she had
fallen she knew her brotherinlaw to be a worthi gentleman a bold
hunter an intrepid player enterpris with women but by no mean
remark for hi skill in intrigu how had he discov her
arriv and caus her to be seiz why did he detain her
atho had drop some word which prove that the convers she had
with the cardin had fallen into outsid ear but she could not
suppos that he had dug a countermin so promptli and so boldli she
rather fear that her preced oper in england might have been
discov buckingham might have guess that it wa she who had cut
off the two stud and aveng himself for that littl treacheri but
buckingham wa incap of go to ani excess against a woman
particularli if that woman wa suppos to have act from a feel of
jealousi
thi supposit appear to her most reason it seem to her that
thei want to reveng the past and not to anticip the futur at
all event she congratul herself upon have fallen into the hand
of her brotherinlaw with whom she reckon she could deal veri
easili rather than into the hand of an acknowledg and intellig
enemi
ye let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheer
decid as she wa to draw from the convers in spite of all the
dissimul lord de winter could bring the revel of which she
stood in need to regul her futur conduct
you have then decid to come to england again said lord de
winter in spite of the resolut you so often express in pari
never to set your feet on british ground
miladi repli to thi question by anoth question to begin with
tell me said she how have you watch me so close as to be awar
beforehand not onli of my arriv but even of the dai the hour and
the port at which i should arriv
lord de winter adopt the same tactic as miladi think that as hi
sisterinlaw emploi them thei must be the best
but tell me my dear sister repli he what make you come to
england
i come to see you repli miladi without know how much she
aggrav by thi repli the suspicion to which dartagnan letter
had given birth in the mind of her brotherinlaw and onli desir to
gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood
ah to see me said de winter cunningli
to be sure to see you what is there astonish in that
and you had no other object in come to england but to see me
no
so it wa for me alon you have taken the troubl to cross the
channel
for you alon
the deuc what tender my sister
but am i not your nearest rel demand miladi with a tone of
the most touch ingenu
and my onli heir ar you not said lord de winter in hi turn
fix hi ey on those of miladi
whatev command she had over herself miladi could not help start
and as in pronounc the last word lord de winter place hi hand
upon the arm of hi sister thi start did not escap him
in fact the blow wa direct and sever the first idea that occur
to miladi mind wa that she had been betrai by kitti and that she
had recount to the baron the selfish avers toward himself of which
she had imprud allow some mark to escap befor her servant

offic
meanwhil the cardin look anxious for new from england but no
new arriv that wa not annoi and threaten
although la rochel wa invest howev certain success might
appearthank to the precaut taken and abov all to the dyke
which prevent the entranc of ani vessel into the besieg cityth
blockad might last a long time yet thi wa a great affront to the
king armi and a great inconveni to the cardin who had no
longer it is true to embroil loui xiii with ann of austriafor that
affair wa overbut he had to adjust matter for m de bassompierr
who wa embroil with the duc dangoulm
as to monsieur who had begun the sieg he left to the cardin the
task of finish it
the citi notwithstand the incred persever of it mayor had
attempt a sort of mutini for a surrend the mayor had hang the
mutin thi execut quiet the illdispos who resolv to
allow themselv to die of hungerthi death alwai appear to them
more slow and less sure than strangul
on their side from time to time the besieg took the messeng
which the rochellai sent to buckingham or the spi which buckingham
sent to the rochellai in on case or the other the trial wa soon
over the cardin pronounc the singl word hang the king wa
invit to come and see the hang he came languidli place himself
in a good situat to see all the detail thi amus him sometim a
littl and made him endur the sieg with patienc but it did not
prevent hi get veri tire or from talk at everi moment of
return to parisso that if the messeng and the spi had fail
hi emin notwithstand all hi invent would have found
himself much embarrass
nevertheless time pass on and the rochellai did not surrend the
last spy that wa taken wa the bearer of a letter thi letter told
buckingham that the citi wa at an extrem but instead of ad
if your succor doe not arriv within fifteen dai we will
surrend it ad quit simpli if your succor come not within
fifteen dai we shall all be dead with hunger when it come
the rochellai then had no hope but in buckingham buckingham wa
their messiah it wa evid that if thei on dai learn posit
that thei must not count on buckingham their courag would fail with
their hope
the cardin look then with great impati for the new from
england which would announc to him that buckingham would not come
the question of carri the citi by assault though often debat in
the council of the king had been alwai reject in the first place
la rochel appear impregn then the cardin whatev he said
veri well knew that the horror of bloodsh in thi encount in which
frenchman would combat against frenchman wa a retrograd movement of
sixti year impress upon hi polici and the cardin wa at that
period what we now call a man of progress in fact the sack of la
rochel and the assassin of three of four thousand huguenot who
allow themselv to be kill would resembl too close in 1628
the massacr of st bartholomew in 1572 and then abov all thi thi
extrem measur which wa not at all repugn to the king good
cathol as he wa alwai fell befor thi argument of the besieg
generalsla rochel is impregn except to famin
the cardin could not drive from hi mind the fear he entertain of
hi terribl emissaryfor he comprehend the strang qualiti of thi
woman sometim a serpent sometim a lion had she betrai him wa
she dead he knew her well enough in all case to know that whether
act for or against him as a friend or an enemi she would not
remain motionless without great impedi but whenc did these
impedi aris that wa what he could not know
and yet he reckon and with reason on miladi he had divin in the
past of thi woman terribl thing which hi red mantl alon could
cover and he felt from on caus or anoth that thi woman wa hi
own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior
to the danger which threaten her
he resolv then to carri on the war alon and to look for no
success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortun chanc he
continu to press the rais of the famou dyke which wa to starv
la rochel meanwhil he cast hi ey over that unfortun citi
which contain so much deep miseri and so mani heroic virtu and
recal the sai of loui xi hi polit predecessor as he
himself wa the predecessor of robespierr he repeat thi maxim of
tristan gossip divid in order to reign
henri iv when besieg pari had loav and provis thrown over
the wall the cardin had littl note thrown over in which he
repres to the rochellai how unjust selfish and barbar wa
the conduct of their leader these leader had corn in abund and
would not let them partak of it thei adopt as a maximfor thei
too had maximsthat it wa of veri littl consequ that women
children and old men should die so long as the men who were to defend
the wall remain strong and healthi up to that time whether from
devoted or from want of power to act against it thi maxim
without be gener adopt nevertheless pass from theori into
practic but the note did it injuri the note remind the men that
the children women and old men whom thei allow to die were their
son their wive and their father and that it would be more just
for everyon to be reduc to the common miseri in order that equal
condit should give birth to unanim resolut
these note had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in
that thei induc a great number of the inhabit to open privat
negoti with the royal armi
but at the moment when the cardin saw hi mean alreadi bear
fruit and applaud himself for have put it in action an inhabit
of la rochel who had contriv to pass the royal linesgod know how
such wa the watch of bassompierr schomberg and the duc
dangoulm themselv watch over by the cardinalan inhabit of
la rochel we sai enter the citi come from portsmouth and
sai that he had seen a magnific fleet readi to sail within eight
dai still further buckingham announc to the mayor that at length
the great leagu wa about to declar itself against franc and that
the kingdom would be at onc invad by the english imperi and
spanish armi thi letter wa read publicli in all part of the citi
copi were put up at the corner of the street and even thei who had
begun to open negoti interrupt them be resolv to await
the succor so pompous announc
thi unexpect circumst brought back richelieu former anxieti
and forc him in spite of himself onc more to turn hi ey to the
other side of the sea
dure thi time exempt from the anxieti of it onli and true chief
the royal armi led a joyou life neither provis nor monei be
want in the camp all the corp rival on anoth in audac and
gaieti to take spi and hang them to make hazard expedit upon
the dyke or the sea to imagin wild plan and to execut them
coollysuch were the pastim which made the armi find these dai short
which were not onli so long to the rochellai a prei to famin and
anxieti but even to the cardin who blockad them so close
sometim when the cardin alwai on horseback like the lowest
gendarm of the armi cast a pensiv glanc over those work so
slowli keep pace with hi wish which the engin brought from
all the corner of franc were execut under hi order if he met a
musket of the compani of trvill he drew near and look at him in
a peculiar manner and not recogn in him on of our four
companion he turn hi penetr look and profound thought in
anoth direct
on dai when oppress with a mortal weari of mind without hope in
the negoti with the citi without new from england the cardin
went out without ani other aim than to be out of door and
accompani onli by cahusac and la houdinir stroll along the
beach mingl the immens of hi dream with the immens of the
ocean he came hi hors go at a foot pace to a hill from the
top of which he perceiv behind a hedg reclin on the sand and
catch in it passag on of those rai of the sun so rare at thi
period of the year seven men surround by empti bottl four of
these men were our musket prepar to listen to a letter on of
them had just receiv thi letter wa so import that it made them
forsak their card and their dice on the drumhead
the other three were occupi in open an enorm flagon of
collicur wine these were the lackei of these gentlemen
the cardin wa as we have said in veri low spirit and noth
when he wa in that state of mind increas hi depress so much as
gaieti in other besid he had anoth strang fanci which wa
alwai to believ that the caus of hi sad creat the gaieti of
other make a sign to la houdinir and cahusac to stop he alight
from hi hors and went toward these suspect merri companion
hope by mean of the sand which deaden the sound of hi step and
of the hedg which conceal hi approach to catch some word of thi
convers which appear so interest at ten pace from the hedg
he recogn the talk gascon and as he had alreadi perceiv
that these men were musket he did not doubt that the three other
were those call the insepar that is to sai atho portho and
arami
it mai be suppos that hi desir to hear the convers wa
augment by thi discoveri hi ey took a strang express and
with the step of a tigercat he advanc toward the hedg but he had
not been abl to catch more than a few vagu syllabl without ani
posit sens when a sonor and short cry made him start and
attract the attent of the musket

felton survei her for an instant with hi usual impass then

felton approach her and said lord de winter who is a cathol
like yourself madam think that the depriv of the rite and
ceremoni of your church might be pain to you ha consent that
you should read everi dai the ordinari of your mass and here is a book
which contain the ritual
at the manner in which felton laid the book upon the littl tabl near
which miladi wa sit at the tone in which he pronounc the two
word your mass at the disdain smile with which he accompani
them miladi rais her head and look more attent at the
offic
by that plain arrang of the hair by that costum of extrem
simplic by the brow polish like marbl and as hard and
impenetr she recogn on of those gloomi puritan she had so
often met not onli in the court of king jame but in that of the king
of franc where in spite of the remembr of the st bartholomew
thei sometim came to seek refug
she then had on of those sudden inspir which onli peopl of
geniu receiv in great crise in suprem moment which ar to decid
their fortun or their live
those two word your mass and a simpl glanc cast upon felton
reveal to her all the import of the repli she wa about to make
but with that rapid of intellig which wa peculiar to her thi
repli readi arrang present itself to her lip
i said she with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she
had remark in the voic of the young offic i sir my mass
lord de winter the corrupt cathol know veri well that i am not
of hi religion and thi is a snare he wish to lai for me
and of what religion ar you then madam ask felton with an
astonish which in spite of the empir he held over himself he could
not entir conceal
i will tell it cri miladi with a feign exult on the dai
when i shall have suffer suffici for my faith
the look of felton reveal to miladi the full extent of the space she
had open for herself by thi singl word
the young offic howev remain mute and motionless hi look
alon had spoken
i am in the hand of my enemi continu she with that tone of
enthusiasm which she knew wa familiar to the puritan well let my
god save me or let me perish for my god that is the repli i beg you
to make to lord de winter and as to thi book ad she point to
the manual with her finger but without touch it as if she must be
contamin by it you mai carri it back and make us of it yourself
for doubtless you ar doubli the accomplic of lord de winterth
accomplic in hi persecut the accomplic in hi heresi
felton made no repli took the book with the same appear of
repugn which he had befor manifest and retir pensiv
lord de winter came toward five oclock in the even miladi had had
time dure the whole dai to trace her plan of conduct she receiv
him like a woman who had alreadi recov all her advantag
it appear said the baron seat himself in the armchair opposit
that occupi by miladi and stretch out hi leg carelessli upon
the hearth it appear we have made a littl apostasi
what do you mean sir
i mean to sai that sinc we last met you have chang your religion
you have not by chanc marri a protest for a third husband have

oh you need not avow thi religi indiffer my lord your
debaucheri and crime would vouch for it
what you talk of debaucheri madam messalina ladi macbeth either
i misunderstand you or you ar veri shameless
you onli speak thu becaus you ar overheard coolli repli miladi
and you wish to interest your jailer and your hangmen against me
my jailer and my hangmen heydai madam you ar take a poetic
tone and the comedi of yesterdai turn to a tragedi thi even as
to the rest in eight dai you will be where you ought to be and my
task will be complet
infam task impiou task cri miladi with the exult of a
victim who provok hi judg
my word said de winter rise i think the hussi is go mad
come come calm yourself madam puritan or ill remov you to a
dungeon it my spanish wine that ha got into your head is it not
but never mind that sort of intox is not danger and will
have no bad effect
and lord de winter retir swear which at that period wa a veri
knightli habit
felton wa inde behind the door and had not lost on word of thi
scene miladi had guess aright
ye go go said she to her brother the effect ar draw
near on the contrari but you weak fool will not see them until it
is too late to shun them
silenc wa reestablish two hour pass awai miladi supper wa
brought in and she wa found deepli engag in sai her prayer
aloudpray which she had learn of an old servant of her second
husband a most auster puritan she appear to be in ecstasi and did
not pai the least attent to what wa go on around her felton
made a sign that she should not be disturb and when all wa
arrang he went out quietli with the soldier
miladi knew she might be watch so she continu her prayer to the
end and it appear to her that the soldier who wa on duti at her
door did not march with the same step and seem to listen for the
moment she wish noth better she aros came to the tabl at but
littl and drank onli water
an hour after her tabl wa clear but miladi remark that thi
time felton did not accompani the soldier he fear then to see her
too often
she turn toward the wall to smilefor there wa in thi smile such an
express of triumph that thi smile alon would have betrai her
she allow therefor half an hour to pass awai and as at that
moment all wa silenc in the old castl as noth wa heard but the
etern murmur of the wavesthat immens break of the oceanwith her
pure harmoni and power voic she began the first couplet of
the psalm then in great favor with the puritan
thou leavest thy servant lord
to see if thei be strong
but soon thou dost afford
thy hand to lead them on
these vers were not excellentveri far from it but as it is well
known the puritan did not piqu themselv upon their poetri
while sing miladi listen the soldier on guard at her door
stop as if he had been chang into stone miladi wa then abl to
judg of the effect she had produc
then she continu her sing with inexpress fervor and feel
it appear to her that the sound spread to a distanc beneath the
vault roof and carri with them a magic charm to soften the heart
of her jailer it howev likewis appear that the soldier on dutya
zealou cathol no doubtshook off the charm for through the door he
call hold your tongu madam your song is as dismal as a de
profundi and if besid the pleasur of be in garrison here we
must hear such thing as these no mortal can hold out
silenc then exclaim anoth stern voic which miladi recogn
as that of felton what ar you meddl with stupid did anybodi
order you to prevent that woman from sing no you were told to
guard herto fire at her if she attempt to fly guard her if she
fli kill her but dont exce your order
an express of unspeak joi lighten the counten of miladi
but thi express wa fleet as the reflect of lightn
without appear to have heard the dialogu of which she had not lost
a word she began again give to her voic all the charm all the
power all the seduct the demon had bestow upon it
for all my tear my care
my exil and my chain
i have my youth my prayer
and god who count my pain
her voic of immens power and sublim express gave to the rude
unpolish poetri of these psalm a magic and an effect which the most
exalt puritan rare found in the song of their brethren and which
thei were forc to ornament with all the resourc of their
imagin felton believ he heard the sing of the angel who
consol the three hebrew in the furnac
miladi continu
on dai our door will op
with god come our desir
and if betrai that hope
to death we can aspir
thi vers into which the terribl enchantress threw her whole soul
complet the troubl which had seiz the heart of the young offic
he open the door quickli and miladi saw him appear pale as usual
but with hi ey inflam and almost wild
why do you sing thu and with such a voic said he
your pardon sir said miladi with mild i forgot that my song
ar out of place in thi castl i have perhap offend you in your
creed but it wa without wish to do so i swear pardon me then a
fault which is perhap great but which certainli wa involuntari
miladi wa so beauti at thi moment the religi ecstasi in which
she appear to be plung gave such an express to her counten
that felton wa so dazzl that he fanci he beheld the angel whom he
had onli just befor heard
ye ye said he you disturb you agit the peopl who live in
the castl
the poor senseless young man wa not awar of the incoher of hi
word while miladi wa read with her lynx ey the veri depth of
hi heart
i will be silent then said miladi cast down her ey with all
the sweet she could give to her voic with all the resign she
could impress upon her manner
no no madam said felton onli do not sing so loud particularli
at night
and at these word felton feel that he could not long maintain hi
sever toward hi prison rush out of the room
you have done right lieuten said the soldier such song
disturb the mind and yet we becom accustom to them her voic is so
beauti
chapter liv
captiv the third dai
felton had fallen but there wa still anoth step to be taken he
must be retain or rather he must be left quit alon and miladi but
obscur perceiv the mean which could lead to thi result
still more must be done he must be made to speak in order that he
might be spoken tofor miladi veri well knew that her greatest
seduct wa in her voic which so skillfulli ran over the whole
gamut of tone from human speech to languag celesti
yet in spite of all thi seduct miladi might failfor felton wa
forewarn and that against the least chanc from that moment she
watch all hi action all hi word from the simplest glanc of hi
ey to hi gestureseven to a breath that could be interpret as a
sigh in short she studi everyth as a skill comedian doe to

face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct wa more easi she
had laid that down the preced even to remain silent and
dignifi in hi presenc from time to time to irrit him by
affect disdain by a contemptu word to provok him to threat and
violenc which would produc a contrast with her own resignationsuch
wa her plan felton would see all perhap he would sai noth but
he would see
in the morn felton came as usual but miladi allow him to presid
over all the prepar for breakfast without address a word to
him at the moment when he wa about to retir she wa cheer with a
rai of hope for she thought he wa about to speak but hi lip move
without ani sound leav hi mouth and make a power effort to
control himself he sent back to hi heart the word that were about to
escap from hi lip and went out toward middai lord de winter

order to secur success the magic of a continu seduct wa
necessari nevertheless as we have said on circumst reassur

then as she had done the even befor she fell on her knee and
repeat her prayer aloud as on the even befor the soldier
stop hi march to listen to her
soon after she heard lighter step than those of the sentinel which
came from the end of the corridor and stop befor her door

the ardent ey of the young man through the narrow open but
whether thi wa realiti or vision he had thi time suffici
selfcommand not to enter

ascend of grief and beautyit wa too much for a visionari it wa
too much for a brain weaken by the ardent dream of an ecstat
faith it wa too much for a heart furrow by the love of heaven that
burn by the hatr of men that devour
miladi saw the troubl she felt by intuit the flame of the oppos
passion which burn with the blood in the vein of the young fanat
as a skill gener see the enemi readi to surrend march

convers so difficult to be sustain in the same exalt tone
she let her hand fall and as if the weak of the woman overpow

when lord de winter enter he wa sever pace from the prison

tone
there is myself repli miladi

chapter lvi
captiv the fifth dai
miladi had howev achiev a halftriumph and success doubl her
forc
it wa not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt
to let themselv be seduc and whom the gallant educ of a court
led quickli into her net miladi wa handsom enough not to find much
resist on the part of the flesh and she wa suffici skill
to prevail over all the obstacl of the mind
but thi time she had to contend with an unpolish natur
concentr and insens by forc of auster religion and it
observ had made felton a man inaccess to ordinari seduct
there ferment in that sublim brain plan so vast project so
tumultu that there remain no room for ani caprici or materi
lovethat sentiment which is fed by leisur and grow with corrupt
miladi had then made a breach by her fals virtu in the opinion of a
man horribl prejud against her and by her beauti in the heart of
a man hitherto chast and pure in short she had taken the measur of
motiv hitherto unknown to herself through thi experi made upon
the most rebelli subject that natur and religion could submit to
her studi
mani a time nevertheless dure the even she despair of fate and
of herself she did not invok god we veri well know but she had
faith in the geniu of evilthat immens sovereignti which reign in
all the detail of human life and by which as in the arabian fabl a
singl pomegran seed is suffici to reconstruct a ruin world
miladi be well prepar for the recept of felton wa abl to
erect her batteri for the next dai she knew she had onli two dai
left that when onc the order wa sign by buckinghamand buckingham
would sign it the more readili from it bear a fals name and he
could not therefor recogn the woman in questiononc thi order
wa sign we sai the baron would make her embark immedi and
she knew veri well that women condemn to exil emploi arm much less
power in their seduct than the pretendedli virtuou woman whose
beauti is light by the sun of the world whose style the voic of
fashion laud and whom a halo of aristocraci gild with enchant
splendor to be a woman condemn to a pain and disgrac
punish is no impedi to beauti but it is an obstacl to the
recoveri of power like all person of real geniu miladi knew what
suit her natur and her mean poverti wa repugn to her
degrad took awai twothird of her great miladi wa onli a
queen while among queen the pleasur of satisfi pride wa necessari

she should certainli return from her exilesh did not doubt that a
singl instant but how long might thi exil last for an activ
ambiti natur like that of miladi dai not spent in climb ar
inauspici dai what word then can be found to describ the dai
which thei occupi in descend to lose a year two year three
year is to talk of an etern to return after the death or disgrac
of the cardin perhap to return when dartagnan and hi friend
happi and triumphant should have receiv from the queen the reward
thei had well acquir by the servic thei had render herthes were
devour idea that a woman like miladi could not endur for the
rest the storm which rage within her doubl her strength and she
would have burst the wall of her prison if her bodi had been abl to
take for a singl instant the proport of her mind
then that which spur her on addition in the midst of all thi
wa the remembr of the cardin what must the mistrust
restless suspici cardin think of her silenceth cardin not

but still further the princip instrument of her futur fortun and
vengeanc she knew him she knew that at her return from a fruitless
journei it would be in vain to tell him of her imprison in vain to
enlarg upon the suffer she had undergon the cardin would
repli with the sarcast calm of the skeptic strong at onc by
power and geniu you should not have allow yourself to be taken
then miladi collect all her energi murmur in the depth of her
soul the name of feltonth onli beam of light that penetr to her
in the hell into which she had fallen and like a serpent which fold
and unfold it ring to ascertain it strength she envelop felton
beforehand in the thousand mesh of her invent imagin

well said the baron on leav her you will not escap tonight
at ten oclock felton came and place the sentinel miladi recogn
hi step she wa as well acquaint with it now as a mistress is with

felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the tabl as he had
agre with the prison
miladi follow him with her ey and made a gestur of satisfact
now said she listen to me
the request wa needless the young offic stood upright befor her
await her word as if to devour them
felton said miladi with a solemn full of melancholi imagin
that your sister the daughter of your father speak to you while yet
young unfortun handsom i wa drag into a snare i resist
ambush and violenc multipli around me but i resist the
religion i serv the god i ador were blasphem becaus i call

could not conquer on even he mix a power narcot with my
water scarc had i finish my repast when i felt myself sink by
degre into a strang torpor although i wa without mistrust a vagu
fear seiz me and i tri to struggl against sleepi i aros i
wish to run to the window and call for help but my leg refus
their offic it appear as if the ceil sank upon my head and
crush me with it weight i stretch out my arm i tri to speak
i could onli utter inarticul sound and irresist faint came
over me i support myself by a chair feel that i wa about to
fall but thi support wa soon insuffici on account of my weak
arm i fell upon on knee then upon both i tri to prai but my
tongu wa frozen god doubtless neither heard nor saw me and i sank
upon the floor a prei to a slumber which resembl death
of all that pass in that sleep or the time which glide awai while
it last i have no remembr the onli thing i recollect is that i
awok in bed in a round chamber the furnitur of which wa sumptuou
and into which light onli penetr by an open in the ceil no
door gave entranc to the room it might be call a magnific
prison
it wa a long time befor i wa abl to make out what place i wa in
or to take account of the detail i describ my mind appear to
strive in vain to shake off the heavi dark of the sleep from which
i could not rous myself i had vagu percept of space travers
of the roll of a carriag of a horribl dream in which my strength
had becom exhaust but all thi wa so dark and so indistinct in my
mind that these event seem to belong to anoth life than mine and
yet mix with mine in fantast dualiti
at time the state into which i had fallen appear so strang that i
believ myself dream i aros trembl my cloth were near me on
a chair i neither rememb have undress myself nor go to bed
then by degre the realiti broke upon me full of chast terror i
wa no longer in the hous where i had dwelt as well as i could judg
by the light of the sun the dai wa alreadi twothird gone it wa
the even befor when i had fallen asleep my sleep then must have
last twentyfour hour what had taken place dure thi long sleep
i dress myself as quickli as possibl my slow and stiff motion all
attest that the effect of the narcot were not yet entir
dissip the chamber wa evid furnish for the recept of a
woman and the most finish coquett could not have form a wish but
on cast her ey about the apart she would have found that wish
accomplish
certainli i wa not the first captiv that had been shut up in thi
splendid prison but you mai easili comprehend felton that the more
superb the prison the greater wa my terror
ye it wa a prison for i tri in vain to get out of it i sound
all the wall in the hope of discov a door but everywher the
wall return a full and flat sound
i made the tour of the room at least twenti time in search of an
outlet of some kind but there wa none i sank exhaust with fatigu
and terror into an armchair
meantim night came on rapidli and with night my terror increas
i did not know but i had better remain where i wa seat it appear
that i wa surround with unknown danger into which i wa about to
fall at everi instant although i had eaten noth sinc the even
befor my fear prevent my feel hunger
no nois from without by which i could measur the time reach me i
onli suppos it must be seven or eight oclock in the even for it
wa in the month of octob and it wa quit dark
all at onc the nois of a door turn on it hing made me start
a globe of fire appear abov the glaze open of the ceil
cast a strong light into my chamber and i perceiv with terror
that a man wa stand within a few pace of me
a tabl with two cover bear a supper readi prepar stood as
if by magic in the middl of the apart
that man wa he who had pursu me dure a whole year who had vow
my dishonor and who by the first word that issu from hi mouth
gave me to understand he had accomplish it the preced night
scoundrel murmur felton
oh ye scoundrel cri miladi see the interest which the young
offic whose soul seem to hang on her lip took in thi strang
recit oh ye scoundrel he believ have triumph over me in
my sleep that all wa complet he came hope that i would accept
my shame as my shame wa consumm he came to offer hi fortun in
exchang for my love
all that the heart of a woman could contain of haughti contempt and
disdain word i pour out upon thi man doubtless he wa
accustom to such reproach for he listen to me calm and smile
with hi arm cross over hi breast then when he thought i had said
all he advanc toward me i sprang toward the tabl i seiz a
knife i place it to my breast
take on step more said i and in addit to my dishonor you
shall have my death to reproach yourself with
there wa no doubt in my look my voic my whole person that
sincer of gestur of attitud of accent which carri convict
to the most pervers mind for he paus

allow me to consent to lose you thu after i have had the happi to
possess you onli a singl time adieu my charmer i will wait to pai
you my next visit till you ar in a better humor
at these word he blew a whistl the globe of fire which light the
room reascend and disappear i found myself again in complet
dark the same nois of a door open and shut wa repeat
the instant afterward the flame globe descend afresh and i wa
complet alon
thi moment wa fright if i had ani doubt as to my misfortun
these doubt had vanish in an overwhelm realiti i wa in the
power of a man whom i not onli detest but despisedof a man capabl
of anyth and who had alreadi given me a fatal proof of what he wa
abl to do
but who then wa thi man ask felton
i pass the night on a chair start at the least nois for toward
midnight the lamp went out and i wa again in dark but the night
pass awai without ani fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor dai
came the tabl had disappear onli i had still the knife in my hand
thi knife wa my onli hope
i wa worn out with fatigu sleepless inflam my ey i had not
dare to sleep a singl instant the light of dai reassur me i went
and threw myself on the bed without part with the emancip
knife which i conceal under my pillow
when i awok a fresh meal wa serv
thi time in spite of my terror in spite of my agoni i began to
feel a devour hunger it wa fortyeight hour sinc i had taken ani
nourish i at some bread and some fruit then rememb the
narcot mix with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which
wa place on the tabl but fill my glass at a marbl fountain fix
in the wall over my dress tabl
and yet notwithstand these precaut i remain for some time
in a terribl agit of mind but my fear were thi time
illfound i pass the dai without experienc anyth of the kind
i dread
i took the precaut to half empti the caraf in order that my
suspicion might not be notic
the even came on and with it dark but howev profound wa
thi dark my ey began to accustom themselv to it i saw amid
the shadow the tabl sink through the floor a quarter of an hour
later it reappear bear my supper in an instant thank to the
lamp my chamber wa onc more light
i wa determin to eat onli such thing as could not possibl have
anyth soporif introduc into them two egg and some fruit
compos my repast then i drew anoth glass of water from my
protect fountain and drank it
at the first swallow it appear to me not to have the same tast as
in the morn suspicion instantli seiz me i paus but i had
alreadi drunk half a glass
i threw the rest awai with horror and wait with the dew of fear
upon my brow
no doubt some invis wit had seen me draw the water from that
fountain and had taken advantag of my confid in it the better to
assur my ruin so coolli resolv upon so cruelli pursu
half an hour had not pass when the same symptom began to appear
but as i had onli drunk half a glass of the water i contend longer
and instead of fall entir asleep i sank into a state of
drowsi which left me a percept of what wa pass around me
while depriv me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly
i drag myself toward the bed to seek the onli defens i had
leftmi save knife but i could not reach the bolster i sank on my
knee my hand clasp round on of the bedpost then i felt that i
wa lost
felton becam frightfulli pale and a convuls tremor crept through
hi whole bodi
and what wa most fright continu miladi her voic alter as
if she still experienc the same agoni as at that aw minut wa
that at thi time i retain a conscious of the danger that
threaten me wa that my soul if i mai sai so wake in my sleep
bodi wa that i saw that i heard it is true that all wa like a
dream but it wa not the less fright
i saw the lamp ascend and leav me in dark then i heard the
wellknown creak of the door although i had heard that door open but
twice
i felt instinct that someon approach me it is said that the
doom wretch in the desert of america thu feel the approach of the
serpent
i wish to make an effort i attempt to cry out by an incred
effort of will i even rais myself up but onli to sink down again
immedi and to fall into the arm of my persecutor
tell me who thi man wa cri the young offic
miladi saw at a singl glanc all the pain feel she inspir in
felton by dwell on everi detail of her recit but she would not
spare him a singl pang the more profoundli she wound hi heart the
more certainli he would aveng her she continu then as if she had
not heard hi exclam or as if she thought the moment wa not yet
come to repli to it
onli thi time it wa no longer an inert bodi without feel that
the villain had to deal with i have told you that without be abl
to regain the complet exercis of my faculti i retain the sens
of my danger i struggl then with all my strength and doubtless
oppos weak as i wa a long resist for i heard him cry out
these miser puritan i knew veri well that thei tire out their
execution but i did not believ them so strong against their
lover
ala thi desper resist could not last long i felt my
strength fail and thi time it wa not my sleep that enabl the
coward to prevail but my swoon
felton listen without utter ani word or sound except an inward
express of agoni the sweat stream down hi marbl forehead and
hi hand under hi coat tore hi breast
my first impuls on come to myself wa to feel under my pillow for
the knife i had not been abl to reach if it had not been us for
defens it might at least serv for expiat
but on take thi knife felton a terribl idea occur to me i
have sworn to tell you all and i will tell you all i have promis
you the truth i will tell it were it to destroi me
the idea came into your mind to aveng yourself on thi man did it
not cri felton
ye said miladi the idea wa not that of a christian i knew but
without doubt that etern enemi of our soul that lion roar
constantli around us breath it into my mind in short what shall i
sai to you felton continu miladi in the tone of a woman accus
herself of a crime thi idea occur to me and did not leav me it
is of thi homicid thought that i now bear the punish
continu continu said felton i am eager to see you attain your
vengeanc
oh i resolv that it should take place as soon as possibl i had no
doubt he would return the follow night dure the dai i had noth
to fear
when the hour of breakfast came therefor i did not hesit to eat
and drink i had determin to make believ sup but to eat noth i
wa forc then to combat the fast of the even with the
nourish of the morn
onli i conceal a glass of water which remain after my breakfast
thirst have been the chief of my suffer when i remain
fortyeight hour without eat or drink
the dai pass awai without have ani other influenc on me than to
strengthen the resolut i had form onli i took care that my face
should not betrai the thought of my heart for i had no doubt i wa
watch sever time even i felt a smile on my lip felton i dare
not tell you at what idea i smile you would hold me in horror
go on go on said felton you see plainli that i listen and that i
am anxiou to know the end
even came the ordinari event took place dure the dark as
befor my supper wa brought then the lamp wa light and i sat
down to tabl i onli at some fruit i pretend to pour out water
from the jug but i onli drank that which i had save in my glass the
substitut wa made so carefulli that my spi if i had ani could
have no suspicion of it
after supper i exhibit the same mark of languor as on the preced
even but thi time as i yield to fatigu or as if i had becom
familiar with danger i drag myself toward my bed let my robe
fall and lai down
i found my knife where i had place it under my pillow and while
feign to sleep my hand grasp the handl of it convuls
two hour pass awai without anyth fresh happen oh my god
who could have said so the even befor i began to fear that he
would not come
at length i saw the lamp rise softli and disappear in the depth of
the ceil my chamber wa fill with dark and obscur but i
made a strong effort to penetr thi dark and obscur
nearli ten minut pass i heard no other nois but the beat of
my own heart i implor heaven that he might come
at length i heard the wellknown nois of the door which open and
shut i heard notwithstand the thick of the carpet a step
which made the floor creak i saw notwithstand the dark a
shadow which approach my bed
hast hast said felton do you not see that each of your word

then continu miladi then i collect all my strength i recal
to my mind that the moment of vengeanc or rather of justic had
struck i look upon myself as anoth judith i gather myself up
my knife in my hand and when i saw him near me stretch out hi
arm to find hi victim then with the last cry of agoni and despair
i struck him in the middl of hi breast

of a furiou maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage cert

accordingli that same even miladi commenc her journei night
overtook her she stop and slept at an inn at five oclock the
next morn she again proceed and in three hour after enter
bthune she inquir for the convent of the carmelit and went
thither immedi
the superior met her miladi show her the cardin order the
abbess assign her a chamber and had breakfast serv
all the past wa effac from the ey of thi woman and her look
fix on the futur beheld noth but the high fortun reserv for
her by the cardin whom she had so successfulli serv without hi
name be in ani wai mix up with the sanguinari affair the evernew
passion which consum her gave to her life the appear of those
cloud which float in the heaven reflect sometim azur
sometim fire sometim the opaqu black of the tempest and
which leav no trace upon the earth behind them but devast and
death
after breakfast the abbess came to pai her a visit there is veri
littl amus in the cloister and the good superior wa eager to
make the acquaint of her new boarder
miladi wish to pleas the abbess thi wa a veri easi matter for a
woman so realli superior as she wa she tri to be agreeabl and she
wa charm win the good superior by her vari convers and
by the grace of her whole person
the abbess who wa the daughter of a nobl hous took particular
delight in stori of the court which so seldom travel to the
extrem of the kingdom and which abov all have so much
difficulti in penetr the wall of convent at whose threshold the
nois of the world di awai
miladi on the contrari wa quit convers with all aristocrat
intrigu amid which she had constantli live for five or six year
she made it her busi therefor to amus the good abbess with the
worldli practic of the court of franc mix with the eccentr
pursuit of the king she made for her the scandal chronicl of the
lord and ladi of the court whom the abbess knew perfectli by name
touch lightli on the amour of the queen and the duke of buckingham
talk a great deal to induc her auditor to talk a littl
but the abbess content herself with listen and smile without
repli a word miladi howev saw that thi sort of narr
amus her veri much and kept at it onli she now let her convers
drift toward the cardin
but she wa greatli embarrass she did not know whether the abbess
wa a royalist or a cardinalist she therefor confin herself to a
prudent middl cours but the abbess on her part maintain a
reserv still more prudent content herself with make a profound
inclin of the head everi time the fair travel pronounc the
name of hi emin
miladi began to think she should soon grow weari of a convent life she
resolv then to risk someth in order that she might know how to
act afterward desir of see how far the discret of the good
abbess would go she began to tell a stori obscur at first but veri
circumstanti afterward about the cardin relat the amour of
the minist with mme daiguillon marion de lorm and sever other
gai women
the abbess listen more attent grew anim by degre and
smile
good thought miladi she take a pleasur in my convers if
she is a cardinalist she ha no fanatic at least
she then went on to describ the persecut exercis by the cardin
upon hi enemi the abbess onli cross herself without approv or
disapprov
thi confirm miladi in her opinion that the abbess wa rather
royalist than cardinalist miladi therefor continu color her
narrat more and more
i am veri ignor of these matter said the abbess at length but
howev distant from the court we mai be howev remot from the
interest of the world we mai be place we have veri sad exampl of
what you have relat and on of our boarder ha suffer much from
the vengeanc and persecut of the cardin
on of your boarder said miladi oh my god poor woman i piti
her then
and you have reason for she is much to be piti imprison
menac ill treatmentsh ha suffer everyth but after all
resum the abbess monsieur cardin ha perhap plausibl motiv
for act thu and though she ha the look of an angel we must not
alwai judg peopl by the appear
good said miladi to herself who know i am about perhap to
discov someth here i am in the vein
she tri to give her counten an appear of perfect candor
ala said miladi i know it is so it is said that we must not
trust to the face but in what then shall we place confid if not
in the most beauti work of the lord as for me i shall be deceiv
all my life perhap but i shall alwai have faith in a person whose
counten inspir me with sympathi
you would then be tempt to believ said the abbess that thi
young person is innoc
the cardin pursu not onli crime said she there ar certain
virtu which he pursu more sever than certain offens
permit me madam to express my surpris said the abbess
at what said miladi with the utmost ingenu
at the languag you us
what do you find so astonish in that languag said miladi
smile
you ar the friend of the cardin for he send you hither and yet
and yet i speak ill of him repli miladi finish the thought of
the superior
at least you dont speak well of him
that is becaus i am not hi friend said she sigh but hi
victim
but thi letter in which he recommend you to me
is an order for me to confin myself to a sort of prison from which
he will releas me by on of hi satellit
but why have you not fled
whither should i go do you believ there is a spot on the earth which
the cardin cannot reach if he take the troubl to stretch forth hi
hand if i were a man that would bare be possibl but what can a
woman do thi young boarder of your ha she tri to fly
no that is true but shethat is anoth thing i believ she is
detain in franc by some love affair
ah said miladi with a sigh if she love she is not altogeth
wretch
then said the abbess look at miladi with increas interest i
behold anoth poor victim
ala ye said miladi
the abbess look at her for an instant with uneasi as if a fresh
thought suggest itself to her mind
you ar not an enemi of our holi faith said she hesitatingli
whoi cri miladi i a protest oh no i call to wit the
god who hear us that on the contrari i am a fervent cathol
then madam said the abbess smile be reassur the hous in
which you ar shall not be a veri hard prison and we will do all in
our power to make you cherish your captiv you will find here
moreov the young woman of whom i spoke who is persecut no doubt
in consequ of some court intrigu she is amiabl and
wellbehav
what is her name
she wa sent to me by someon of high rank under the name of kitti i
have not tri to discov her other name
kitti cri miladi what ar you sure
that she is call so ye madam do you know her
miladi smile to herself at the idea which had occur to her that
thi might be her old chambermaid there wa connect with the
remembr of thi girl a remembr of anger and a desir of
vengeanc disord the featur of miladi which howev
immedi recov the calm and benevol express which thi
woman of a hundr face had for a moment allow them to lose
and when can i see thi young ladi for whom i alreadi feel so great a
sympathi ask miladi
why thi even said the abbess todai even but you have been
travel these four dai as you told me yourself thi morn you
rose at five oclock you must stand in need of repos go to bed and
sleep at dinnertim we will rous you
although miladi would veri willingli have gone without sleep sustain
as she wa by all the excit which a new adventur awaken in her
heart ever thirst for intrigu she nevertheless accept the
offer of the superior dure the last fifteen dai she had experienc
so mani and such variou emot that if her frame of iron wa still
capabl of support fatigu her mind requir repos
she therefor took leav of the abbess and went to bed softli rock
by the idea of vengeanc which the name of kitti had natur brought
to her thought she rememb that almost unlimit promis which the
cardin had given her if she succeed in her enterpris she had
succeed dartagnan wa then in her power
on thing alon frighten her that wa the remembr of her
husband the comt de la fre whom she had believ dead or at least
expatri and whom she found again in athosth best friend of
dartagnan
but ala if he wa the friend of dartagnan he must have lent him hi
assist in all the proceed by whose aid the queen had defeat
the project of hi emin if he wa the friend of dartagnan he wa
the enemi of the cardin and she doubtless would succe in involv
him in the vengeanc by which she hope to destroi the young musket
all these hope were so mani sweet thought for miladi so rock by
them she soon fell asleep
she wa awaken by a soft voic which sound at the foot of her bed
she open her ey and saw the abbess accompani by a young woman
with light hair and delic complexion who fix upon her a look full
of benevol curios
the face of the young woman wa entir unknown to her each examin
the other with great attent while exchang the customari
compliment both were veri handsom but of quit differ style of
beauti miladi howev smile in observ that she excel the
young woman by far in her high air and aristocrat bear it is true
that the habit of a novic which the young woman wore wa not veri
advantag in a contest of thi kind
the abbess introduc them to each other when thi formal wa
end as her duti call her to chapel she left the two young women
alon
the novic see miladi in bed wa about to follow the exampl of
the superior but miladi stop her
how madam said she i have scarc seen you and you alreadi
wish to depriv me of your compani upon which i had count a littl
i must confess for the time i have to pass here
no madam repli the novic onli i thought i had chosen my time
ill you were asleep you ar fatigu
well said miladi what can those who sleep wish fora happi
awaken thi awaken you have given me allow me then to enjoi
it at my eas and take her hand she drew her toward the armchair
by the bedsid
the novic sat down
how unfortun i am said she i have been here six month without
the shadow of recreat you arriv and your presenc wa like to
afford me delight compani yet i expect in all probabl to quit
the convent at ani moment
how you ar go soon ask miladi
at least i hope so said the novic with an express of joi which
she made no effort to disguis
i think i learn you had suffer persecut from the cardin
continu miladi that would have been anoth motiv for sympathi
between us
what i have heard then from our good mother is true you have
likewis been a victim of that wick priest
hush said miladi let us not even here speak thu of him all my
misfortun aris from my have said nearli what you have said befor
a woman whom i thought my friend and who betrai me ar you also the
victim of a treacheri
no said the novic but of my devotionof a devot to a woman i
love for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give
it still
and who ha abandon youi that it
i have been suffici unjust to believ so but dure the last two
or three dai i have obtain proof to the contrari for which i thank
godfor it would have cost me veri dear to think she had forgotten me
but you madam you appear to be free continu the novic and if
you were inclin to fly it onli rest with yourself to do so
whither would you have me go without friend without monei in a
part of franc with which i am unacquaint and where i have never

give it an angel express my be alon or be persecut

come a moment when the good you have done plead your caus befor
god and see perhap it is a happi for you humbl and powerless
as i am that you have met with me for if i leav thi place welli
have power friend who after have exert themselv on my
account mai also exert themselv for you
oh when i said i wa alon said miladi hope to make the novic
talk by talk of herself it is not for want of friend in high
place but these friend themselv trembl befor the cardin the
queen herself doe not dare to oppos the terribl minist i have
proof that her majesti notwithstand her excel heart ha more
than onc been oblig to abandon to the anger of hi emin person
who had serv her

person but we must not put faith in appear the more thei ar
persecut the more she think of them and often when thei least
expect it thei have proof of a kind remembr

miladi had told the truthher head wa confus for her illarrang
plan clash on anoth like chao she requir to be alon that she
might put her thought a littl into order she saw vagu the futur
but she stood in need of a littl silenc and quiet to give all her
idea as yet confus a distinct form and a regular plan
what wa most press wa to get mme bonacieux awai and convei her
to a place of safeti and there if matter requir make her a
hostag miladi began to have doubt of the issu of thi terribl
duel in which her enemi show as much persever as she did
animos
besid she felt as we feel when a storm is come onthat thi issu
wa near and could not fail to be terribl
the princip thing for her then wa as we have said to keep mme
bonacieux in her power mme bonacieux wa the veri life of dartagnan
thi wa more than hi life the life of the woman he love thi wa
in case of ill fortun a mean of tempor and obtain good
condit
now thi point wa settl mme bonacieux without ani suspicion
accompani her onc conceal with her at armentir it would be
easi to make her believ that dartagnan had not come to bthune in
fifteen dai at most rochefort would be back besid dure that
fifteen dai she would have time to think how she could best aveng
herself on the four friend she would not be weari thank god for she
should enjoi the sweetest pastim such event could accord a woman of
her characterperfect a beauti vengeanc
revolv all thi in her mind she cast her ey around her and
arrang the topographi of the garden in her head miladi wa like a
good gener who contempl at the same time victori and defeat and
who is quit prepar accord to the chanc of the battl to march
forward or to beat a retreat
at the end of an hour she heard a soft voic call her it wa mme
bonacieux the good abbess had natur consent to her request
and as a commenc thei were to sup togeth
on reach the courtyard thei heard the nois of a carriag which
stop at the gate
miladi listen

safe and think that what you ar about to do is for hi sake

word go i will rejoin you
miladi ran up to her apart quickli she there found rochefort
lackei and gave him hi instruct
he wa to wait at the gate if by chanc the musket should appear
the carriag wa to set off as fast as possibl pass around the
convent and go and wait for miladi at a littl villag which wa
situat at the other side of the wood in thi case miladi would cross
the garden and gain the villag on foot as we have alreadi said
miladi wa admir acquaint with thi part of franc
if the musket did not appear thing were to go on as had been
agre mme bonacieux wa to get into the carriag as if to bid her
adieu and she wa to take awai mme bonacieux
mme bonacieux came in and to remov all suspicion if she had ani
miladi repeat to the lackei befor her the latter part of her
instruct
miladi ask some question about the carriag it wa a chais drawn
by three hors driven by a postillion rochefort lackei would
preced it as courier
miladi wa wrong in fear that mme bonacieux would have ani
suspicion the poor young woman wa too pure to suppos that ani femal
could be guilti of such perfidi besid the name of the comtess de
winter which she had heard the abbess pronounc wa wholli unknown to
her and she wa even ignor that a woman had had so great and so
fatal a share in the misfortun of her life
you see said she when the lackei had gone out everyth is
readi the abbess suspect noth and believ that i am taken by
order of the cardin thi man goe to give hi last order take the
least thing drink a finger of wine and let us be gone
ye said mme bonacieux mechan ye let us be gone
miladi made her a sign to sit down opposit pour her a small glass
of spanish wine and help her to the wing of a chicken
see said she if everyth doe not second us here is night
come on by daybreak we shall have reach our retreat and nobodi
can guess where we ar come courag take someth
mme bonacieux at a few mouth mechan and just touch the
glass with her lip

but at the moment the glass touch her lip her hand remain
suspend she heard someth on the road which sound like the
rattl of a distant gallop then it grew nearer and it seem to
her almost at the same time that she heard the neigh of hors
thi nois act upon her joi like the storm which awaken the sleeper
in the midst of a happi dream she grew pale and ran to the window
while mme bonacieux rise all in a trembl support herself upon
her chair to avoid fall noth wa yet to be seen onli thei heard
the gallop draw nearer
oh my god said mme bonacieux what is that nois

terribl cool stai where you ar i will tell you

hors might be count by the rattl of their hoof
miladi gaze with all the power of her attent it wa just light
enough for her to see who wa come
all at onc at the turn of the road she saw the glitter of lace
hat and the wave of feather she count two then five then eight
horsemen on of them preced the rest by doubl the length of hi
hors
miladi utter a stifl groan in the first horseman she recogn

approach of the musket set off at a gallop then three or four
shot were fire

dartagnan then relat the poison of mme bonacieux in the convent
of the carmelit at bthune the trial in the isol hous and the
execut on the bank of the ly
a shudder crept through the bodi of the cardin who did not shudder
readili
but all at onc as if undergo the influenc of an unspoken thought
the counten of the cardin till then gloomi clear up by
degre and recov perfect seren
so said the cardin in a tone that contrast strongli with the
sever of hi word you have constitut yourselv judg without
rememb that thei who punish without licens to punish ar
assassin
monseigneur i swear to you that i never for an instant had the
intent of defend my head against you i willingli submit to ani
punish your emin mai pleas to inflict upon me i do not hold
life dear enough to be afraid of death
ye i know you ar a man of a stout heart monsieur said the
cardin with a voic almost affection i can therefor tell you
beforehand you shall be tri and even condemn
anoth might repli to your emin that he had hi pardon in hi
pocket i content myself with sai command monseigneur i am
readi

and sign by whombi the king and the cardin pronounc these
word with a singular express of contempt

by me you ar insan monsieur
monseigneur will doubtless recogn hi own handwrit
and dartagnan present to the cardin the preciou piec of paper
which atho had forc from miladi and which he had given to
dartagnan to serv him as a safeguard
hi emin took the paper and read in a slow voic dwell upon
everi syllabl
dec 3 1627
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of
thi ha done what he ha done
richelieu
the cardin after have read these two line sank into a profound
reveri but he did not return the paper to dartagnan
he is medit by what sort of punish he shall caus me to die
said the gascon to himself well my faith he shall see how a
gentleman can die
the young musket wa in excel disposit to die heroic
richelieu still continu think roll and unrol the paper in
hi hand
at length he rais hi head fix hi eagl look upon that loyal
open and intellig counten read upon that face furrow with
tear all the suffer it possessor had endur in the cours of a
month and reflect for the third or fourth time how much there wa in
that youth of twentyon year befor him and what resourc hi
activ hi courag and hi shrewd might offer to a good master
on the other side the crime the power and the infern geniu of
miladi had more than onc terrifi him he felt someth like a
secret joi at be forev reliev of thi danger accomplic
richelieu slowli tore the paper which dartagnan had gener
relinquish
i am lost said dartagnan to himself and he bow profoundli befor
the cardin like a man who sai lord thy will be done
