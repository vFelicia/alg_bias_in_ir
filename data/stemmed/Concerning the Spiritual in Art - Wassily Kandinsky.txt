translat introduct
it is no common thing to find an artist who even if he be
will to try is capabl of express hi aim and ideal with
ani clear and moder some peopl will sai that ani such
capac is a flaw in the perfect artist who should find hi
express in line and colour and leav the multitud to grope
it wai unaid toward comprehens thi attitud is a relic
of the dai when lart pour lart wa the latest battl cry
when eccentr of manner and irregular of life were more
import than ani talent to the wouldb artist when everi on
except oneself wa bourgeoi
the last few year have in some measur remov thi absurd
by destroi the old convent that it wa middleclass to be
sane and that between the artist and the outerworld yawn a
gulf which few could cross modern artist ar begin to
realiz their social duti thei ar the spiritu teacher of
the world and for their teach to have weight it must be
comprehens ani attempt therefor to bring artist and
public into sympathi to enabl the latter to understand the
ideal of the former should be thoroughli welcom and such an
attempt is thi book of kandinski
the author is on of the leader of the new art movement in
munich the group of which he is a member includ painter
poet musician dramatist critic all work to the same
endth express of the soul of natur and human or as
kandinski term it the inner klang
perhap the fault of thi book of theoryor rather the
characterist most like to give caus for attacki the
tendenc to verbos philosophi especi in the hand of a
writer of german present inexhaust opportun for vagu
and grandiloqu languag partli for thi reason partli from
incompet i have not primarili attempt to deal with the
philosoph basi of kandinski art some probabl will find
in thi aspect of the book it chief interest but better servic
will be done to the author idea by leav them to the
reader judgement than by even the most expert critic
the power of a book to excit argument is often the best proof of
it valu and my own experi ha alwai been that those new
idea ar at onc most challeng and most stimul which
come direct from their author with no intermedi discuss
the task undertaken in thi introduct is a humbler but perhap
a more necessari on england throughout her histori ha shown
scant respect for sudden spasm of theori whether in polit
religion or art she demand an histor foundat for everi
belief and when such a foundat is not forthcom she mai
smile indulg but seriou interest is immedi withdrawn
i am keenli anxiou that kandinski art should not suffer thi
fate my person belief in hi sincer and the futur of hi
idea will go for veri littl but if it can be shown that he is
a reason develop of what we regard as seriou art that
he is no adventur strive for a momentari notorieti by the
strang of hi belief then there is a chanc that some
peopl at least will give hi art fair consider and that
of these peopl a few will come to love it as in my opinion it
deserv
postimpression that vagu and muchabus term is now almost a
household word that the name of the movement is better known than the
name of it chief leader is a sad misfortun larg caus by the
overrapid of it introduct into england within the space of two
short year a mass of artist from manet to the most recent of cubist
were thrust on a public who had hardli realiz impression the
inevit result ha been complet mental chao the tradit of which
true postimpression is the modern express ha been kept aliv
down the ag of european art by scatter and until late neglect
painter but not sinc the time of the socal byzantin not sinc
the period of which giotto and hi school were the final splendid
blossom ha the symbolist ideal in art held gener swai over the
naturalist the primit italian like their predecessor the
primit greek and in turn their predecessor the egyptian sought
to express the inner feel rather than the outer realiti
thi ideal tend to be lost to sight in the naturalist reviv
of the renaiss which deriv it inspir sole from
those period of greek and roman art which were preoccupi with
the express of extern realiti although the allembrac
geniu of michelangelo kept the symbolist tradit aliv it
is the work of el greco that merit the complet titl of
symbolist from el greco spring goya and the spanish influenc
on daumier and manet when it is rememb that in the
meantim rembrandt and hi contemporari notabl brouwer left
their mark on french art in the work of delacroix decamp and
courbet the wai will be seen clearli open to cezann and
gauguin
the phrase symbolist tradit is not us to express ani
consciou affin between the variou gener of artist as
kandinski sai the relationship in art ar not necessarili
on of outward form but ar found on inner sympathi of
mean sometim perhap frequent a similar of outward
form will appear but in trace spiritu relationship onli
inner mean must be taken into account
there ar of cours mani peopl who deni that primit art had an
inner mean or rather that what is call archaic express wa
dictat by anyth but ignor of repres method and
defect materi such peopl ar number among the bitterest
oppon of postimpression and inde it is difficult to see how
thei could be otherwis paint thei sai which seek to learn
from an ag when art wa howev sincer incompet and uneduc
deliber reject the knowledg and skill of centuri it will be
no easi matter to conquer thi assumpt that primit art is mere
untrain natur but until it is conquer there seem littl hope
for a sympathet understand of the symbolist ideal
the task is all the more difficult becaus of the analog drawn by
friend of the new movement between the neoprimit vision and that of
a child that the analog contain a grain of truth doe not make it the
less mischiev fresh of vision the child ha and fresh of
vision is an import element in the new movement but beyond thi a
parallel is nonexist must be nonexist in ani art other than
pure artifici it is on thing to ap ineptitud in techniqu and
anoth to acquir simplic of vision simplicityor rather
discrimin of visioni the trademark of the true
postimpressionist he observ and then select what is essenti the
result is a logic and veri sophist synthesi such a synthesi
will find express in simpl and even harsh techniqu but the process
can onli come after the naturalist process and not befor it the child
ha a direct vision becaus hi mind is unencumb by associ and
becaus hi power of concentr is unimpair by a multipl of
interest hi method of draw is immatur it variat from the
ordinari result from lack of capac
two exampl will make my mean clearer the child draw a landscap
hi pictur contain on or two object onli from the number befor hi
ey these ar the object which strike him as import so far good
but there is no relat between them thei stand isol on hi paper
mere lumpish shape the postimpressionist howev select hi
object with a view to express by their mean the whole feel of
the landscap hi choic fall on element which sum up the whole not
those which first attract immedi attent
again let us take the case of the definit religi pictur
footnot religion in the sens of aw is present in all true
art but here i us the term in the narrow sens to mean
pictur of which the subject is connect with christian or
other worship
it is not often that children draw religi scene more often battl
and pageant attract them but sinc the reviv of the religi
pictur is so notic a factor in the new movement sinc the
byzantin paint almost entir religi subject and final
sinc a book of such draw by a child of twelv ha recent been
publish i prefer to take them as my exampl daphn alien religi
draw have the grace charm of childhood but thei ar mere
childish echo of convent pretti her talent when matur
will turn to the charm rather than to the vigor there could be no
greater contrast between such draw and that ofsaycimabu
cimabu madonna ar not pretti women but huge solemn symbol their
head droop stiffli their tender is univers in gauguin agoni
in the garden the figur of christ is haggard with pain and grief
these artist have fill their pictur with a bitter experi which
no child can possibl possess i repeat therefor that the analog
between postimpression and childart is a fals analog and that
for a train man or woman to paint as a child paint is an
imposs footnot i am well awar that thi statement is at
varianc with kandinski who ha contribut a long articleub die
formfrageto der blaue reiter in which he argu the parallel between
postimpression and child vision as exemplifi in the work of henri
rousseau certainli rousseau vision is childlik he ha had no
artist train and pretend to none but i consid that hi art
suffer so greatli from hi lack of train that beyond a sentiment
interest it ha littl to recommend it
all thi doe not presum to sai that the symbolist school of
art is necessarili nobler than the naturalist i am make no
comparison onli a distinct when the differ in aim is
fulli realiz the primit can no longer be condemn as
incompet nor the modern as lunat for such a condemn
is made from a wrong point of view judgement must be pass not
on the failur to achiev natur but on the failur to
express the inner mean
the brief histor survei attempt abov end with the name of
cezann and gauguin and for the purpos of thi introduct for the
purpos that is to sai of trace the genealog of the cubist and of
kandinski these two name mai be taken to repres the modern
express of the symbolist tradit
the differ between them is subtl but goe veri deep for
both the ultim and intern signific of what thei paint
count for more than the signific which is momentari and
extern cezann saw in a tree a heap of appl a human face
a group of bath men or women someth more abid than
either photographi or impressionist paint could present he
paint the treeness of the tree as a modern critic ha
admir express it but in everyth he did he show the
architectur mind of the true frenchman hi landscap studi
were base on a profound sens of the structur of rock and
hill and be structur hi art depend essenti on
realiti though he did not scrupl and rightli to sacrific
accuraci of form to the inner need the materi of which hi art
wa compos wa drawn from the huge store of actual natur
gauguin ha greater solemn and fire than cezann hi pictur
ar tragic or passion poem he also sacrific convent
form to inner express but hi art tend ever toward the
spiritu toward that profound emphasi which cannot be
express in natur object nor in word true hi abandon
of repres method did not lead him to an abandon of
natur term of expressionthat is to sai human figur tree
and anim do appear in hi pictur but that he wa much
nearer a complet reject of represent than wa cezann is
shown by the cours follow by their respect discipl
the gener immedi subsequ to cezann herbin
vlaminck friesz marquet etc do littl more than exagger
cezann techniqu until there appear the first sign of
cubism these ar seen veri clearli in herbin object begin to
be treat in flat plane a round vase is repres by a
seri of plane set on into the other which at a distanc
blend into a curv thi is the first stage
the real plung into cubism wa taken by picasso who nurtur
on cezann carri to it perfectli logic conclus the
master structur treatment of natur represent
disappear start from a singl natur object picasso and
the cubist produc line and project angl till their canvas
ar cover with intric and often veri beauti seri of
balanc line and curv thei persist howev in give them
pictur titl which recal the natur object from which their
mind first took flight
with gauguin the case is differ the gener of hi discipl
which follow himi put it thu to distinguish them from hi actual
pupil at pont aven serusi and the restcarri the tendenc
further on hesit to mention derain for hi begin full of
vital and promis have given place to a dreari compromis with
cubism without visibl futur and abov all without humour but there
is no better exampl of the develop of synthet symbol than hi

here is work which keep the merest semblanc of convent
form which give it effect by startl mass of black and
white by sudden curv but more frequent by sudden angl
footnot the renaiss of the angl in art is an interest
featur of the new movement not sinc egyptian time ha it been
us with such nobl effect there is a paint of gauguin at
hagen of a row of tahitian women seat on a bench that
consist entir of a tell design in egyptian angl cubism
is the result of thi discoveri of the angl blend with the
influenc of cezann
in the process of the gradual abandon of natur form the
angl school is parallel by the curv school which also
descend wholli from gauguin the best known repres is
mauric deni but he ha becom a slave to sentiment and
ha been left behind matiss is the most promin french artist
who ha follow gauguin with curv in germani a group of young
men who form the neue kunstlevereinigung in munich work almost
entir in sweep curv and have reduc natur object
pure to flow decor unit
but while thei have follow gauguin lead in abandon
represent both of these two group of advanc ar lack in
spiritu mean their aim becom more and more decor
with an undercurr of suggest of simplifi form anyon who
ha studi gauguin will be awar of the intens spiritu valu
of hi work the man is a preacher and a psychologist univers
by hi veri unorthodoxi fundament becaus he goe deeper than
civil in hi discipl thi great element is want
kandinski ha suppli the need he is not onli on the track of
an art more pure spiritu than wa conceiv even by gauguin
but he ha achiev the final abandon of all repres
intent in thi wai he combin in himself the spiritu and
technic tendenc of on great branch of postimpression
the question most gener ask about kandinski art is what
is he try to do it is to be hope that thi book will do
someth toward answer the question but it will not do
everyth thispartli becaus it is imposs to put into
word the whole of kandinski ideal partli becaus in hi
anxieti to state hi case to court critic the author ha
been tempt to formul more than is wise hi analysi of
colour and their effect on the spectat is not the real basi
of hi art becaus if it were on could with the help of a
scientif manual describ on emot befor hi pictur
with perfect accuraci and thi is imposs
kandinski is paint music that is to sai he ha broken down
the barrier between music and paint and ha isol the pure
emot which for want of a better name we call the artist
emot anyon who ha listen to good music with ani enjoy
will admit to an unmistak but quit indefin thrill he
will not be abl with sincer to sai that such a passag gave
him such visual impress or such a harmoni rous in him such
emot the effect of music is too subtl for word and the
same with thi paint of kandinski speak for myself to
stand in front of some of hi draw or pictur give a keener
and more spiritu pleasur than ani other kind of paint but
i could not express in the least what give the pleasur
presum the line and colour have the same effect as harmoni
and rhythm in music have on the truli music that psycholog
come in no on can deni mani peopleperhap at present the
veri larg major of peoplehav their colourmus sens
dormant it ha never been exercis in the same wai mani peopl
ar unmusicaleith wholli by natur or partli for lack of
experi even when kandinski idea is univers understood
there mai be mani who ar not move by hi melodi for my part
someth within me answer to kandinski art the first time i
met with it there wa no question of look for represent
a harmoni had been set up and that wa enough
of cours colourmus is no new idea that is to sai attempt have been
made to plai composit in colour by flash and harmoni
footnot cf colour music by a wallac rimington hutchinson 6s
net also music ha been interpret in colour but i do not know of
ani previou attempt to paint without ani refer to music
composit which shall have on the spectat an effect wholli divorc
from repres associ kandinski refer to attempt to paint
in colourcounterpoint but that is a differ matter in that it is
the borrow from on art by anoth of pure technic method
without a previou impuls from spiritu sympathi
on is face then with the conflict claim of picasso and
kandinski to the posit of true leader of nonrepres
art picasso admir hail him just as thi introduct hail
kandinski as a visual musician the method and idea of each
rival ar so differ that the titl cannot be accord to both
in hi book kandinski state hi opinion of cubism and it fatal
weak and histori goe to support hi content the origin
of cubism in cezann in a structur art that ow it veri
exist to matter make it claim to pure emotion seem
unten emot ar not compos of strata and conflict
pressur onc abandon realiti and the geometr vision
becom abstract mathemat it seem to me that picasso share
a futurist error when he endeavour to harmon on item of
realitya number a button a few capit letterswith a
surround aura of angular project there must be a conflict
of impress which differ essenti in qualiti on trend of
modern music is toward realism of sound children cry dog
bark plate ar broken picasso approach the same goal from
the opposit direct it is as though he were try to work
from realism to music the wast of time is to my mind equal
complet in both case the power of music to give express
without the help of represent is it noblest possess no
paint ha ever had such a preciou power kandinski is
strive to give it that power and prove what is at least the
logic analog between colour and sound between line and rhythm
of beat picasso make littl us of colour and confin himself
onli to on seri of line effectsthos caus by conflict
angl so hi aim is smaller and more limit than kandinski
even if it is as reason but becaus it ha not wholli
abandon realism but us for the paint of feel a
structur vision depend for it valu on the associ of
realiti becaus in so do it tri to make the best of two
world there seem littl hope for it of redempt in either
as ha been said abov picasso and kandinski make an interest
parallel in that thei have develop the art respect of
cezann and gauguin in a similar direct on the decis of
picasso failur or success rest the distinct between
cezann and gauguin the realist and the symbolist the painter
of extern and the painter of religi feel unless a
spiritu valu is accord to cezann work unless he is
believ to be a religi painter and religi painter need
not paint madonna unless in fact he is parallel close with
gauguin hi follow picasso cannot claim to stand with
kandinski as a prophet of an art of spiritu harmoni
if kandinski ever attain hi idealfor he is the first to admit
that he ha not yet reach hi goalif he ever succe in
find a common languag of colour and line which shall stand
alon as the languag of sound and beat stand alon without
recours to natur form or represent he will on all hand
be hail as a great innov as a champion of the freedom of
art until such time it is the duti of those to whom hi work
ha spoken to bear their testimoni otherwis he mai be
condemn as on who ha invent a shorthand of hi own and who
paint pictur which cannot be understood by those who have not
the kei of the cipher in the meantim also it is import that
hi posit should be recogn as a legitim almost
inevit outcom of postimpressionist tendenc such is the
recognit thi introduct strive to secur

everi work of art is the child of it ag and in mani case the
mother of our emot it follow that each period of cultur
produc an art of it own which can never be repeat effort
to reviv the artprincipl of the past will at best produc an
art that is stillborn it is imposs for us to live and feel
as did the ancient greek in the same wai those who strive to
follow the greek method in sculptur achiev onli a similar
of form the work remain soulless for all time such imit
is mere ap extern the monkei complet resembl a human
be he will sit hold a book in front of hi nose and turn
over the page with a thought aspect but hi action have for
him no real mean
there is howev in art anoth kind of extern similar
which is found on a fundament truth when there is a
similar of inner tendenc in the whole moral and spiritu
atmospher a similar of ideal at first close pursu but
later lost to sight a similar in the inner feel of ani on
period to that of anoth the logic result will be a reviv
of the extern form which serv to express those inner
feel in an earlier ag an exampl of thi todai is our
sympathi our spiritu relationship with the primit like
ourselv these artist sought to express in their work onli
intern truth renounc in consequ all consider of
extern form
thi allimport spark of inner life todai is at present onli a
spark our mind which ar even now onli just awaken after
year of materi ar infect with the despair of unbelief
of lack of purpos and ideal the nightmar of materi which
ha turn the life of the univers into an evil useless game
is not yet past it hold the awaken soul still in it grip
onli a feebl light glimmer like a tini star in a vast gulf of
dark thi feebl light is but a presenti and the soul
when it see it trembl in doubt whether the light is not a
dream and the gulf of dark realiti thi doubt and the
still harsh tyranni of the materialist philosophi divid our
soul sharpli from that of the primit our soul ring crack
when we seek to plai upon it as doe a costli vase long buri
in the earth which is found to have a flaw when it is dug up
onc more for thi reason the primit phase through which we
ar now pass with it temporari similar of form can onli
be of short durat
these two possibl resembl between the art form of todai
and those of the past will be at onc recogn as diametr
oppos to on anoth the first be pure extern ha no
futur the second be intern contain the seed of the
futur within itself after the period of materialist effort
which held the soul in check until it wa shaken off as evil the
soul is emerg purg by trial and suffer shapeless
emot such as fear joi grief etc which belong to thi
time of effort will no longer greatli attract the artist he
will endeavour to awak subtler emot as yet unnam live
himself a complic and compar subtl life hi work
will give to those observ capabl of feel them lofti
emot beyond the reach of word
the observ of todai howev is seldom capabl of feel such
emot he seek in a work of art a mere imit of natur
which can serv some definit purpos for exampl a portrait in
the ordinari sens or a present of natur accord to a
certain convent impressionist paint or some inner
feel express in term of natur form as we saya pictur

more strongli to the third where the spectat doe feel a

limit beethoven is now ripe for an asylum of the open
phrase on a reiter e the abb stadler said to hi
neighbour when first he heard it alwai that miser e he
seem to be deaf to it himself the idiot
how mani year will it be befor a greater segment of the
triangl reach the spot where he onc stood alon despit
memori and statu ar thei realli mani who have risen to hi
level footnot 2 ar not mani monument in themselv answer
to that question
in everi segment of the triangl ar artist each on of them
who can see beyond the limit of hi segment is a prophet to
those about him and help the advanc of the obstin whole
but those who ar blind or those who retard the movement of the
triangl for baser reason ar fulli understood by their fellow
and acclaim for their geniu the greater the segment which is
the same as sai the lower it li in the triangl so the
greater the number who understand the word of the artist everi
segment hunger conscious or much more often unconsci
for their correspond spiritu food thi food is offer by
the artist and for thi food the segment immedi below will
tomorrow be stretch out eager hand
thi simil of the triangl cannot be said to express everi
aspect of the spiritu life for instanc there is never an
absolut shadowsid to the pictur never a piec of unreliev
gloom even too often it happen that on level of spiritu food
suffic for the nourish of those who ar alreadi in a higher
segment but for them thi food is poison in small quantiti it
depress their soul gradual into a lower segment in larg
quantiti it hurl them suddenli into the depth ever lower and

that thei ar spiritu thirsti and that from thi pure spring
thei mai quench their thirst such art doe not help the forward
movement but hinder it drag back those who ar strive to
press onward and spread pestil abroad
such period dure which art ha no nobl champion dure
which the true spiritu food is want ar period of
retrogress in the spiritu world ceaselessli soul fall from
the higher to the lower segment of the triangl and the whole
seem motionless or even to move down and backward men
attribut to these blind and dumb period a special valu for

wellb thei hail some technic advanc which can help
noth but the bodi as a great achiev real spiritu
gain ar at best undervalu at worst entir ignor
the solitari visionari ar despis or regard as abnorm and
eccentr those who ar not wrap in lethargi and who feel

in harsh choru without ani to comfort them the night of the

these blind and terrifi guid and their follow torment
and unnerv by fear and doubt prefer to thi gradual darken
the final sudden leap into the black
at such a time art minist to lower need and is us for
materi end she seek her substanc in hard realiti becaus
she know of noth nobler object the reproduct of which
is consid her sole aim remain monoton the same the
question what disappear from art onli the question how
remain by what method ar these materi object to be
reproduc the word becom a creed art ha lost her soul
in the search for method the artist goe still further art
becom so special as to be comprehens onli to artist
and thei complain bitterli of public indiffer to their work
for sinc the artist in such time ha no need to sai much but
onli to be notori for some small origin and consequ
laud by a small group of patron and connoisseur which
incident is also a veri profit busi for him there
aris a crowd of gift and skil painter so easi doe the
conquest of art appear in each artist circl ar thousand of
such artist of whom the major seek onli for some new
technic manner and who produc million of work of art
without enthusiasm with cold heart and soul asleep
competit aris the wild battl for success becom more and
more materi small group who have fought their wai to the top
of the chaotic world of art and picturemak entrench
themselv in the territori thei have won the public left far
behind look on bewild lose interest and turn awai
but despit all thi confus thi chao thi wild hunt for
notorieti the spiritu triangl slowli but sure with
irresist strength move onward and upward
the invis mose descend from the mountain and see the danc
round the golden calf but he bring with him fresh store of
wisdom to man
first by the artist is heard hi voic the voic that is
inaud to the crowd almost unknowingli the artist follow the
call alreadi in that veri question how li a hidden seed of
renaiss for when thi how remain without ani fruit
answer there is alwai a possibl that the same someth
which we call person todai mai be abl to see in the
object about it not onli what is pure materi but also
someth less solid someth less bodili than wa seen in
the period of realism when the univers aim wa to reproduc
anyth as it realli is and without fantast imagin
footnot frequent us is made here of the term materi and
nonmateri and of the intermedi phrase more or less
materi is everyth materi or is everyth spiritu
can the distinct we make between matter and spirit be noth
but rel modif of on or the other thought which
although a product of the spirit can be defin with posit
scienc is matter but of fine and not coars substanc is
whatev cannot be touch with the hand spiritu the
discuss li beyond the scope of thi littl book all that
matter here is that the boundari drawn should not be too
definit
if the emot power of the artist can overwhelm the how and
can give free scope to hi finer feel then art is on the
crest of the road by which she will not fail later on to find the
what she ha lost the what which will show the wai to the
spiritu food of the newli awaken spiritu life thi what
will no longer be the materi object what of the former
period but the intern truth of art the soul without which the
bodi ie the how can never be healthi whether in an
individu or in a whole peopl
thi what is the intern truth which onli art can divin
which onli art can express by those mean of express which ar
her alon
iii spiritu revolut
the spiritu triangl move slowli onward and upward todai
on of the largest of the lower segment ha reach the point of
us the first battl cry of the materialist creed the dweller
in thi segment group themselv round variou banner in
religion thei call themselv jew cathol protest etc
but thei ar realli atheist and thi a few either of the
boldest or the narrowest openli avow heaven is empti god is
dead in polit these peopl ar democrat and republican
the fear horror and hatr which yesterdai thei felt for these
polit creed thei now direct against anarch of which thei
know noth but it much dread name
in econom these peopl ar socialist thei make sharp the
sword of justic with which to slai the hydra of capit and
to hew off the head of evil
becaus the inhabit of thi great segment of the triangl
have never solv ani problem independ but ar drag as
it were in a cart by those the noblest of their fellowmen who
have sacrif themselv thei know noth of the vital
impuls of life which thei regard alwai vagu from a great
distanc thei rate thi impuls lightli put their trust in
purposeless theori and in the work of some logic method
the men of the segment next below ar drag slowli higher
blindli by those just describ but thei cling to their old
posit full of dread of the unknown and of betray the
higher segment ar not onli blind atheist but can justifi their
godless with strang word for exampl those of virchowso
unworthi of a learn mani have dissect mani corps but
never yet discov a soul in ani of them
in polit thei ar gener republican with a knowledg of
differ parliamentari procedur thei read the polit
lead articl in the newspap in econom thei ar
socialist of variou grade and can support their principl
with numer quotat pass from schweitzer emma via
lasal iron law of wage to marx capit and still
further
in these loftier segment other categori of idea absent in
these just describ begin gradual to appearsci and art
to which last belong also literatur and music
in scienc these men ar positivist onli recogn those
thing that can be weigh and measur anyth beyond that
thei consid as rather discredit nonsens that same
nonsens about which thei held yesterdai the theori that todai
ar proven
in art thei ar naturalist which mean that thei recogn and
valu the person individu and tempera of the
artist up to a certain definit point thi point ha been fix
by other and in it thei believ unflinchingli
but despit their patent and wellord secur despit their
infal principl there lurk in these higher segment a
hidden fear a nervou trembl a sens of insecur and thi
is due to their upbring thei know that the sage statesmen
and artist whom todai thei rever were yesterdai spurn as
swindler and charlatan and the higher the segment in the
triangl the better defin is thi fear thi modern sens of
insecur here and there ar peopl with ey which can see
mind which can correl thei sai to themselv if the
scienc of the dai befor yesterdai is reject by the peopl of
yesterdai and that of yesterdai by us of todai is it not
possibl that what we call scienc now will be reject by the
men of tomorrow and the bravest of them answer it is
possibl
then peopl appear who can distinguish those problem that the
scienc of todai ha not yet explain and thei ask themselv
will scienc if it continu on the road it ha follow for so
long ever attain to the solut of these problem and if it
doe so attain will men be abl to reli on it solut in
these segment ar also profession men of learn who can
rememb the time when fact now recogn by the academi as
firmli establish were scorn by those same academi there
ar also philosoph of aesthet who write profound book about
an art which wa yesterdai condemn as nonsens in write
these book thei remov the barrier over which art ha most
recent step and set up new on which ar to remain for ever
in the place thei have chosen thei do not notic that thei ar
busi erect barrier not in front of art but behind it and
if thei do notic thi on the morrow thei mere write fresh
book and hastili set their barrier a littl further on thi
perform will go on unalt until it is realiz that the
most extrem principl of aesthet can never be of valu to the
futur but onli to the past no such theori of principl can be
laid down for those thing which lie beyond in the realm of the
immateri that which ha no materi exist cannot be
subject to a materi classif that which belong to the
spirit of the futur can onli be realiz in feel and to thi
feel the talent of the artist is the onli road theori is the
lamp which shed light on the petrifi idea of yesterdai and of
the more distant past footnot cf chapter vii and as we
rise higher in the triangl we find that the uneasi
increas as a citi built on the most correct architectur plan
mai be shaken suddenli by the uncontrol forc of natur
human is live in such a spiritu citi subject to these
sudden disturb for which neither architect nor
mathematician have made allow in on place li a great
wall crumbl to piec like a card hous in anoth ar the
ruin of a huge tower which onc stretch to heaven built on
mani presum immort spiritu pillar the abandon
churchyard quak and forgotten grave open and from them rise
forgotten ghost spot appear on the sun and the sun grow dark
and what theori can fight with dark and in thi citi live
also men deafen by fals wisdom who hear no crash and blind
by fals wisdom so that thei sai our sun will shine more
brightli than ever and soon the last spot will disappear but
sometim even these men will hear and see
but when we get still higher there is no longer thi
bewilder there work is go on which boldli attack those
pillar which men have set up there we find other profession
men of learn who test matter again and again who trembl
befor no problem and who final cast doubt on that veri matter
which wa yesterdai the foundat of everyth so that the
whole univers is shaken everi dai anoth scientif theori
find bold discover who overstep the boundari of propheci
and forget of themselv join the other soldier in the
conquest of some new summit and in the hopeless attack on some
stubborn fortress but there is no fortress that man cannot
overcom
on the on hand fact ar be establish which the scienc of
yesterdai dub swindl even newspap which ar for the
most part the most obsequi servant of worldli success and of
the mob and which trim their sail to everi wind find
themselv compel to modifi their iron judgement on the
marvel of scienc and even to abandon them altogeth variou
learn men among them ultramaterialist dedic their
strength to the scientif research of doubt problem which
can no longer be li about or pass over in silenc footnot

on the other hand the number is increas of those men who put no
trust in the method of materialist scienc when it deal with those
question which have to do with nonmatt or matter which is not
access to our mind just as art is look for help from the
primit so these men ar turn to halfforgotten time in order to
get help from their halfforgotten method howev these veri method
ar still aliv and in us among nation whom we from the height of our
knowledg have been accustom to regard with piti and scorn to such
nation belong the indian who from time to time confront those learn

unnot or brush asid with superfici word and explan
footnot frequent in such case us is made of the word hypnot
that same hypnot which in it earlier form of mesmer wa
disdainfulli put asid by variou learn bodi mme blavatski wa
the first person after a life of mani year in india to see a
connect between these savag and our civil from that
moment there began a tremend spiritu movement which todai includ
a larg number of peopl and ha even assum a materi form in the
theosoph societi thi societi consist of group who seek to
approach the problem of the spirit by wai of the inner knowledg the
theori of theosophi which serv as the basi to thi movement wa set
out by blavatski in the form of a catech in which the pupil receiv
definit answer to hi question from the theosoph point of view
footnot e p blavatski the kei of theosophi london 1889
theosophi accord to blavatski is synonym with etern truth
the new torchbear of truth will find the mind of men prepar for
hi messag a languag readi for him in which to cloth the new truth
he bring an organ await hi arriv which will remov the
mere mechan materi obstacl and difficulti from hi path
and then blavatski continu the earth will be a heaven in the
twentyfirst centuri in comparison with what it is now and with these
word end her book
when religion scienc and moral ar shaken the two last by
the strong hand of nietzsch and when the outer support
threaten to fall man turn hi gaze from extern in on to
himself literatur music and art ar the first and most
sensit sphere in which thi spiritu revolut make itself
felt thei reflect the dark pictur of the present time and show
the import of what at first wa onli a littl point of light
notic by few and for the great major nonexist perhap
thei even grow dark in their turn but on the other hand thei
turn awai from the soulless life of the present toward those
substanc and idea which give free scope to the nonmateri
strive of the soul
a poet of thi kind in the realm of literatur is maeterlinck he
take us into a world which rightli or wrongli we term
supernatur la princess malein le sept princess le
aveugl etc ar not peopl of past time as ar the hero in
shakespear thei ar mere soul lost in the cloud threaten
by them with death etern menac by some invis and
sombr power
spiritu dark the insecur of ignor and fear pervad
the world in which thei move maeterlinck is perhap on of the
first prophet on of the first artist reform and seer to
herald the end of the decad just describ the gloom of the
spiritu atmospher the terribl but allguid hand the

similar line the imagin of the spectat plai in the
modern theatr and especi in that of russia an import

maeterlinck princip technic weapon is hi us of word the

if the object is not itself seen but onli it name heard the
mind of the hearer receiv an abstract impress onli that is

vibrat is immedi set up in the heart
the apt us of a word in it poetic mean repetit of thi
word twice three time or even more frequent accord to the need
of the poem will not onli tend to intensifi the inner harmoni but also
bring to light unsuspect spiritu properti of the word itself
further than that frequent repetit of a word again a favourit game

show that thunder lightn and a moon behind drive cloud in
themselv materi mean can be us in the theatr to creat a
greater sens of terror than thei do in natur
the true inner forc do not lose their strength and effect so
easili footnot a comparison between the work of poe and
maeterlinck show the cours of artist transit from the
materi to the abstract an the word which ha two mean
the first direct the second indirect is the pure materi of
poetri and of literatur the materi which these art alon can
manipul and through which thei speak to the spirit
someth similar mai be notic in the music of wagner hi
famou leitmotiv is an attempt to give person to hi
charact by someth beyond theatric expedi and light
effect hi method of us a definit motiv is a pure music
method it creat a spiritu atmospher by mean of a music
phrase which preced the hero which he seem to radiat forth
from ani distanc footnot frequent attempt have shown that
such a spiritu atmospher can belong not onli to hero but to
ani human be sensit cannot for exampl remain in a room
in which a person ha been who is spiritu antagonist to
them even though thei know noth of hi exist the most
modern musician like debussi creat a spiritu impress
often taken from natur but embodi in pure music form for
thi reason debussi is often class with the impressionist
painter on the ground that he resembl these painter in us
natur phenomena for the purpos of hi art whatev truth
there mai be in thi comparison mere accentu the fact that
the variou art of todai learn from each other and often
resembl each other but it would be rash to sai that thi
definit is an exhaust statement of debussi signific
despit hi similar with the impressionist thi musician is
deepli concern with spiritu harmoni for in hi work on
hear the suffer and tortur nerv of the present time and
further debussi never us the wholli materi note so
characterist of programm music but trust mainli in the
creation of a more abstract impress debussi ha been greatli
influenc by russian music notabl by mussorgski so it is not
surpris that he stand in close relat to the young russian
compos the chief of whom is scriabin the experi of the
hearer is frequent the same dure the perform of the work
of these two musician he is often snatch quit suddenli from
a seri of modern discord into the charm of more or less
convent beauti he feel himself often insult toss
about like a tenni ball over the net between the two parti of
the outer and the inner beauti to those who ar not accustom
to it the inner beauti appear as ugli becaus human in
gener inclin to the outer and know noth of the inner
almost alon in sever himself from convent beauti is the
austrian compos arnold schonberg he sai in hi
harmonielehr everi combin of note everi advanc is
possibl but i am begin to feel that there ar also definit
rule and condit which inclin me to the us of thi or that
disson footnot die musik p 104 from the
harmonielehr verlag der univers edit thi mean that
schonberg realiz that the greatest freedom of all the freedom
of an unfett art can never be absolut everi ag achiev a
certain measur of thi freedom but beyond the boundari of it
freedom the mightiest geniu can never go but the measur of
freedom of each ag must be constantli enlarg schonberg is
endeavour to make complet us of hi freedom and ha alreadi
discov gold mine of new beauti in hi search for spiritu
harmoni hi music lead us into a realm where music experi
is a matter not of the ear but of the soul aloneand from thi
point begin the music of the futur
a parallel cours ha been follow by the impressionist movement
in paint it is seen in it dogmat and most naturalist
form in socal neoimpression the theori of thi is to put
on the canva the whole glitter and brillianc of natur and not
onli an isol aspect of her
it is interest to notic three practic contemporari and
total differ group in paint thei ar 1 rossetti and
hi pupil burnejon with their follow 2 bocklin and hi
school 3 segantini with hi unworthi follow of
photograph artist i have chosen these three group to
illustr the search for the abstract in art rossetti sought to
reviv the nonmateri of the preraphaelit bocklin busi
himself with the mytholog scene but wa in contrast to
rossetti in that he gave strongli materi form to hi legendari
figur segantini outwardli the most materi of the three
select the most ordinari object hill stone cattl etc
often paint them with the minutest realism but he never
fail to creat a spiritu as well as a materi valu so that
realli he is the most nonmateri of the trio
these men sought for the inner by wai of the outer
by anoth road and on more pure artist the great seeker
after a new sens of form approach the same problem cezann
made a live thing out of a teacup or rather in a teacup he
realiz the exist of someth aliv he rais still life
to such a point that it ceas to be inanim
he paint these thing as he paint human be becaus he
wa endow with the gift of divin the inner life in
everyth hi colour and form ar alik suitabl to the
spiritu harmoni a man a tree an appl all were us by
cezann in the creation of someth that is call a pictur
and which is a piec of true inward and artist harmoni the
same intent actuat the work of on of the greatest of the
young frenchmen henri matiss he paint pictur and in
these pictur endeavour to reproduc the divinefootnot
cf hi articl in kunst und kunstler 1909 no 8 to attain
thi end he requir as a start point noth but the object
to be paint human be or whatev it mai be and then the
method that belong to paint alon colour and form
by person inclin becaus he is french and becaus he is
special gift as a colourist matiss is apt to lai too much
stress on the colour like debussi he cannot alwai refrain from
convent beauti impression is in hi blood on see
pictur of matiss which ar full of great inward vital
produc by the stress of the inner need and also pictur which
possess onli outer charm becaus thei were paint on an outer
impuls how often on is remind of manet in thi hi work
seem to be typic french paint with it dainti sens of
melodi rais from time to time to the summit of a great hill
abov the cloud
but in the work of anoth great artist in pari the spaniard pablo
picasso there is never ani suspicion of thi convent beauti
toss hither and thither by the need for selfexpress picasso
hurri from on manner to anoth at time a great gulf appear
between consecut manner becaus picasso leap boldli and is found
continu by hi bewild crowd of follow stand at a point
veri differ from that at which thei saw him last no sooner do thei
think that thei have reach him again than he ha chang onc more in
thi wai there aros cubism the latest of the french movement which
is treat in detail in part ii picasso is try to arriv at
construct by wai of proport in hi latest work 1911 he ha
achiev the logic destruct of matter not howev by dissolut
but rather by a kind of a parcel out of it variou divis and a
construct scatter of these divis about the canva but he
seem in thi most recent work distinctli desir of keep an
appear of matter he shrink from no innov and if colour seem
like to balk him in hi search for a pure artist form he throw it
overboard and paint a pictur in brown and white and the problem of
pure artist form is the real problem of hi life
in their pursuit of the same suprem end matiss and picasso
stand side by side matiss repres colour and picasso form
iv the pyramid
and so at differ point along the road ar the differ art
sai what thei ar best abl to sai and in the languag which
is peculiarli their own despit or perhap thank to the
differ between them there ha never been a time when the
art approach each other more nearli than thei do todai in
thi later phase of spiritu develop
in each manifest is the seed of a strive toward the
abstract the nonmateri conscious or unconsci thei ar
obei socrat commandknow thyself conscious or
unconsci artist ar studi and prove their materi
set in the balanc the spiritu valu of those element
with which it is their sever privileg to work
and the natur result of thi strive is that the variou art
ar draw togeth thei ar find in music the best teacher
with few except music ha been for some centuri the art
which ha devot itself not to the reproduct of natur
phenomena but rather to the express of the artist soul in
music sound
a painter who find no satisfact in mere represent
howev artist in hi long to express hi inner life
cannot but envi the eas with which music the most nonmateri
of the art todai achiev thi end he natur seek to appli
the method of music to hi own art and from thi result that
modern desir for rhythm in paint for mathemat abstract
construct for repeat note of colour for set colour in
motion
thi borrow of method by on art from anoth can onli be
truli success when the applic of the borrow method is
not superfici but fundament on art must learn first how
anoth us it method so that the method mai afterward be
appli to the borrow art from the begin and suitabl
the artist must not forget that in him li the power of true
applic of everi method but that that power must be
develop
in manipul of form music can achiev result which ar
beyond the reach of paint on the other hand paint is
ahead of music in sever particular music for exampl ha at
it dispos durat of time while paint can present to the
spectat the whole content of it messag at on moment
footnot these statement of differ ar of cours
rel for music can on occas dispens with extens of
time and paint make us of it music which is outwardli
unfett by natur need no definit form for it express
footnot how miser music fail when attempt to express
materi appear is prove by the affect absurd of
programm music quit late such experi have been made
the imit in sound of croak frog of farmyard nois of
household duti make an excel music hall turn and is
amus enough but in seriou music such attempt ar mere
warn against ani imit of natur natur ha her own
languag and a power on thi languag cannot be imit
the sound of a farmyard in music is never successfulli
reproduc and is unnecessari wast of time the stimmung of
natur can be impart by everi art not howev by imit
but by the artist divin of it inner spirit
paint todai is almost exclus concern with the
reproduct of natur form and phenomena her busi is now
to test her strength and method to know herself as music ha
done for a long time and then to us her power to a truli
artist end
and so the art ar encroach on upon anoth and from a
proper us of thi encroach will rise the art that is truli
monument everi man who steep himself in the spiritu
possibl of hi art is a valuabl helper in the build of
the spiritu pyramid which will some dai reach to heaven

dai longer is essenti to warmth cook playact from
the mass of these discoveri is compos a knowledg of light
which is indel fix in hi mind the strong intens
interest disappear and the variou properti of flame ar
balanc against each other in thi wai the whole world becom
gradual disench it is realiz that tree give shade
that hors run fast and motorcar still faster that dog bite
that the figur seen in a mirror is not a real human be
as the man develop the circl of these experi caus by
differ be and object grow ever wider thei acquir an
inner mean and eventu a spiritu harmoni it is the same
with colour which make onli a momentari and superfici
impress on a soul but slightli develop in sensit but
even thi superfici impress vari in qualiti the ey is
strongli attract by light clear colour and still more
strongli attract by those colour which ar warm as well as
clear vermilion ha the charm of flame which ha alwai
attract human be keen lemonyellow hurt the ey in time
as a prolong and shrill trumpetnot the ear and the gazer
turn awai to seek relief in blue or green
but to a more sensit soul the effect of colour is deeper and
intens move and so we come to the second main result of
look at colour their psychic effect thei produc a
correspond spiritu vibrat and it is onli as a step
toward thi spiritu vibrat that the elementari physic
impress is of import
whether the psychic effect of colour is a direct on as these last few
line impli or whether it is the outcom of associ is perhap
open to question the soul be on with the bodi the former mai well
experi a psychic shock caus by associ act on the latter
for exampl red mai caus a sensat analog to that caus by
flame becaus red is the colour of flame a warm red will prove
excit anoth shade of red will caus pain or disgust through
associ with run blood in these case colour awaken a
correspond physic sensat which undoubtedli work upon the soul
if thi were alwai the case it would be easi to defin by
associ the effect of colour upon other sens than that of
sight on might sai that keen yellow look sour becaus it
recal the tast of a lemon
but such definit ar not univers possibl there ar mani
exampl of colour work which refus to be so classifi a

sai that here also no rule can be laid down but cf l
sabanejeff in musik moscow 1911 no 9 where the immin
possibl of lai down a law is clearli hint at it would
be possibl to suggest by wai of explan of thi that in
highli sensit peopl the wai to the soul is so direct and the
soul itself so impression that ani impress of tast
commun itself immedi to the soul and thenc to the
other organ of sens in thi case the ey thi would impli
an echo or reverber such as occur sometim in music
instrument which without be touch sound in harmoni with
some other instrument struck at the moment
but not onli with tast ha sight been known to work in harmoni
mani colour have been describ as rough or sticki other as
smooth and uniform so that on feel inclin to stroke them
eg dark ultramarin chromic oxid green and rose madder
equal the distinct between warm and cold colour belong to
thi connect some colour appear soft rose madder other
hard cobalt green bluegreen oxid so that even fresh from
the tube thei seem to be dry
the express scent colour is frequent met with and
final the sound of colour is so definit that it would be hard
to find anyon who would try to express bright yellow in the bass
note or dark lake in the trebl
footnot much theori and practic have been devot to thi
question peopl have sought to paint in counterpoint also
unmus children have been successfulli help to plai the
piano by quot a parallel in colour eg of flower on

be heard and sound seen the system ha prove success for
sever year both in the inventor own school and the
conservatoir at st petersburg final scriabin on more
spiritu line ha parallel sound and colour in a chart not
unlik that of frau unkowski in prometheu he ha given

footnot the convers question ie the colour of sound wa
touch upon by mallarm and systemat by hi discipl rene

the explan by associ will not suffic us in mani and
the most import case those who have heard of chromotherapi
will know that colour light can exercis veri definit
influenc on the whole bodi attempt have been made with
differ colour in the treatment of variou nervou ailment
thei have shown that red light stimul and excit the heart
while blue light can caus temporari paralysi but when the
experi come to be tri on anim and even plant the
associ theori fall to the ground so on is bound to admit
that the question is at present unexplor but that colour can
exercis enorm influenc over the bodi as a physic organ
no more suffici in the psychic sphere is the theori of
associ gener speak colour is a power which directli
influenc the soul colour is the keyboard the ey ar the
hammer the soul is the piano with mani string the artist is
the hand which plai touch on kei or anoth to caus
vibrat in the soul
it is evid therefor that colour harmoni must rest onli on a
correspond vibrat in the human soul and thi is on of the
guid principl of the inner need
footnot the phrase inner need inner notwendigkeit mean
primarili the impuls felt by the artist for spiritu
express kandinski is apt howev to us the phrase
sometim to mean not onli the hunger for spiritu express
but also the actual express itselfmth

these two quotat show the deep relationship between the art
and especi between music and paint goeth said that
paint must count thi relationship her main foundat and by
thi prophet remark he seem to foretel the posit in which
paint is todai she stand in fact at the first stage of the
road by which she will accord to her own possibl make
art an abstract of thought and arriv final at pure
artist composit footnot by komposit kandinski here
mean of cours an artist creation he is not refer to
the arrang of the object in a picturemth
paint ha two weapon at her dispos
1 colour
2 form
form can stand alon as repres an object either real or
otherwis or as a pure abstract limit to a space or a surfac
colour cannot stand alon it cannot dispens with boundari of some
kind footnot cf a wallac rimington colour music op cit where
experi ar recount with a colour organ which give symphoni of
rapidli chang colour without boundariesexcept the unavoid on
of the white curtain on which the colour ar reflectedmth a
neverend extent of red can onli be seen in the mind when the word
red is heard the colour is evok without definit boundari if such
ar necessari thei have deliber to be imagin but such red as is
seen by the mind and not by the ey exercis at onc a definit and an
indefinit impress on the soul and produc spiritu harmoni i sai
indefinit becaus in itself it ha no suggest of warmth or cold
such attribut have to be imagin for it afterward as
modif of the origin red i sai definit becaus the
spiritu harmoni exist without ani need for such subsequ attribut
of warmth or cold an analog case is the sound of a trumpet which on
hear when the word trumpet is pronounc thi sound is audibl to
the soul without the distinct charact of a trumpet heard in the
open air or in a room plai alon or with other instrument in the
hand of a postilion a huntsman a soldier or a profession musician
but when red is present in a materi form as in paint it
must possess 1 some definit shade of the mani shade of red
that exist and 2 a limit surfac divid off from the other
colour which ar undoubtedli there the first of these
condit the subject is affect by the second the
object for the neighbour colour affect the shade of red
thi essenti connect between colour and form bring us to
the question of the influenc of form on colour form alon
even though total abstract and geometr ha a power of
inner suggest a triangl without the accessori consider
of it be acuteor obtuseangl or equilater ha a
spiritu valu of it own in connect with other form thi
valu mai be somewhat modifi but remain in qualiti the same
the case is similar with a circl a squar or ani conceiv
geometr figur footnot the angl at which the triangl
stand and whether it is stationari or move ar of import
to it spiritu valu thi fact is special worthi of the
painter consider as abov with the red we have here a
subject substanc in an object shell
the mutual influenc of form and colour now becom clear a
yellow triangl a blue circl a green squar or a green
triangl a yellow circl a blue squareal these ar differ
and have differ spiritu valu
it is evid that mani colour ar hamper and even nullifi
in effect by mani form on the whole keen colour ar well
suit by sharp form eg a yellow triangl and soft deep
colour by round form eg a blue circl but it must be
rememb that an unsuit combin of form and colour is
not necessarili discord but mai with manipul show the
wai to fresh possibl of harmoni
sinc colour and form ar wellnigh innumer their
combin and their influenc ar likewis unend the
materi is inexhaust
form in the narrow sens is noth but the separ line
between surfac of colour that is it outer mean but it ha
also an inner mean of vari intens footnot it is
never liter true that ani form is meaningless and sai
noth everi form in the world sai someth but it messag
often fail to reach us and even if it doe full understand
is often withheld from us and properli speak form is the
outward express of thi inner mean to us onc more the
metaphor of the pianoth artist is the hand which by plai
on thi or that kei ie form affect the human soul in thi
or that wai so it is evid that formharmoni must rest onli on
a correspond vibrat of the human soul and thi is a second
guid principl of the inner need
the two aspect of form just mention defin it two aim the
task of limit surfac the outer aspect is well perform if
the inner mean is fulli express
footnot the phrase full express must be clearli
understood form often is most express when least coher it
is often most express when outwardli most imperfect perhap
onli a stroke a mere hint of outer mean
the outer task mai assum mani differ shape but it will
never fail in on of two purpos 1 either form aim at so
limit surfac as to fashion of them some materi object 2
or form remain abstract describ onli a nonmateri
spiritu entiti such nonmateri entiti with life and valu
as such ar a circl a triangl a rhombu a trapez etc
mani of them so complic as to have no mathemat
denomin
between these two extrem lie the innumer form in which
both element exist with a preponder either of the abstract
or the materi these intermedi form ar at present the
store on which the artist ha to draw pure abstract form ar
beyond the reach of the artist at present thei ar too
indefinit for him to limit himself to the pure indefinit
would be to rob himself of possibl to exclud the human
element and therefor to weaken hi power of express
on the other hand there exist equal no pure materi form
a materi object cannot be absolut reproduc for good or
evil the artist ha ey and hand which ar perhap more
artist than hi intent and refus to aim at photographi
alon mani genuin artist who cannot be content with a mere
inventori of materi object seek to express the object by
what wa onc call ideal then select and which
tomorrow will again be call someth differ
footnot the motiv of ideal is so to beautifi the organ form
as to bring out it harmoni and rous poetic feel select aim
not so much at beautif as at emphas the charact of the
object by the omiss of nonessenti the desir of the futur will
be pure the express of the inner mean the organ form no
longer serv as direct object but as the human word in which a divin
messag must be written in order for it to be comprehens to human
mind
the imposs and in art the useless of attempt to
copi an object exactli the desir to give the object full
express ar the impuls which drive the artist awai from
liter colour to pure artist aim and that bring us
to the question of composit footnot here kandinski mean
arrang of the picturemth
pure artist composit ha two element
1 the composit of the whole pictur
2 the creation of the variou form which by stand in
differ relationship to each other decid the composit of
the whole footnot the gener composit will natur
includ mani littl composit which mai be antagonist to
each other though helpingperhap by their veri antagonismth
harmoni of the whole these littl composit have themselv
subdivis of vari inner mean mani object have to be
consid in the light of the whole and so order as to suit
thi whole singli thei will have littl mean be of
import onli in so far as thei help the gener effect these
singl object must be fashion in on wai onli and thi not
becaus their own inner mean demand that particular
fashion but entir becaus thei have to serv as build
materi for the whole composit footnot a good exampl is
cezann bath women which is built in the form of a
triangl such build is an old principl which wa be
abandon onli becaus academ usag had made it lifeless but
cezann ha given it new life he doe not us it to harmon
hi group but for pure artist purpos he distort the
human figur with perfect justif not onli must the whole
figur follow the line of the triangl but each limb must grow
narrow from bottom to top raphael holi famili is an
exampl of triangular composit us onli for the harmon
of the group and without ani mystic motiv
so the abstract idea is creep into art although onli
yesterdai it wa scorn and obscur by pure materi ideal
it gradual advanc is natur enough for in proport as the
organ form fall into the background the abstract ideal
achiev greater promin
but the organ form possess all the same an inner harmoni of
it own which mai be either the same as that of it abstract
parallel thu produc a simpl combin of the two
element or total differ in which case the combin mai
be unavoid discord howev diminish in import the
organ form mai be it inner note will alwai be heard and for
thi reason the choic of materi object is an import on
the spiritu accord of the organ with the abstract element mai
strengthen the appeal of the latter as much by contrast as by
similar or mai destroi it
suppos a rhomboid composit made up of a number of human
figur the artist ask himself ar these human figur an
absolut necess to the composit or should thei be replac
by other form and that without affect the fundament
harmoni of the whole if the answer is ye we have a case in
which the materi appeal directli weaken the abstract appeal
the human form must either be replac by anoth object which
whether by similar or contrast will strengthen the abstract
appeal or must remain a pure nonmateri symbol footnot
cf translat introduct pp xviii and xxmth
onc more the metaphor of the piano for colour or form
substitut object everi object ha it own life and therefor
it own appeal man is continu subject to these appeal but
the result ar often dub either subor superconsci
natur that is to sai the everchang surround of man
set in vibrat the string of the piano the soul by
manipul of the kei the variou object with their sever
appeal
the impress we receiv which often appear mere chaotic
consist of three element the impress of the colour of the
object of it form and of it combin colour and form ie of
the object itself
at thi point the individu of the artist come to the front
and dispos as he will these three element it is clear
therefor that the choic of object ie of on of the element
in the harmoni of form must be decid onli by a correspond
vibrat in the human soul and thi is a third guid
principl of the inner need
the more abstract is form the more clear and direct is it
appeal in ani composit the materi side mai be more or less
omit in proport as the form us ar more or less
materi and for them substitut pure abstract or larg
demateri object the more an artist us these abstract
form the deeper and more confid will he advanc into the
kingdom of the abstract and after him will follow the gazer at
hi pictur who also will have gradual acquir a greater
familiar with the languag of that kingdom
must we then abandon utterli all materi object and paint
sole in abstract the problem of harmon the appeal of
the materi and the nonmateri show us the answer to thi
question as everi word spoken rous an inner vibrat so
likewis doe everi object repres to depriv oneself of
thi possibl is to limit on power of express that is
at ani rate the case at present but besid thi answer to the
question there is anoth and on which art can alwai emploi
to ani question begin with must there is no must in art
becaus art is free
with regard to the second problem of composit the creation of
the singl element which ar to compos the whole it must be
rememb that the same form in the same circumst will
alwai have the same inner appeal onli the circumst ar
constantli vari it result that 1 the ideal harmoni alter
accord to the relat to other form of the form which caus
it 2 even in similar relationship a slight approach to or
withdraw from other form mai affect the harmoni footnot
thi is what is meant by an appeal of motion for exampl the
appeal of an upright triangl is more steadfast and quiet than
that of on set obliqu on it side noth is absolut
formcomposit rest on a rel basi depend on 1 the
alter in the mutual relat of form on to anoth 2
alter in each individu form down to the veri smallest
everi form is as sensit as a puff of smoke the slightest
breath will alter it complet thi extrem mobil make it
easier to obtain similar harmoni from the us of differ
form than from a repetit of the same on though of cours
an exact replica of a spiritu harmoni can never be produc so
long as we ar suscept onli to the appeal of a whole
composit thi fact is of mainli theoret import but
when we becom more sensit by a constant us of abstract form
which have no materi interpret it will becom of great
practic signific and so as art becom more difficult it
wealth of express in form becom greater and greater at the
same time the question of distort in draw fall out and is
replac by the question how far the inner appeal of the
particular form is veil or given full express and onc more
the possibl ar extend for combin of veil and
fulli express appeal suggest new leitmotiven in composit
without such develop as thi formcomposit is imposs
to anyon who cannot experi the inner appeal of form whether
materi or abstract such composit can never be other than
meaningless appar aimless alter in formarrang
will make art seem mere a game so onc more we ar face with
the same principl which is to set art free the principl of
the inner need
when featur or limb for artist reason ar chang or
distort men reject the artist problem and fall back on the
secondari question of anatomi but on our argument thi
secondari consider doe not appear onli the real artist
question remain these appar irrespons but realli
wellreason alter in form provid on of the storehous
of artist possibl
the adapt of form their organ but inward variat
their motion in the pictur their inclin to materi or
abstract their mutual relat either individu or as part
of a whole further the concord or discord of the variou
element of a pictur the handl of group the combin
of veil and openli express appeal the us of rhythmic or
unrhythm of geometr or nongeometr form their
contigu or separational these thing ar the materi for
counterpoint in paint
but so long as colour is exclud such counterpoint is confin
to black and white colour provid a whole wealth of
possibl of her own and when combin with form yet a
further seri of possibl and all these will be
express of the inner need
the inner need is built up of three mystic element 1 everi
artist as a creator ha someth in him which call for
express thi is the element of person 2 everi
artist as child of hi ag is impel to express the spirit of
hi ag thi is the element of styledict by the period
and particular countri to which the artist belong it is
doubt how long the latter distinct will continu to exist
3 everi artist as a servant of art ha to help the caus of
art thi is the element of pure artistri which is constant in
all ag and among all nation
a full understand of the first two element is necessari for a
realiz of the third but he who ha thi realiz will
recogn that a rude carv indian column is an express of
the same spirit as actuat ani real work of art of todai
in the past and even todai much talk is heard of person in
art talk of the come style becom more frequent daili but
for all their import todai these question will have
disappear after a few hundr or thousand year
onli the third elementthat of pure artistrywil remain for
ever an egyptian carv speak to us todai more subtli than it
did to it chronolog contemporari for thei judg it with
the hamper knowledg of period and person but we can
judg pure as an express of the etern artistri
similarlyth greater the part plai in a modern work of art by
the two element of style and person the better will it be
appreci by peopl todai but a modern work of art which is
full of the third element will fail to reach the contemporari
soul for mani centuri have to pass awai befor the third
element can be receiv with understand but the artist in
whose work thi third element predomin is the realli great
artist
becaus the element of style and person make up what is
call the period characterist of ani work of art the
develop of artist form must depend on their separ
from the element of pure artistri which know neither period nor
nation but as style and person creat in everi epoch
certain definit form which for all their superfici
differ ar realli close relat these form can be
spoken of as on side of artth subject everi artist
choos from the form which reflect hi own time those which
ar sympathet to him and express himself through them so
the subject element is the definit and extern express of
the inner object element
the inevit desir for outward express of the object
element is the impuls here defin as the inner need the
form it borrow chang from dai to dai and as it continu
advanc what is todai a phrase of inner harmoni becom
tomorrow on of outer harmoni it is clear therefor that the
inner spirit of art onli us the outer form of ani particular
period as a steppingston to further express
in short the work of the inner need and the develop of
art is an everadvanc express of the etern and object
in the term of the period and subject
becaus the object is forev exchang the subject
express of todai for that of tomorrow each new extens of
liberti in the us of outer form is hail as the last and
suprem at present we sai that an artist can us ani form he
wish so long as he remain in touch with natur but thi
limit like all it predecessor is onli temporari from
the point of view of the inner need no limit must be made
the artist mai us ani form which hi express demand for hi
inner impuls must find suitabl outward express
so we see that a deliber search for person and style is
not onli imposs but compar unimport the close
relationship of art throughout the ag is not a relationship in
outward form but in inner mean and therefor the talk of
school of line of develop of principl of art etc
is base on misunderstand and can onli lead to confus
the artist must be blind to distinct between recogn or
unrecogn convent of form deaf to the transitori
teach and demand of hi particular ag he must watch onli
the trend of the inner need and hearken to it word alon then
he will with safeti emploi mean both sanction and forbidden by
hi contemporari all mean ar sacr which ar call for by
the inner need all mean ar sin which obscur that inner
need
it is imposs to theoriz about thi ideal of art in real art
theori doe not preced practic but follow her everyth is
at first a matter of feel ani theoret scheme will be
lack in the essenti of creationth inner desir for
expressionwhich cannot be determin neither the qualiti of
the inner need nor it subject form can be measur nor
weigh

such a grammar of paint can onli be temporarili guess at
and should it ever be achiev it will be not so much accord
to physic rule which have so often been tri and which todai
the cubist ar try as accord to the rule of the inner
need which ar of the soul
the inner need is the basic alik of small and great problem in
paint we ar seek todai for the road which is to lead us
awai from the outer to the inner basi
footnot the term outer here us must not be confus with
the term materi us previous i am us the former to
mean outer need which never goe beyond convent limit
nor produc other than convent beauti the inner need
know no such limit and often produc result convention
consid ugli but ugli itself is a convent term and
onli mean spiritu unsympathet be appli to some
express of an inner need either outgrown or not yet attain
but everyth which adequ express the inner need is
beauti
the spirit like the bodi can be strengthen and develop by
frequent exercis just as the bodi if neglect grow weaker
and final impot so the spirit perish if untend and for
thi reason it is necessari for the artist to know the start
point for the exercis of hi spirit
the start point is the studi of colour and it effect on men
there is no need to engag in the finer shade of complic
colour but rather at first to consid onli the direct us of
simpl colour
to begin with let us test the work on ourselv of individu
colour and so make a simpl chart which will facilit the
consider of the whole question
two great divis of colour occur to the mind at the outset
into warm and cold and into light and dark to each colour there
ar therefor four shade of appealwarm and light or warm and
dark or cold and light or cold and dark
gener speak warmth or cold in a colour mean an approach
respect to yellow or to blue thi distinct is so to
speak on on basi the colour have a constant fundament
appeal but assum either a more materi or more nonmateri
qualiti the movement is an horizont on the warm colour
approach the spectat the cold on retreat from him
the colour which caus in anoth colour thi horizont
movement while thei ar themselv affect by it have anoth
movement of their own which act with a violent separ
forc thi is therefor the first antithesi in the inner
appeal and the inclin of the colour to yellow or to blue
is of tremend import
the second antithesi is between white and black ie the
inclin to light or dark caus by the pair of colour just
mention these colour have onc more their peculiar movement
to and from the spectat but in a more rigid form see fig 1
figur i

possibl for the white black of possibl for the
futur birth futur death
ii exand concentr as in case of yellow and blue but
more rigid
yellow and blue have anoth movement which affect the first
antithesisan exand concentr movement if two circl ar
drawn and paint respect yellow and blue brief
concentr will reveal in the yellow a spread movement out
from the centr and a notic approach to the spectat the
blue on the other hand move in upon itself like a snail
retreat into it shell and draw awai from the spectat
footnot these statement have no scientif basi but ar
found pure on spiritu experi
in the case of light and dark colour the movement is emphas
that of the yellow increas with an admixtur of white ie as
it becom lighter that of the blue increas with an admixtur
of black ie as it becom darker thi mean that there can
never be a darkcolour yellow the relationship between white
and yellow is as close as between black and blue for blue can be
so dark as to border on black besid thi physic
relationship is also a spiritu on between yellow and white
on on side between blue and black on the other which mark a
strong separ between the two pair
an attempt to make yellow colder produc a green tint and check
both the horizont and excentr movement the colour becom
sickli and unreal the blue by it contrari movement act as a
brake on the yellow and is hinder in it own movement till
the two togeth becom stationari and the result is green
similarli a mixtur of black and white produc grai which is
motionless and spiritu veri similar to green
but while green yellow and blue ar potenti activ though
temporarili paralys in grai there is no possibl of
movement becaus grai consist of two colour that have no
activ forc for thei stand the on in motionless discord the
other in a motionless negat even of discord like an endless
wall or a bottomless pit
becaus the compon colour of green ar activ and have a
movement of their own it is possibl on the basi of thi
movement to reckon their spiritu appeal
the first movement of yellow that of approach to the spectat
which can be increas by an intensif of the yellow and
also the second movement that of overspread the boundari
have a materi parallel in the human energi which assail everi
obstacl blindli and burst forth aimlessli in everi direct
yellow if steadili gaze at in ani geometr form ha a
disturb influenc and reveal in the colour an insist
aggress charact footnot it is worth note that the
sourtast lemon and shrillsing canari ar both yellow
the intensif of the yellow increas the pain
shrill of it note
footnot ani parallel between colour and music can onli be
rel just as a violin can give variou shade of toneso
yellow ha shade which can be express by variou instrument
but in make such parallel i am assum in each case a pure
tone of colour or sound unvari by vibrat or damper etc
yellow is the typic earthli colour it can never have
profound mean an intermixtur of blue make it a sickli
colour it mai be parallel in human natur with mad not
with melancholi or hypochondriac mania but rather with violent
rave lunaci
the power of profound mean is found in blue and first in it
physic movement 1 of retreat from the spectat 2 of
turn in upon it own centr the inclin of blue to depth
is so strong that it inner appeal is stronger when it shade is
deeper
blue is the typic heavenli colour

the ultim feel it creat is on of rest
footnot supernatur rest not the earthli content of
green the wai to the supernatur li through the natur and
we mortal pass from the earthli yellow to the heavenli blue
must pass through green
when it sink almost to black it echo a grief that is hardli
human
footnot as an echo of grief violet stand to blue as doe green
in it product of rest
when it rise toward white a movement littl suit to it it
appeal to men grow weaker and more distant in music a light
blue is like a flute a darker blue a cello a still darker a
thunder doubl bass and the darkest blue of allan organ
a wellbalanc mixtur of blue and yellow produc green the
horizont movement ceas likewis that from and toward the
centr the effect on the soul through the ey is therefor
motionless thi is a fact recogn not onli by optician but
by the world green is the most rest colour that exist on
exhaust men thi rest ha a benefici effect but after
a time it becom wearisom pictur paint in shade of green
ar passiv and tend to be wearisom thi contrast with the
activ warmth of yellow or the activ cool of blue in the
hierarchi of colour green is the bourgeoisieselfsatisfi
immov narrow it is the colour of summer the period when
natur is rest from the storm of winter and the product
energi of spring cf fig 2
ani preponder in green of yellow or blue introduc a
correspond activ and chang the inner appeal the green
keep it characterist equanim and rest the former
increas with the inclin to light the latter with the
inclin to depth in music the absolut green is repres
by the placid middl note of a violin
black and white have alreadi been discuss in gener term
more particularli speak white although often consid as
no colour a theori larg due to the impressionist who saw no
white in natur as a symbol of a world from which all colour as a
definit attribut ha disappear
footnot van gogh in hi letter ask whether he mai not
paint a white wall dead white thi question offer no difficulti
to the nonrepres artist who is concern onli with the
inner harmoni of colour but to the impressionistrealist it
seem a bold liberti to take with natur to him it seem as
outrag as hi own chang from brown shadow to blue seem to
hi contemporari van gogh question mark a transit from
impression to an art of spiritu harmoni as the come of
the blue shadow mark a transit from academ to
impression cf the letter of vincent van gogh constabl
london
thi world is too far abov us for it harmoni to touch our
soul a great silenc like an impenetr wall shroud it
life from our understand white therefor ha thi harmoni
of silenc which work upon us neg like mani paus in
music that break temporarili the melodi it is not a dead
silenc but on pregnant with possibl white ha the
appeal of the nothing that is befor birth of the world in
the ic ag
a total dead silenc on the other hand a silenc with no
possibl ha the inner harmoni of black in music it is
repres by on of those profound and final paus after
which ani continu of the melodi seem the dawn of anoth
world black is someth burnt out like the ash of a funer
pyre someth motionless like a corps the silenc of black is
the silenc of death outwardli black is the colour with least
harmoni of all a kind of neutral background against which the
minutest shade of other colour stand clearli forward it
differ from white in thi also for with white nearli everi
colour is in discord or even mute altogeth
footnot eg vermilion ring dull and muddi against white but
against black with clear strength light yellow against white is
weak against black pure and brilliant
not without reason is white taken as symbol joi and spotless
puriti and black grief and death a blend of black and white
produc grai which as ha been said is silent and motionless
be compos of two inact colour it rest have
none of the potenti activ of green a similar grai is
produc by a mixtur of green and red a spiritu blend of
passiv and glow warmth
footnot grai immobl and rest delacroix sought to
express rest by a mixtur of green and red cf signac sup
cit
the unbound warmth of red ha not the irrespons appeal of
yellow but ring inwardli with a determin and power
intens it glow in itself matur and doe not distribut
it vigour aimlessli see fig 2
the vari power of red ar veri strike by a skill us of
it in it differ shade it fundament tone mai be made warm
or cold
footnot of cours everi colour can be to some extent vari
between warm and cold but no colour ha so extens a scale of
varieti as red
light warm red ha a certain similar to medium yellow alik
in textur and appeal and give a feel of strength vigour
determin triumph in music it is a sound of trumpet
strong harsh and ring
vermilion is a red with a feel of sharp like glow
steel which can be cool by water vermilion is quench by
blue for it can support no mixtur with a cold colour more
accur speak such a mixtur produc what is call a
dirti colour scorn by painter of todai but dirt as a
materi object ha it own inner appeal and therefor to avoid
it in paint is as unjust and narrow as wa the cry of
yesterdai for pure colour at the call of the inner need that
which is outwardli foul mai be inwardli pure and vice versa
the two shade of red just discuss ar similar to yellow
except that thei reach out less to the spectat the glow of red
is within itself for thi reason it is a colour more belov
than yellow be frequent us in primit and tradit
decor and also in peasant costum becaus in the open air
the harmoni of red and green is veri beauti taken by itself
thi red is materi and like yellow ha no veri deep appeal
onli when combin with someth nobler doe it acquir thi
deep appeal it is danger to seek to deepen red by an
admixtur of black for black quench the glow or at least
reduc it consider
but there remain brown unemot disinclin for movement
an intermixtur of red is outwardli bare audibl but there
ring out a power inner harmoni skill blend can produc
an inner appeal of extraordinari indescrib beauti the
vermilion now ring like a great trumpet or thunder like a
drum
cool red madder like ani other fundament cold colour can
be deepenedespeci by an intermixtur of azur the
charact of the colour chang the inward glow increas the
activ element gradual disappear but thi activ element is
never so wholli absent as in deep green there alwai remain a
hint of renew vigour somewher out of sight wait for a
certain moment to burst forth afresh in thi li the great
differ between a deepen red and a deepen blue becaus in
red there is alwai a trace of the materi a parallel in music
ar the sad middl tone of a cello a cold light red contain
a veri distinct bodili or materi element but it is alwai
pure like the fresh beauti of the face of a young girl the
sing note of a violin express thi exactli in music
warm red intensifi by a suitabl yellow is orang thi blend
bring red almost to the point of spread out toward the
spectat but the element of red is alwai suffici strong
to keep the colour from flippanc orang is like a man
convinc of hi own power it note is that of the angelu or
of an old violin
just as orang is red brought nearer to human by yellow so
violet is red withdrawn from human by blue but the red in
violet must be cold for the spiritu need doe not allow of a
mixtur of warm red with cold blue
violet is therefor both in the physic and spiritu sens a
cool red it is consequ rather sad and ail it is worn
by old women and in china as a sign of mourn in music it is
an english horn or the deep note of wood instrument eg a
bassoon
footnot among artist on often hear the question how ar
you answer gloomili by the word feel veri violet
the two last mention colour orang and violet ar the fourth
and last pair of antithes of the primit colour thei stand
to each other in the same relat as the third antithesesgreen

the antithes as a circl between two pole ie the life of
colour between birth and death
the capit letter design the pair of antithes
it is clear that all i have said of these simpl colour is veri
provision and gener and so also ar those feel joi
grief etc which have been quot as parallel of the colour
for these feel ar onli the materi express of the soul
shade of colour like those of sound ar of a much finer
textur and awak in the soul emot too fine to be express
in word certainli each tone will find some probabl express
in word but it will alwai be incomplet and that part which
the word fail to express will not be unimport but rather the
veri kernel of it exist for thi reason word ar and will
alwai remain onli hint mere suggest of colour in thi
imposs of express colour in word with the consequ
need for some other mode of express li the opportun of
the art of the futur in thi art among innumer rich and
vari combin there is on which is found on firm fact
and that is as follow the actual express of colour can be
achiev simultan by sever form of art each art plai
it separ part and produc a whole which exce in
rich and forc ani express attain by on art alon
the immens possibl of depth and strength to be gain by
combin or by discord between the variou art can be easili
realiz
it is often said that admiss of the possibl of on art
help anoth amount to a denial of the necessari differ
between the art thi is howev not the case as ha been
said an absolut similar inner appeal cannot be achiev by
two differ art even if it were possibl the second version
would differ at least outwardli but suppos thi were not the
case that is to sai suppos a repetit of the same appeal
exactli alik both outwardli and inwardli could be achiev by
differ art such repetit would not be mere superflu
to begin with differ peopl find sympathi in differ form
of art alik on the activ and passiv side among the creator
or the receiv of the appeal but further and more import
repetit of the same appeal thicken the spiritu atmospher
which is necessari for the matur of the finest feel in
the same wai as the hot air of a greenhous is necessari for the
ripen of certain fruit an exampl of thi is the case of the
individu who receiv a power impress from constantli
repeat action thought or feel although if thei came
singli thei might have pass by unnot footnot thi idea
form of cours the fundament reason for advertis we
must not howev appli thi rule onli to the simpl exampl of
the spiritu atmospher for thi atmospher is like air which
can be either pure or fill with variou alien element not
onli visibl action thought and feel with outward
express make up thi atmospher but secret happen of
which no on know unspoken thought hidden feel ar also
element in it suicid murder violenc low and unworthi
thought hate hostil egot envi narrow patriot
partisanship ar element in the spiritu atmospher
footnot epidem of suicid or of violent warlik feel
etc ar product of thi impur atmospher
and convers selfsacrific mutual help lofti thought
love unselfish joi in the success of other human
just ar the element which slai those alreadi enumer as
the sun slai the microb and restor the atmospher to puriti
footnot these element likewis have their histor
period
the second and more complic form of repetit is that in
which sever differ element make mutual us of differ
form in our case these element ar the differ art sum
up in the art of the futur and thi form of repetit is even
more power for the differ natur of men respond to the
differ element in the combin for on the music form
is the most move and impress for anoth the pictori for
the third the literari and so on there resid therefor in
art which ar outwardli differ hidden forc equal
differ so that thei mai all work in on man toward a singl
result even though each art mai be work in isol
thi sharpli defin work of individu colour is the basi
on which variou valu can be built up in harmoni pictur will
come to be paintedverit artist arrang plan in
shade of on colour chosen accord to artist feel the
carri out of on colour the bind togeth and admixtur of
two relat colour ar the foundat of most colour
harmoni from what ha been said abov about colour work
from the fact that we live in a time of question experi
and contradict we can draw the easi conclus that for a
harmon on the basi of individu colour our ag is
especi unsuit perhap with envi and with a mourn
sympathi we listen to the music of mozart it act as a welcom
paus in the turmoil of our inner life as a consol and as a
hope but we hear it as the echo of someth from anoth ag
long past and fundament strang to us the strife of colour
the sens of balanc we have lost totter principl
unexpect assault great question appar useless
strive storm and tempest broken chain antithes and
contradict these make up our harmoni the composit
aris from thi harmoni is a mingl of colour and form each
with it separ exist but each blend into a common life
which is call a pictur by the forc of the inner need onli
these individu part ar vital everyth els such as
surround condit is subsidiari the combin of two
colour is a logic outcom of modern condit the
combin of colour hitherto consid discord is mere
a further develop for exampl the us side by side of red
and blue colour in themselv of no physic relationship but
from their veri spiritu contrast of the strongest effect is
on of the most frequent occurr in modern choic of harmoni
footnot cf gauguin noa noa where the artist state hi
disinclin when he first arriv in tahiti to juxtapos red
and blue harmoni todai rest chiefli on the principl of
contrast which ha for all time been on of the most import
principl of art but our contrast is an inner contrast which
stand alon and reject the help for that help would mean
destruct of ani other principl of harmoni it is
interest to note that thi veri place togeth of red and
blue wa so belov by the primit both in germani and itali
that it ha till todai surviv princip in folk pictur of
religi subject on often see in such pictur the virgin in
a red gown and a blue cloak it seem that the artist wish to
express the grace of heaven in term of human and human in
term of heaven legitim and illegitim combin of
colour contrast of variou colour the overpaint of on
colour with anoth the definit of colour surfac by
boundari of variou form the overstep of these
boundari the mingl and the sharp separ of surfac
all these open great vista of artist possibl
on of the first step in the turn awai from materi object
into the realm of the abstract wa to us the technic artist
term the reject of the third dimens that is to sai the
attempt to keep a pictur on a singl plane model wa
abandon in thi wai the materi object wa made more abstract
and an import step forward wa achievedthi step forward
ha howev had the effect of limit the possibl of
paint to on definit piec of canva and thi limit ha
not onli introduc a veri materi element into paint but
ha serious lessen it possibl
ani attempt to free paint from thi materi limit
togeth with the strive after a new form of composit must
concern itself first of all with the destruct of thi theori
of on singl surfaceattempt must be made to bring the pictur
on to some ideal plane which shall be express in term of the
materi plane of the canva footnot compar the articl by
le fauconni in the catalogu of the second exhibit of the
neue kunstlervereinigung munich 191011 there ha arisen out
of the composit in flat triangl a composit with plastic
threedimension triangl that is to sai with pyramid and
that is cubism but there ha arisen here also the tendenc to
inertia to a concentr on thi form for it own sake and
consequ onc more to an impoverish of possibl but
that is the unavoid result of the extern applic of an
inner principl
a further point of great import must not be forgotten there
ar other mean of us the materi plane as a space of three
dimens in order to creat an ideal plane the thin or
thick of a line the place of the form on the surfac the
overlai of on form on anoth mai be quot as exampl of
artist mean that mai be emploi similar possibl ar
offer by colour which when rightli us can advanc or
retreat and can make of the pictur a live thing and so
achiev an artist expans of space the combin of both
mean of extens in harmoni or concord is on of the richest
and most power element in pure artist composit
vii theori
from the natur of modern harmoni it result that never ha
there been a time when it wa more difficult than it is todai to
formul a complet theori footnot attempt have been made
onc more emphasi must be laid on the parallel with music for
exampl cf tendanc nouvel no 35 henri ravel the
law of harmoni ar the same for paint and music or to lai
down a firm artist basi all attempt to do so would have on
result name that alreadi cite in the case of leonardo and
hi system of littl spoon it would howev be precipit to
sai that there ar no basic principl nor firm rule in
paint or that a search for them lead inevit to
academ even music ha a grammar which although modifi
from time to time is of continu help and valu as a kind of
dictionari
paint is howev in a differ posit the revolt from
depend on natur is onli just begin ani realiz of
the inner work of colour and form is so far unconsci the
subject of composit to some geometr form is no new idea
cf the art of the persian construct on a pure abstract
basi is a slow busi and at first seemingli blind and
aimless the artist must train not onli hi ey but also hi
soul so that he can test colour for themselv and not onli by
extern impress
if we begin at onc to break the bond which bind us to natur
and devot ourselv pure to combin of pure colour and
abstract form we shall produc work which ar mere decor
which ar suit to neckti or carpet beauti of form and
colour is no suffici aim by itself despit the assert of
pure aesthet or even of naturalist who ar obsess with the
idea of beauti it is becaus of the elementari stage reach
by our paint that we ar so littl abl to grasp the inner
harmoni of true colour and form composit the nerv vibrat
ar there certainli but thei get no further than the nerv
becaus the correspond vibrat of the spirit which thei
call forth ar too weak when we rememb howev that
spiritu experi is quicken that posit scienc the
firmest basi of human thought is totter that dissolut of
matter is immin we have reason to hope that the hour of pure
composit is not far awai
it must not be thought that pure decor is lifeless it ha
it inner be but on which is either incomprehens to us
as in the case of old decor art or which seem mere
illog confus as a world in which fullgrown men and
embryo plai equal role in which be depriv of limb ar
on a level with nose and toe which live isol and of their
own vital the confus is like that of a kaleidoscop which
though possess a life of it own belong to anoth sphere
nevertheless decor ha it effect on us orient
decor quit differ to swedish savag or ancient
greek it is not for noth that there is a gener custom of
describ sampl of decor as gai seriou sad etc as
music is describ as allegro serioso etc accord to the
natur of the piec
probabl convent decor had it begin in natur
but when we would assert that extern natur is the sole sourc
of all art we must rememb that in pattern natur object
ar us as symbol almost as though thei were mere
hieroglyph for thi reason we cannot gaug their inner
harmoni for instanc we can bear a design of chines dragon in
our dine or bed room and ar no more disturb by it than by
a design of daisi
it is possibl that toward the close of our alreadi dy epoch
a new decor art will develop but it is not like to be
found on geometr form at the present time ani attempt to
defin thi new art would be as useless as pull a small bud
open so as to make a fulli blown flower nowadai we ar still
bound to extern natur and must find our mean of express in
her but how ar we to do it in other word how far mai we go
in alter the form and colour of thi natur
we mai go as far as the artist is abl to carri hi emot and
onc more we see how immens is the need for true emot a few
exampl will make the mean of thi clearer
a warm red tone will materi alter in inner valu when it is
no longer consid as an isol colour as someth
abstract but is appli as an element of some other object and
combin with natur form the varieti of natur form will
creat a varieti of spiritu valu all of which will harmon
with that of the origin isol red suppos we combin red
with sky flower a garment a face a hors a tree
a red sky suggest to us sunset or fire and ha a consequ
effect upon useith of splendour or menac much depend now
on the wai in which other object ar treat in connect with
thi red sky if the treatment is faith to natur but all the
same harmoni the naturalist appeal of the sky is
strengthen if howev the other object ar treat in a wai
which is more abstract thei tend to lessen if not to destroi
the naturalist appeal of the sky much the same appli to the
us of red in a human face in thi case red can be emploi to
emphas the passion or other characterist of the model
with a forc that onli an extrem abstract treatment of the
rest of the pictur can subdu
a red garment is quit a differ matter for it can in realiti
be of ani colour red will howev be found best to suppli the
need of pure artistri for here alon can it be us without ani
associ with materi aim the artist ha to consid not
onli the valu of the red cloak by itself but also it valu in
connect with the figur wear it and further the relat
of the figur to the whole pictur suppos the pictur to be a
sad on and the redcloak figur to be the central point on
which the sad is concentratedeith from it central
posit or featur attitud colour or what not the red
will provid an acut discord of feel which will emphas
the gloom of the pictur the us of a colour in itself sad
would weaken the effect of the dramat whole footnot onc
more it is wise to emphas the necessari inadequaci of these
exampl rule cannot be laid down the variat ar so
endless a singl line can alter the whole composit of a
pictur thi is the principl of antithesi alreadi defin
red by itself cannot have a sad effect on the spectat and it
inclus in a sad pictur will if properli handl provid the
dramat element footnot the us of term like sad and
joy ar onli clumsi equival for the delic spiritu
vibrat of the new harmoni thei must be read as necessarili
inadequ
yet again is the case of a red tree differ the fundament
valu of red remain as in everi case but the associ of
autumn creep in
the colour combin easili with thi associ and there is no
dramat clash as in the case of the red cloak
final the red hors provid a further variat the veri
word put us in anoth atmospher the imposs of a red
hors demand an unreal world it is possibl that thi
combin of colour and form will appeal as a freaka pure
superfici and nonartist appealor as a hint of a fairi
stori footnot an incomplet fairi stori work on the mind as
doe a cinematograph filmonc more a nonartist appeal to
set thi red hors in a care naturalist landscap would
creat such a discord as to produc no appeal and no coher
the need for coher is the essenti of harmonywheth
found on convent discord or concord the new harmoni
demand that the inner valu of a pictur should remain unifi
whatev the variat or contrast of outward form or colour
the element of the new art ar to be found therefor in the
inner and not the outer qualiti of natur
the spectat is too readi to look for a mean in a picturei
some outward connect between it variou part our materialist ag
ha produc a type of spectat or connoisseur who is not content to
put himself opposit a pictur and let it sai it own messag instead
of allow the inner valu of the pictur to work he worri himself
in look for close to natur or tempera or handl
or tonal or perspect or what not hi ey doe not probe the
outer express to arriv at the inner mean in a convers with
an interest person we endeavour to get at hi fundament idea and
feel we do not bother about the word he us nor the spell of
those word nor the breath necessari for speak them nor the
movement of hi tongu and lip nor the psycholog work on our
brain nor the physic sound in our ear nor the physiolog effect
on our nerv we realiz that these thing though interest and
import ar not the main thing of the moment but that the mean
and idea is what concern us we should have the same feel when
confront with a work of art when thi becom gener the artist will
be abl to dispens with natur form and colour and speak in pure
artist languag
to return to the combin of colour and form there is anoth
possibl which should be note nonnaturalist object in a
pictur mai have a literari appeal and the whole pictur mai
have the work of a fabl the spectat is put in an
atmospher which doe not disturb him becaus he accept it as
fabul and in which he tri to trace the stori and undergo
more or less the variou appeal of colour but the pure inner
work of colour is imposs the outward idea ha the masteri
still for the spectat ha onli exchang a blind realiti for a
blind dreamland where the truth of inner feel cannot be felt
we must find therefor a form of express which exclud the
fabl and yet doe not restrict the free work of colour in ani
wai the form movement and colour which we borrow from natur
must produc no outward effect nor be associ with extern
object the more obviou is the separ from natur the more
like is the inner mean to be pure and unhamp
the tendenc of a work of art mai be veri simpl but provid it
is not dictat by ani extern motiv and provid it is not
work to ani materi end the harmoni will be pure the most
ordinari actionfor exampl prepar for lift a heavi
weightbecom mysteri and dramat when it actual purpos
is not reveal we stand and gaze fascin till of a sudden
the explan burst suddenli upon us it is the convict
that noth mysteri can ever happen in our everydai life that
ha destroi the joi of abstract thought practic
consider have oust all els it is with thi fact in view
that the new danc is be evolveda that is to sai the
onli mean of give in term of time and space the real inner
mean of motion the origin of danc is probabl pure
sexual in folkdanc we still see thi element plainli the
later develop of danc as a religi ceremoni join itself
to the preced element and the two togeth take artist form
and emerg as the ballet
the ballet at the present time is in a state of chao ow to
thi doubl origin it extern motivesth express of love
and fear etcar too materi and naiv for the abstract idea
of the futur in the search for more subtl express our
modern reform have look to the past for help isadora duncan
ha forg a link between the greek danc and that of the
futur in thi she is work on parallel line to the painter
who ar look for inspir from the primit
footnot kandinski exampl of isadora duncan is not perhap
perfectli chosen thi famou dancer found her art mainli upon a
studi of greek vase and not necessarili of the primit period
her aim ar distinctli toward what kandinski call
convent beauti and what is perhap more import her
movement ar not dictat sole by the inner harmoni but
larg by consciou outward imit of greek attitud either
nijinski later ballet le sacr du printemp lapresmidi
dun faun jeux or the idea actuat the jacqu dalcroz
system of eurhythm seem to fall more into line with
kandinski artist forecast in the first case convent
beauti ha been abandon to the dismai of number of writer
and spectat and a definit return ha been made to primit
angl and abrupt in the second case motion and danc ar
brought out of the soul of the pupil truli spontan at
the call of the inner harmoni inde a comparison between
isadora duncan and m dalcroz is a comparison between the
naturalist and symbolist ideal in art which were outlin in
the introduct to thi bookmth
in danc as in paint thi is onli a stage of transit in
danc as in paint we ar on the threshold of the art of the
futur the same rule must be appli in both case
convent beauti must go by the board and the literari element
of storytel or anecdot must be abandon as useless
both art must learn from music that everi harmoni and everi
discord which spring from the inner spirit is beauti but
that it is essenti that thei should spring from the inner
spirit and from that alon
the achiev of the danceart of the futur will make possibl
the first ebullit of the art of spiritu harmonyth true
stagecomposit
the composit for the new theatr will consist of these three
element
1 music movement
2 pictori movement
3 physic movement
and these three properli combin make up the spiritu
movement which is the work of the inner harmoni thei will be
interwoven in harmoni and discord as ar the two chief element
of paint form and colour
scriabin attempt to intensifi music tone by correspond us of
colour is necessarili tent in the perfect stagecomposit the
two element ar increas by the third and endless possibl of
combin and individu us ar open up further the extern can
be combin with the intern harmoni as schonberg ha attempt in hi
quartett it is imposs here to go further into the develop of
thi idea the reader must appli the principl of paint alreadi
state to the problem of stagecomposit and outlin for himself the
possibl of the theatr of the futur found on the immov
principl of the inner need
from what ha been said of the combin of colour and form
the wai to the new art can be trace thi wai li todai between
two danger on the on hand is the total arbitrari applic
of colour to geometr formpur pattern on the other hand
is the more naturalist us of colour in bodili formpur
phantasi either of these altern mai in their turn be
exagger everyth is at the artist dispos and the
freedom of todai ha at onc it danger and it possibl
we mai be present at the concept of a new great epoch or we
mai see the opportun squander in aimless extravag
footnot on thi question see my articl uber die formfragein der
blaue reiter piperverlag 1912 take the work of henri rousseau as
a start point i go on to prove that the new natur will not onli
be equival to but even ident with abstract
that art is abov natur is no new discoveri footnot cf goeth
by karl heinemann 1899 p 684 also oscar wild de profundi also
delacroix my diari new principl do not fall from heaven but ar
logic if indirectli connect with past and futur what is
import to us is the momentari posit of the principl and how best
it can be us it must not be emploi forcibl but if the artist
tune hi soul to thi note the sound will ring in hi work of itself
the emancip of todai must advanc on the line of the inner need
it is hamper at present by extern form and as that is thrown asid
there aris as the aim of compositionconstruct the search for
construct form ha produc cubism in which natur form is often
forcibl subject to geometr construct a process which tend to
hamper the abstract by the concret and spoil the concret by the
abstract
the harmoni of the new art demand a more subtl construct
than thi someth that appeal less to the ey and more to the
soul thi conceal construct mai aris from an appar
fortuit select of form on the canva their extern lack
of cohes is their intern harmoni thi haphazard arrang
of form mai be the futur of artist harmoni their fundament
relationship will final be abl to be express in mathemat
form but in term irregular rather than regular
viii art and artist
the work of art is born of the artist in a mysteri and secret
wai from him it gain life and be nor is it exist
casual and inconsequ but it ha a definit and purpos
strength alik in it materi and spiritu life it exist and
ha power to creat spiritu atmospher and from thi inner
standpoint on judg whether it is a good work of art or a bad
on if it form is bad it mean that the form is too feebl in
mean to call forth correspond vibrat of the soul
footnot socal indec pictur ar either incap of
caus vibrat of the soul in which case thei ar not art
or thei ar so capabl in the latter case thei ar not to be
spurn absolut even though at the same time thei gratifi
what nowadai we ar pleas to call the lower bodili tast
therefor a pictur is not necessarili well paint if it
possess the valu of which the french so constantli speak
it is onli well paint if it spiritu valu is complet and
satisfi good draw is draw that cannot be alter
without destruct of thi inner valu quit irrespect of
it correct as anatomi botani or ani other scienc there
is no question of a violat of natur form but onli of the
need of the artist for such form similarli colour ar us not
becaus thei ar true to natur but becaus thei ar necessari
to the particular pictur in fact the artist is not onli
justifi in us but it is hi duti to us onli those form
which fulfil hi own need absolut freedom whether from anatomi
or anyth of the kind must be given the artist in hi choic
of materi such spiritu freedom is as necessari in art as it
is in life footnot thi freedom is man weapon against the
philistin it is base on the inner need
note howev that blind follow of scientif precept is less
blameworthi than it blind and purposeless reject the former
produc at least an imit of materi object which mai be
of some us
footnot plainli an imit of natur if made by the hand
of an artist is not a pure reproduct the voic of the soul
will in some degre at least make itself heard as contrast on
mai quot a landscap of canaletto and those sadli famou head
by denneralt pinakothek munich
the latter is an artist betray and bring confus in it
train the former leav the spiritu atmospher empti the
latter poison it
paint is an art and art is not vagu product transitori
and isol but a power which must be direct to the
improv and refin of the human soulto in fact the
rais of the spiritu triangl
if art refrain from do thi work a chasm remain unbridg
for no other power can take the place of art in thi activ
and at time when the human soul is gain greater strength art
will also grow in power for the two ar inextric connect
and complementari on to the other convers at those time
when the soul tend to be choke by materi disbelief art
becom purposeless and talk is heard that art exist for art
sake alon
footnot thi cry art for art sake is realli the best
ideal such an ag can attain to it is an unconsci protest
against materi against the demand that everyth should
have a us and practic valu it is further proof of the
indestruct of art and of the human soul which can never
be kill but onli temporarili smother
then is the bond between art and the soul as it were drug
into unconsci the artist and the spectat drift apart
till final the latter turn hi back on the former or regard
him as a juggler whose skill and dexter ar worthi of
applaus it is veri import for the artist to gaug hi
posit aright to realiz that he ha a duti to hi art and to
himself that he is not king of the castl but rather a servant
of a nobler purpos he must search deepli into hi own soul
develop and tend it so that hi art ha someth to cloth and
doe not remain a glove without a hand
the artist must have someth to sai for masteri over form is
not hi goal but rather the adapt of form to it inner
mean
footnot natur thi doe not mean that the artist is to
instil forcibl into hi work some deliber mean as ha
been said the gener of a work of art is a mysteri so long
as artistri exist there is no need of theori or logic to direct
the painter action the inner voic of the soul tell him what
form he need whether insid or outsid natur everi artist
know who work with feel how suddenli the right form
flash upon him bocklin said that a true work of art must be
like an inspir that actual paint composit etc ar
not the step by which the artist reach selfexpress
the artist is not born to a life of pleasur he must not live
idl he ha a hard work to perform and on which often prove a
cross to be born he must realiz that hi everi deed feel
and thought ar raw but sure materi from which hi work is to
aris that he is free in art but not in life
the artist ha a tripl respons to the nonartist 1 he
must repai the talent which he ha 2 hi deed feel and
thought as those of everi man creat a spiritu atmospher
which is either pure or poison 3 these deed and thought
ar materi for hi creation which themselv exercis
influenc on the spiritu atmospher the artist is not onli a
king as peladan sai becaus he ha great power but also
becaus he ha great duti
if the artist be priest of beauti nevertheless thi beauti is to
be sought onli accord to the principl of the inner need and
can be measur onli accord to the size and intens of that
need
that is beauti which is produc by the inner need which
spring from the soul
maeterlinck on of the first warrior on of the first modern
artist of the soul sai there is noth on earth so curiou
for beauti or so absorb of it as a soul for that reason few
mortal soul withstand the leadership of a soul which give to
them beauti footnot de la beaut interieur
and thi properti of the soul is the oil which facilit the
slow scarc visibl but irresist movement of the triangl
onward and upward
ix conclus
the first five illustr in thi book show the cours of
construct effort in paint thi effort fall into two
divis
1 simpl composit which is regul accord to an
obviou and simpl form thi kind of composit i call the
melod
2 complex composit consist of variou form subject
more or less complet to a princip form probabl the
princip form mai be hard to grasp outwardli and for that
reason possess of a strong inner valu thi kind of
composit i call the symphon
between the two lie variou transit form in which the
melod principl predomin the histori of the develop is
close parallel to that of music
if in consid an exampl of melod composit on forget
the materi aspect and probe down into the artist reason of
the whole on find primit geometr form or an
arrang of simpl line which help toward a common motion
thi common motion is echo by variou section and mai be
vari by a singl line or form such isol variat serv
differ purpos for instanc thei mai act as a sudden check
or to us a music term a fermata footnot eg the
ravenna mosaic which in the main form a triangl the upright
figur lean proportion to the triangl the outstretch
arm and doorcurtain ar the fermat each form which goe to
make up the composit ha a simpl inner valu which ha in
it turn a melodi for thi reason i call the composit
melod by the agenc of cezann and later of hodler footnot
english reader mai roughli parallel hodler with augustu john
for purpos of the argumentmth thi kind of composit
won new life and earn the name of rhythmic the limit
of the term rhythmic ar obviou in music and natur each
manifest ha a rhythm of it own so also in paint in
natur thi rhythm is often not clear to us becaus it purpos
is not clear to us we then speak of it as unrhythm so the
term rhythmic and unrhythm ar pure convent as also
ar harmoni and discord which have no actual exist
footnot as an exampl of plain melod construct with a
plain rhythm cezann bath women is given in thi book
complex rhythmic composit with a strong flavour of the
symphon is seen in numer pictur and woodcut of the past
on might mention the work of old german master of the
persian of the japanes the russian icon broadsid etc
footnot thi appli to mani of hodler pictur
in nearli all these work the symphon composit is not veri
close alli to the melod thi mean that fundament
there is a composit found on rest and balanc the mind
think at onc of choral composit of mozart and beethoven
all these work have the solemn and regular architectur of a
gothic cathedr thei belong to the transit period
as exampl of the new symphon composit in which the
melod element plai a subordin part and that onli rare i
have ad reproduct of four of my own pictur
thei repres three differ sourc of inspir
1 a direct impress of outward natur express in pure
artist form thi i call an impress
2 a larg unconsci spontan express of inner
charact the nonmateri natur thi i call an
improvis
3 an express of a slowli form inner feel which
come to utter onli after long matur thi i call a
composit in thi reason conscious purpos plai
an overwhelm part but of the calcul noth appear
onli the feel which kind of construct whether
consciou or unconsci realli underli my work the
patient reader will readili understand
final i would remark that in my opinion we ar fast
approach the time of reason and consciou composit when
the painter will be proud to declar hi work construct thi
will be in contrast to the claim of the impressionist that thei
could explain noth that their art came upon them by
inspir we have befor us the ag of consciou creation and
thi new spirit in paint is go hand in hand with the spirit
of thought toward an epoch of great spiritu leader
