the absolut want of ani comprehens book on needleworksuch an on
as contain both verbal and pictori descript of everyth
includ under the name of needleworkha led me to put into the
servic form of an encyclopedia all the knowledg and experi
which year of unceas studi and practic have enabl me to
accumul on the subject with the hope that dilig femal worker of
all ag mai be abl by it mean to instruct themselv in everi
branch of plain and fanci needlework
all the pattern given even the most insignific were work afresh
for the purpos and thu not mere faith represent but also
lucid and intellig explan of the same ar secur
in order that my reader mai have someth besid the dull theori the
work is enliven by a number of us pattern some new some deriv
from the artist product of such countri and epoch as have
becom famou by special excel in the domain of needlework
though at first sight the reproduct of mani of these pattern mai
seem to present insuper difficulti thei will after a care
studi of the text and exact attent to the direct given prove
easi to carri out
mani of these interest design ar drawn from privat collect
whose owner with great kind place their treasur at my
dispos to copi and borrow from at discret for which i desir to
take the present opportun of tender them my warmest thank
the choic of colour and materiala difficult matter to manymi
reader will find render compar easi to them by the note
affix to the illustr and i mai point out that most of the
pattern were work with dmc cotton which enjoi the wellearn
reput of be the veri best of their kind in the market of the
world
experi ha convinc me that in mani instanc these cotton mai
with advantag take the place of wool linen thread and even silk
if thi work meet with indulg judg and prove realli us i
shall find ampl reward in that fact for the troubl and difficulti
that have unavoid attend it complet

mani on open the encyclopedia of needlework will be dispos to
exclaim as thei read the head of thi first section what is the us
of describ all the old wellknown stitch when machin have so
nearli supersed the slower process of handsew to thi our repli
is that of all kind of needlework plain sew need to be most
thoroughli learn as be the foundat of all those who ar abl
to emploi other to work for them should at least know how to
distinguish good work from bad and those who ar in less fortun
circumst have to be taught how to work for themselv
posit of the bodi and handsbefor describ differ kind of
stitch a word should be said as to the posit of the bodi and hand
when at work long experi ha convinc me that no kind of
needlework necessit a stoop or cramp attitud to obviat
which see that your chair and tabl suit each other in height and that
you so hold your work as hardli to need to bend your head at all the
practic of fasten the work to the knee besid be ungrac is
injuri to the health
needlesthes should be of the best qualiti to test a needl try
to break it if it resist and then break clean in two the steel is
good if it bend without break or break without ani resist it
is bad never us a bent needl it make ugli and irregular stitch
and see that the ey whether round or eggshap be welldril that
it mai not frai or cut the thread long or halflong needl ar the
best for white work long on for dressmak and longer on still
with long ey for darn a stock of each from no 5 to 12 is
advis the needl should alwai be a littl thicker than the thread
to make an easi passag for it through the stuff
to keep needl from rust strew a littl stone alum in the packet
and worker whose hand ar apt to get damp should have a small box of
it handi to powder their finger with blacken needl can be made
quit bright again by draw them through an emeri cushion
scissorsscissor ar a veri import accessori of the worktabl
and two varieti ar indispens a pair of larg on for
cuttingout with on point blunt and the other sharp the latter to be
alwai held downward and a pair of smaller on with two sharp point
the handl should be larg and round if at all tight thei tire and
disfigur the hand
thimblesteel thimbl ar the best bone ar veri liabl to break
and silver on ar not deepli enough pit to hold the needl a
thimbl should be light with a round top and flat rim
the threadexcept for tack your thread should never be more than
from 40 to 50 cm long1 if the thread is in skein it doe not
matter which end you begin with but if you us reel cotton thread
your needl with the end that point to the reel when you cut it as
the other end will split and unravel when twist from left to right
which is gener done to facilit the process of thread the
cotton should alwai be cut as it is weaken by break
knot the thread into the needl fig 1when the thread becom
inconveni short and you do not want take a fresh on it mai be
knot into the needl thu bring it round the forefing close to
the needl cross it on the insid next to the finger hold the cross
thread fast with the thumb draw the needl out through the loop thu
form and tighten the loop round both end

finger to take hold of it and draw it out the thread then come to lie

backstitch the beauti of stitch depend on the uniform length of
the stitch and the straight of the line form to ensur which
it is necessari to count the thread for each stitch and to draw a
thread to mark the line if you have to stitch in a slant line across
the stuff or the stuff be such as to render the draw of a thread

set the stitch two or three thread apart in a continu
straight line to ensur the hem be straight a thread mai be drawn
to mark the line for the second turn but it is not a good plan

tapestri is on of the oldest kind of needlework and on which ha
alwai been popular everi where
there ar two distinct sort of canva in us for tapestri call
respect plain singl thread canva and penelop doubl
thread canva the latter is gener prefer becaus it is easier
to count the stitch upon it but both make an equal good foundat
for the embroideri as the follow exampl will show
besid canva other fabric bear a close resembl to it ar
often us especi java linen the close textur of which render
ground unnecessari
cloth velvet or plush can also be overlaid with canva the thread of
which ar pull awai after the pattern is finish for work of thi
kind we howev prefer a materi with less dress such as a twist
tammi or colbert linen becaus the pull out of the harsh rough
thread of the canva is veri apt to injur the materi beneath
stitch work upon two stuff must be drawn veri tight or thei will
look loos and untidi when the auxiliari fabric is taken awai
tapestri can be done either in a frame or in the hand in the latter
case the end of the piec of canva should be weight with stone or
lead to prevent it pucker
the stitch which ought complet to hide the canva should all lean
on wai and the underneath on alwai from left to right as the
letter in write
mark out the embroideri ground fig 252befor begin a

lai the thread over the thumb so that the end li outsid put in the

illustr fig 342 cross cast on with a singl thread
cross cast on with a threefold threadthi method is similar to
the last onli that the thread is taken threefold and is drawn by the
needl through the loop which is form at the bend of the thread then
you pass the singl thread over the left hand and the tripl on over
the thumb as shown in fig 342 and make the same stitch as abov
the threefold thread make a broad chain at the bottom of the loop
doubl cross cast on fig 343thi can be done either with a

the first stitch is made as we have alreadi describ onli that you

through the loop on the left needl then transfer it as a fresh stitch
to the left needl catch the needl into thi second stitch and draw
the thread through it to form the third and so on
thi method of cast on is us for articl that ar to have a
doubl edg see fig 355 356 becaus stitch made in thi wai
ar easier to pick up than the tighter on but it should not be us
where it will form the actual edg as the loop ar alwai too open

net is a handicraft so ancient that it would be difficult to trace
it to it origin or determin the date of it invent there is
evid to show that the make of net for fish and game catch
wa as familiar to the earlier race of mankind as it is to us
practis in the first instanc for the want of life it by degre
develop into an art in conjunct with embroideri to which it wa
made to serv as a foundat the net of everi countri almost ha
a distinct charact of it own that of persia is known by it fine
silken mesh and rich gold and silver embroideri that of itali by the
vari size and shape of it mesh and a resembl in the style of
it embroideri to the punto tagliato whilst the net of franc
known by the name of cluni guipur consist of a groundwork of fine
mesh with stiff close design embroid upon it outlin in coars
glaze thread
net which divid itself under two head net proper or
plain net and net embroideri ha never yet gone out of fashion and
place ar still to be found where the entir popul is engag in
thi industri
plain net and the implement us in net fig 611 612

net needl these ar gener made of steel split and flatten
at both end with a hole bore through them below the fork at the on
end in which the thread fig 611 is secur befor it is wound on
lengthwis between the fork thei ar number as to size like knit
needl there ar net needl likewis of bone ivori wood and
tortoiseshel for twine and thick materi these ar without hole

the thread must be wound on veri tightli and not too much of it at a
time that the needl mai slip easili through the loop the mesh or
spool fig 613 whether of ivori bone steel or wood should be smooth
and round and of the same thick throughout so that the loop made
upon it mai be all of on size and easili slip off

for long loop a flat mesh is best and in all case the needl and
mesh should be select with a view both to the materi emploi and
the size of loop requir
in addit to these two implement a cushion weight with lead will
be requir to pin the foundat loop to on which the first row of
net is work
materi suitabl for nettingthes of cours depend on the
purpos of the net silk twine wool and cotton can all be us
and each possess it advantag and disadvantag silk ha the finest
gloss but when it is strongli twist it is veri apt to knot and when
loos twist doe not make firm knot it is difficult to get linen
thread with a smooth uniform twist and moreov it soon frai in the

it will be found less try for the ey to lai a piec of transpar
colour paper or stuff under the pattern whilst you ar copi it
the irish lace design ar almost all drawn with doubl line between

tack down and gather in the braid fig 693where the line

the stitch made for the bar and the fill must never be drawn so

number of the cotton be well assort to the kind of lace
the winder fig 778everi on who mean to take the work serious
should provid themselv with a winder as here repres which is

the prepar of the pattern in most kind of needlework is a most
import matter and on requir the greatest care but in the case of
needlemad lace and pillow lace the process ar differ
the paper on which the design is trace must first be back or line
with unglaz black paper made special for thi purpos prick hole
all along the line of the pattern at exactli the same distanc from
each other remov the trace and tack the black paper upon rather
coars linen
thi done you take from three to five length of the thread of which
the lace is to be made lai them down togeth upon the line mark by
the prick and secur them at each hole by a stitch made over the
thread
fig 822 with the other of the same seri in their natur size show
the proper distanc that should be left between the prick and the
lai down of the thread begun whilst in fig 823 we have the
thread laid down throughout even for the littl eyelet hole which

when all thi preliminari work is finish the pattern is readi for the

outlin in order to keep your work perfectli clean and preserv it
from unnecessari contact with your finger cover all those part of the

with a hole about the size of a pea cut in it thi you move along as
you go work onli at the part of the pattern which is visibl through
the hole keep all the rest carefulli cover up and sew paper
over each part as soon as it is finish thi should not be remov
until you ar readi to join all the separ part togeth with bar or

all the differ lace stitch that ar us as fill must be begun
and fasten off at the outlin thread which you must be care not

we again remark for the benefit of those of our reader who mai not

practic direct
hitherto we have been chiefli occupi with descript and
explan of the differ kind of needlework to render these
complet it remain for us to give a few practic direct with
regard to the copi adjust and transposit of the pattern as
well as to the differ process often so essenti to the ultim
success of a piec of needlework for thi success will soon be found
not to depend on the stitch onli but veri larg on the proper
adapt of the design to the space it is intend to fill
then in the case of new lace it is necessari to know the amount of
dress it will requir to give it the right stiff and when thi
dress ha worn off how to renew it whilst in the case of appliqu
work more especi it is indispens to know exactli what the
ingredi ar of which the past should be compos and how to make
and lai it on in the proper manner
trace pattern against a window panein order to copi a pattern in
thi wai the first step is to tack or pin the piec of stuff or paper
on which the copi is to be made upon the pattern in the case of a small
pattern the tack or pin mai be dispens with and the two
sheet held firmli press against the window pane with the left hand
whilst the right hand doe the trace but even then it is safer to pin
or gum the four corner of the two sheet togeth in case of
interrupt as it is difficult to fit them togeth again exactli
the trace mai be done with a pencil or better still with a brush
dip in indian ink or watercolour paint
the process of trace is easi enough so long as the hand doe not get
tire but as thi gener come to pass veri soon it is best if the
pattern be a larg and complic on to stick the sheet to the pane
with strong gum or suspend them on a string fasten across the pane by
pin stuck into the window frame on either side
to take off a pattern by rubbingif you want to take a pattern of a
piec of embroideri direct from the work itself lai it the right side
up flat upon a board or tabl and cover it with letter or tissu paper
the paper should be of a good medium thick if it be too thick it
will not take a clear impress of the pattern and if veri thin it is
apt to tear
fasten the paper down upon the embroideri with drawingpin and rub off
the pattern with drawingwax in default of the right kind of wax the
bowl or handl of a spoon or a larg silver coin will serv the purpos
equal well as will also some powder graphit or charcoal the
outlin will not of cours in ani case be veri clearli defin upon
the paper and will have to be gone over and carefulli supplement
afterward with a pencil
take off the pattern with charcoal or graphit is less injuri to
the embroideri than rub it off with wax or metal as the pressur
requir in the latter case flatten the needlework veri consider
as soon as you have fix the line of the pattern by draw them over
with ink it is readi for us
to transfer a pattern direct on to the stuffpattern cannot be
copi by either of the abov method direct on to the stuff and can
onli be us when the stuff on which the embroideri is to be execut
is transpar in the case of thick close fabric the draw must be
made on the stuff itself the follow is the simplest wai of
transfer a pattern on to a transpar stuff begin by go over
all the line of the draw with indian ink so as to make them quit
thick and distinct and tack the paper with larg stitch on to the
back of the stuff then mix some veri dark powder indigo dilut with
water in a glass with a small pinch of sugar and powder gum arab
and us thi as ink and a fine pen veri slightli split trace the
pattern that shine through on the stuff
the trace must be veri slight for if the embroideri be not done till
some time afterward the line get so firmli fix in the stuff that on
wash will not obliter them the trace ink moreov make the
work unpleasantli sticki
to copi with oil paperanoth rather expediti mode of
transfer pattern on to thin and more especi smooth glossi
stuff is by mean of a special kind of tint paper call
autograph paper which is impregn with a colour oili substanc
and is to be had at ani station shop thi you place between the
pattern and the stuff have previous fasten the stuff perfectli
straight by the line of the thread to a board with drawingpin when
you have fit the two paper likewis exactli togeth you go over
all the line of the pattern with a blunt pencil or with what is
better still the point of a bone crochet needl or the edg of a
folder you must be care not to press so heavili upon the pattern
paper as to tear it by the pressur exercis on the two sheet of
paper the oili substanc of the blue paper discharg itself on to the
stuff so that when it is remov all the line you have trace ar
imprint upon the stuff
thi blue trace paper is howev onli avail for the reproduct
of pattern on wash stuff as satin and all other silki textur ar
discolour by it
to pounc pattern upon stuffsth mode of copi hitherto
describ cannot be indiscrimin us for all kind of stuff for
cloth velvet and plush for instanc thei ar not avail and
pounc is the onli wai that answer
the pattern after have been transfer to straw or parchment paper
have to be prick through to do thi you lai the paper upon cloth or
felt and prick out all the line of the draw make the hole which
should be clear and round all exactli the same distanc apart
the closer and more complic the pattern is the finer and closer the
hole should be everi line of the outlin must be carefulli prick
out
if the paper be suffici thin sever pounc can be prick at
the same time and a symmetr design can be fold togeth into four
and all prick at onc
the prick pattern ha next to be tack upon the materi the side
from which the prick wa done next to the stuff and the littl
funnelshap hole uppermost paper and stuff must be firmli fasten
down and kept in posit by draw pin so that neither of them mai
move dure the process otherwis you will have doubl line on the
stuff which you will find veri confus afterward
for the pounc us either powder chalk or charcoal accord to
whether the stuff be dark or light in colour dip the pounc
implement a thing like a small drumstick stuf and cover with
cloth into the powder and rub it lightli over the whole surfac of the
prick pattern so that the powder penetr through the pinhol to
the stuff in default of a proper pounc implement take a small stripe
of cloth roll it up round a stick and wind a string round and dip thi
into the powder
when the powder ha penetr to the stuff remov the paper and if the
pattern is to be repeat lai it on again further on take care to
make the line meet exactli so that the join mai not be seen
when you have finish the pounc and taken off the paper you proce
to draw or rather paint in the pattern with watercolour paint
ackermann ar the best for the purpos no other as far as our
experi ha prove adher so well to even the roughest fabric or so
littl affect the brillianc of the embroideri thread four paint
blue black yellow and white ar suffici for all purpos whatev
the colour of the stuff mai be
on a smooth surfac the trace mai be done with a pen but a small
sablehair brush is prefer under all circumst
the rougher and more hairi the surfac the finer the brush ought to be
in order that the colour mai sink well in between the fibr
befor begin to paint in the pattern gentli blow awai all the
superflu powder from the surfac thi process mai be object to as
be an old on which ha been supersed by new invent a resin
powder for instanc by the us of which pattern can be fix as soon
as thei have been pounc by pass a hot iron over the stuff a sheet
of paper have first been laid upon it to protect it or els a mixtur
of gum and powder which can be dissolv on the stuff itself by the
steam of spiritsofwin and variou other process needless to
mention here as some ar onli us in trace pattern on a larg
scale whilst other requir a varieti of applianc not as a rule
within the reach of those to whom needlework is a simpl recreat
the prepar of the stuff and the subdivis of the
patternslong year of experi and practic have brought us in
contact with a good mani design mani of them artist in their wai
so long as it wa onli a question of put their own composit on
paper but who yet found themselv confront by real difficulti the
moment thei were call upon to transfer them to stuff
we shall as far as possibl point out to our reader the precaut
to be taken in trace pattern and must for that purpos go back to on
of the first oper name that of prick
to begin with the paper on which the pattern is should alwai be larg
enough for there to be a clear margin of from 4 to 5 cm all round the
pattern so that the pounc instrument mai never come in contact with
the stuff beneath
in transfer pattern to stuff no line of divis should ever be
made directli upon it either with lead chalk or charcoal as it is
hardli ever possibl entir to obliter them and thei often becom
veri confus afterward
befor begin the trace divid your stuff into four then decid
what the width of the border outsid the pattern is to be it is quit
an except thing to carri a pattern right up to the edg stuff
that will take a bend such as all linen and cotton textur can be
fold in four like the paper the fold ought then to be pinch and
press down so that the line mai remain clear and distinct until the
trace be finish
after divid it into four mark out the diagon line these ar
absolut necessari in order to get the corner figur rightli place
though most of our reader know how to make these line on paper with a
pencil and ruler few easi as it is know how to make them upon stuff
you have onli to fold over the corner of your piec of stuff so that the
outsid thread of the warp or cut edg run parallel with the woof edg
which mark the angl of the foldov
thi doubl fold over divid the ground into 8 part to arrang for
the outsid border or margin is easi enough if the stuff and the kind
of work you ar go to do upon it admit of the draw out of thread
as then a thread drawn out each wai serv as a guid for trace the
pattern straight to the line of the stuff it is often better howev
not to draw out the thread for an openwork border till the pattern be
trace if you do not wish or ar not abl to draw out thread to mark
the pattern and you ar work on a stuff of which the thread can be
count follow the direct given on page 128 and explain in fig
252
you cannot mark cloth silk stuff or plush by fold them in the abov
wai cloth and some kind of silken textur will not take a bend and
other that will would be spoil by it
all such stuff should be mount in a frame befor the pattern be
trace and the ground be then divid out in the follow wai take a
strong thread make a knot at on end stick a pin into it and tighten
the knot round it with a pair of compass divid on of the side
into two equal part stick the pin with the knot round it in at the
middl and the same on the opposit side put in a second pin by
mean of which you stretch the thread carri other thread across in a
similar wai in the width of the stuff and from corner to corner and you
will have your ground correctli mark out in such a manner as to leav
no mark when after pounc in the pattern you remov the thread
befor finish the pounc of a pattern see that it is the right
size for the purpos it is intend for
suppos that you ar trace a border with a corner you should
measur the length it will occupi and then by a veri light pounc you
can mark the point from which the pattern will have to be repeat it
mai be that a gap will be left in the middl which if not too larg
can be got rid of without alter the pattern by push the whole
thing a littl further in and so shorten the distanc between the two
corner
should the gap howev be too larg for thi you will have to make a
supplementari design to fill up the place the same thing would be
necessari in the case of your have to shorten a pattern
to transpos and repeat pattern by mean of lookingglass fig
885we have refer to the necess that often occur of adapt
pattern to certain given proport thi can in most case be done
easili enough without the help of a draughtsman especi in the case
of cross stitch embroideri by mean of two unfram lookingglass
penelop mirror as thei ar call us in the follow manner
if you want to util a piec onli of a straight border or after
repeat it sever time to form a corner with it you place the
mirror in the first instanc across it at right angl at the place
from which the pattern is to be repeat and then exactli diagon
inward
to make a squar out of a straight pattern you take two mirror and so
place them that thei touch at the point where the diagon line meet
as repres in fig 885 and you have your squar at onc
thi is all easi enough but befor begin ani larg piec of work it
is necessari to consid carefulli which part of the draw will best
fill the centr and which ar best suit to form the corner as it is
not everi part of a straight pattern that is adapt for repetit
a few preliminari trial with the help of the mirror will better show
the import of these explan than anyth further we can sai on
the subject
illustr fig 885 to transpos and repeat a straight pattern by
mean of look glass
to alter the proport of a pattern by divid the ground into
squar fig 886 and 887case will occur where it will be found
necessari to subject the pattern to greater modif still than
those we have hitherto been deal with
you want for exampl to embroid a rather larg run ground
pattern on a piec of stuff that is rel too small for the
subject or a small and rather minut pattern on a larg surfac on
which it is like to look either too insignific or too crowd and
confus and the chanc ar if you do not know how to draw you will
either think it necessari to get a draughtsman to help you or you will
give up the piec of work altogeth deter by the difficulti that
confront you you need not do either if you will follow the direct
here given
take a sheet of larges quadril paper which if necessari you can
prepar for yourself trace your pattern upon it or rule the squar
direct upon the draw as shown in fig 886
illustr fig 886 divid the ground into squar befor
copi
on a second sheet of veget paper rule squar a fourth a third or
half as small again as those on the first sheet thu if the side of
the first squar be 15 mm long and you want to reduc your pattern by
on fifth the side of your new squar should measur onli 12 mm
if on the contrari you want to enlarg the pattern by on fifth make
the side of your squar 18 mm long
then you follow squar by squar the line of the draw extend
or contract them accord to whether the pattern is to be enlarg
or diminish
to copi a pattern directli from a piec of embroideri and enlarg or
diminish it at the same time proce as follow fix the embroideri on
a board stretch it equal in everi direct then measur the
length of the draw divid the centimetr by the number of unit
correspond to whatev the proport of your copi ar to be and if
there be ani fraction of centimetr over subdivid them into
millimetr if necessari into half millimetr and make your divis
by whatev measur you have adopt take a pair of compass with dry
point open them suffici for the open to correspond to the
number and the distanc obtain by the divis plant a pin with a
thread fasten to it at the point indic by the point of the
compass and repeat the last oper all along on side of the
embroideri and if possibl a littl beyond it so that it mai not be
defac by the mark of the pin all you now have to do is to pull the
thread in perfectli straight line to the opposit side and carri other
thread across them in a similar manner so that the whole surfac be
divid into squar
illustr fig 887 pattern reduc by mark out the ground in

it is needless to sai that if you have to trace a pattern from a mount
piec of work you cannot stretch it on a board with a littl invent
howev some wai can alwai be found of plant the pin so as not to
injur the work

to prepar the past for appliqu workit mai seem strang to devot
a separ paragraph to such an appar simpl oper but in
appliqu work it is a most import on as not onli the stuff on which
the work is done but all the expens accessori ar liabl to be
spoilt by past that ha been badli prepar
put some wheaten not rice starch into a vessel with a round bottom
pour on just enough water to dissolv the starch and stir it with a
wooden spoon till it becom perfectli smooth
in the meantim put about of a pint of clean water on the fire to
boil and when it boil add to it a littl powder pitch or carpent
glue in quantiti about the size of a pea and pour in the starch
stir it the whole time when the mixtur ha boil up sever time
take it off the fire and go on stir it till it get cold otherwis
lump will form in it which as we special point out in the
preced chapter must never be allow to get in between the stuff and
the paper
thi kind of past make no spot and doe not injur even the most
delic colour as it contain no acid in winter it will keep for
sever dai but in hot weather it veri soon begin to ferment and
should then on no account be us
gum arab ought never to be us for appliqu work as it becom so
hard that it is imposs to get the needl through whilst the
saccharin it contain almost alwai caus ugli spot to appear in the
stuff when it dri
when the work is finish it is a good plan to spread a veri thin layer
of past over the entir back of it with a fine brush made of hog
bristl and not to take it out of the frame until it is perfectli dry
to stiffen new needleworkin the chapter on irish lace page 441
we said that new needlework of that kind had to be iron thi should
be done in the follow manner when the lace ha been taken off it
foundat lai it face downward on a piec of fine white flannel
then dip a piec of veri stiff new organdi muslin into water take it
out again almost immedi and wring it slightli so that no drop mai
fall from it and then dab the wrong side of the lace all over with thi
pad of damp muslin and iron it with a hot iron which should be move
slowli forward so that the moistur which the organdi ha impart to
the lace mai evapor slowli not until you ar quit sure that the
lace is dry should it be taken off the board
there is no better wai than thi of give new lace that almost
impercept degre of stiff by which alon it is often to be
distinguish from old water onli doe not stiffen the thread
suffici and it is difficult with starch to hit upon exactli the
right consist wherea the organdi muslin suppli just the need
quantiti
embroid network can be stiffen in the same manner and should be
damp in the frame on the wrong side and not taken off until it is
quit dry
we even recommend embroideri on linen be treat in the same wai but
when the linen is veri creas cover it with a damp cloth and iron upon
that first then take the cloth awai and iron the embroideri itself so
as to dry it complet
to wash ordinari lacewind it round a bottl the same width top and
bottom and cover it entir with muslin fasten to the lace by a few
stitch fill the bottl half full of sand so that it mai not get
knock about too violent when the water boil
immers the bottl in a saucepan of cold water with a piec of soap the
size of a nut in it and if the lace be veri dirti a small pinch of
salt and let it boil for about an hour pour off the water as it get
dirti and ad clean
when all the dirt ha been boil out of the lace which you will know
to be the case when the water remain perfectli clear rins out the
soap befor you take the lace off the bottl by plung it into cold
water
to wash real laceth process is the same as the abov but as real
lace is so seldom wash and is gener veri yellow and fragil
particularli if it ha been roughli us it is rather difficult to
clean
if stain or greasi it should be left to soak for some hour or even
dai in good oliv oil thi restor to the thread that soft and
smooth which us and bad wash had impair after the oil bath it
should be wash on a bottl in the manner alreadi describ
to stiffen lacedip the lace when perfectli dry in thin starch
prepar as follow
take as much fine wheaten starch as you think you will requir divid
it into two portion and dissolv both in cold water boil the on
portion and when it ha so far cool as to have ceas to steam stir
the cold starch into it and dilut the whole with cold water to the
consist of thick cream if the lace is to be slightli colour add
a few drop of black coffe or dilut the starch with weak tea or
guimauv water the coffe will give it a dark cream colour either of
the latter a pale greenish hue
dip the lace in the mixtur and squeez it out gentli without wring
it to get rid of all the superflu liquid then lai it flat on the
left hand and beat it for a few minut with the right to work the
starch well in repeat the whole process twice then roll the lace in
fine linen and leav it there till you ar readi to iron or pin it out
as the case mai be
to iron laceaft the lace ha lain for an hour or two in the
cloth iron it if it be machinemad and if it be irish guipur or real
point lace of ani sort pin it out
befor you begin to iron hold the lace tight in your left hand by the
foot and with the right hand pull out all the picot along the edg
of the lace to an equal length then lai it out flat upon a board
cover with white flannel and iron it with a moder hot iron
pass the iron backward and forward over it until it be quit dry
if creas should come in the iron where thei ought not to be dab
them over lightli with a spong moisten with water and a few drop of
starch and pass the iron over them again
after iron the whole length of lace pull it out crosswai from left
to right and from right to left and iron it all over onc more thi
doe awai with the artifici stiff and give it the agreeabl
soft and plianci of new lace
to pin out lacein order to pin out lace in a thoroughli
satisfactori manner you should provid yourself with a wooden drum
about 30 cm high and from 50 to 60 cm in diamet larg enough to
rest upon the knee
the outsid circumfer of the wood should be pad and cover with
grei or white tick
the pin must be exactli the size of the picot thei ar to pin down
you will requir extrem fine on for valencienn and coarser for
other kind of lace steel pin ar of no us whatev becaus of their
liabil to rust cover the cylind with blue paper less try for
the ey than ani other and take onli just as much lace out of the damp
cloth as you ar like to be abl to pin out befor it get dry
keep the remaind cover up
lai the lace upon the drum and pin the foot down first in a straight
line stick the pin in pretti close and at regular distanc
apart then pin down each picot separ take care not to open them
if thei have kept their origin shape and to shut them up by twist
them if thei have got untwist
if you find the pin out troublesom and cannot get it all done
befor the lace dri damp the picot with a spong as you proce
lace should never be pin out when it is dry as the thread of the
picot ar then veri apt to break and torn picot destroi the valu of
even the choicest lace
rais lace ha to be stamp out from the wrong side with a lace awl or
kind of pricker of bone made for the purpos some profession
laceclean us thi implement even for valencienn lace but we
cannot recommend it see that it is a lace that is by natur
perfectli flat
let the length of lace you have pin out remain on the drum till it be
quit dry if you have sever yard to pin out wind it round and round
the cylind cover up the lace as you proce and put each length awai
as soon as it is readi in a blue paper bag so as to keep the whole
perfectli clean
in conclus we mai remark that the clean of lace should onli be
undertaken when you ar fairli sure of not be interrupt as more
especi the pin requir to be finish off as quickli as
possibl
to wash colour cotton and work done with the samein order to
test the fast of the dye unti the skein and pour boil water
upon them leav them to soak for about a quarter of an hour soap and
rub them lightli with the hand from end to end and rins them out
thoroughli in as mani chang of cold water as mai be found necessari
until the water remain perfectli colourless
squeez out all the water you can and let them dry quickli without
expos them to the sun
colour cotton ar often wash in vinegar becaus it is suppos to
affect the colour less than water doe we have come to the conclus
after sever trial that thi is a delus for the good dye keep

spite of it
the fast colour lose none of their beauti in the process nor doe it
affect the qualiti of the cotton ani excess of colour matter which
the fibr of the cotton mai have absorb in the process of dye is
got rid of by thi mean
if a piec of work ha been done with unwash cotton and the colour

chang of tepid water to restor it to it origin fresh and if
you want to give it a yellowish ting it should be dip it in weak
tea or coffe

the choic of colour and materi render compar easi to them

had it not been for the follow tabl which we were fortun
enabl to append to our work and which will help everi on to choos
