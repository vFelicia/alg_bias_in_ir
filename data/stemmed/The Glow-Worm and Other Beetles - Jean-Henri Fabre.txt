the life of the weevil and more beetl respect
the glowworm which give it name to the present book did not

it is on of two essai written special at my request for
translat into english toward the close of henri fabr life in
fact thi and the antlion a short essai for children were the

the glowworm
few insect in our clime vie in popular fame with the glowworm that
curiou littl anim which to celebr the littl joi of life
kindl a beacon at it tailend who doe not know it at least by
name who ha not seen it roam amid the grass like a spark fallen
from the moon at it full the greek of old call it greek
lampouri mean the brighttail scienc emploi the same term
it call the lanternbear lampyri noctiluca lin in thi case
the common name is inferior to the scientif phrase which when
translat becom both express and accur
in fact we might easili cavil at the word worm the lampyri is not
a worm at all not even in gener appear he ha six short leg
which he well know how to us he is a gadabout a trotabout in
the adult state the male is correctli garb in wingcas like the
true beetl that he is the femal is an illfavour thing who know
naught of the delight of fly all her life long she retain the
larval shape which for the rest is similar to that of the male who
himself is imperfect so long as he ha not achiev the matur that
come with pairingtim even in thi initi stage the word worm
is out of place we french have the express nake as a worm to
point to the lack of ani defens cover now the lampyri is
cloth that is to sai he wear an epidermi of some consist
moreov he is rather richli colour hi bodi is dark brown all
over set off with pale pink on the thorax especi on the lower
surfac final each segment is deck at the hinder edg with two
spot of a fairli bright red a costum like thi wa never worn by a
worm
let us leav thi illchosen denomin and ask ourselv what the
lampyri feed upon that master of the art of gastronomi
brillatsavarin1 said
show me what you eat and i will tell you what you ar

a similar question should be address by wai of a preliminari to
everi insect whose habit we propos to studi for from the least to
the greatest in the zoolog progress the stomach swai the
world the data suppli by food ar the chief of all the document of
life well in spite of hi innoc appear the lampyri is an
eater of flesh a hunter of game and he follow hi call with rare
villaini hi regular prei is the snail
thi detail ha long been known to entomologist what is not so
wellknown what is not known at all yet to judg by what i have
read is the curiou method of attack of which i have seen no other
instanc anywher
befor he begin to feast the glowworm administ an ansthet he
chloroform hi victim rival in the process the wonder of our
modern surgeri which render the patient insens befor oper
on him the usual game is a small snail hardli the size of a cherri
such as for instanc helix variabili drap who in the hot
weather collect in cluster on the stiff stubbl and on other long
dry stalk by the roadsid and there remain motionless in profound
medit throughout the scorch summer dai it is in some such
restingplac as thi that i have often been privileg to light upon
the lampyri banquet on the prei which he had just paralyz on it
shaki support by hi surgic artific
but he is familiar with other preserv he frequent the edg of the
irrigatingditch with their cool soil their vari veget a
favourit haunt of the mollusc here he treat the game on the
ground and under these condit it is easi for me to rear him at
home and to follow the oper perform down to the smallest
detail
i will try to make the reader a wit of the strang sight i place
a littl grass in a wide glass jar in thi i instal a few glowworm
and a provis of snail of a suitabl size neither too larg nor
too small chiefli helix variabili we must be patient and wait
abov all we must keep an assidu watch for the desir event
come unexpectedli and do not last long
here we ar at last the glowworm for a moment investig the prei
which accord to it habit is wholli withdrawn in the shell
except the edg of the mantl which project slightli then the
hunter weapon is drawn a veri simpl weapon but on that cannot be
plainli perceiv without the aid of a len it consist of two
mandibl bent back powerfulli into a hook veri sharp and as thin as
a hair the microscop reveal the presenc of a slender groov
run throughout the length and that is all
the insect repeatedli tap the snail mantl with it instrument it
all happen with such gentl as to suggest kiss rather than
bite as children teas on anoth we us to talk of
tweaksi to express a slight squeez of the fingertip someth
more like a tickl than a seriou pinch let us us that word in
convers with anim languag lose noth by remain juvenil
it is the right wai for the simpl to understand on anoth
the lampyri dole out hi tweak he distribut them method
without hurri and take a brief rest after each of them as though
he wish to ascertain the effect produc their number is not great
halfadozen at most to subdu the prei and depriv it of all power
of movement that other pinch ar administ later at the time of
eat seem veri like but i cannot sai anyth for certain
becaus the sequel escap me the first few howeverther ar never
manyar enough to impart inertia and loss of all feel to the
mollusc thank to the prompt i might almost sai lightn method
of the lampyri who beyond a doubt instil some poison or other by
mean of hi groov hook
here is the proof of the sudden efficac of those twitch so mild
in appear i take the snail from the lampyri who ha oper on
the edg of the mantl some four or five time i prick him with a
fine needl in the forepart which the anim shrunk into it shell
still leav expos there is no quiver of the wound tissu no
reaction against the brutal of the needl a corps itself could
not give fewer sign of life
here is someth even more conclus chanc occasion give me
snail attack by the lampyri while thei ar creep along the
foot slowli crawl the tentacl swollen to their full extent a
few disord movement betrai a brief excit on the part of the
mollusc and then everyth ceas the foot no longer slug the
frontpart lose it grace swanneck curv the tentacl becom
limp and give wai under their weight dangl feebli like a broken
stick thi condit persist
is the snail realli dead not at all for i am free to resuscit the
seem corps after two or three dai of that singular condit
which is no longer life and yet not death i isol the patient and
although thi is not realli necessari to success i give him a douch
which will repres the shower so dear to the ablebodi mollusc in
about a coupl of dai my prison but late injur by the
glowworm treacheri is restor to hi normal state he reviv in
a manner he recov movement and sensibl he is affect by the
stimulu of a needl he shift hi place crawl put out hi
tentacl as though noth unusu had occur the gener torpor
a sort of deep drunken ha vanish outright the dead return to
life what name shall we give to that form of exist which for a
time abolish the power of movement and the sens of pain i can see
but on that is approxim suitabl ansthesia the exploit of a
host of wasp whose flesheat grub ar provid with meat that is
motionless though not dead2 have taught us the skil art of the
paralyz insect which numb the locomotori nervecentr with it
venom we have now a humbl littl anim that first produc complet
ansthesia in it patient human scienc did not in realiti invent
thi art which is on of the wonder of our latterdai surgeri much
earlier far back in the centuri the lampyri and appar
other knew it as well the anim knowledg had a long start of
our the method alon ha chang our oper proce by make us
inhal the fume of ether or chloroform the insect proce by
inject a special viru that come from the mandibular fang in
infinitesim dose might we not on dai be abl to benefit by thi
hint what gloriou discoveri the futur would have in store for us
if we understood the beasti secret better

what doe the lampyri want with ansthet talent against a
harmless and moreov emin peac adversari who would never
begin the quarrel of hi own accord i think i see we find in algeria
a beetl known as drilu maroccanu who though nonlumin
approach our glowworm in hi organ and especi in hi
habit he too feed on land mollusc hi prei is a cyclostom with a
grace spiral shell tightclos with a stoni lid which is attach
to the anim by a power muscl the lid is a movabl door which is
quickli shut by the inmat mere withdraw into hi hous and as
easili open when the hermit goe forth with thi system of close
the abod becom inviol and the drilu know it
fix to the surfac of the shell by an adhes apparatu whereof the
lampyri will present show us the equival he remain on the
lookout wait if necessari for whole dai at a time at last
the need of air and food oblig the besieg noncombat to show
himself at least the door is set slightli ajar that is enough the
drilu is on the spot and strike hi blow the door can no longer be
close and the assail is henceforth master of the fortress our
first impress is that the muscl move the lid ha been cut with a
quickact pair of shear thi idea must be dismiss the drilu
is not well enough equip with jaw to gnaw through a fleshi mass so
promptli the oper ha to succe at onc at the first touch if
not the anim attack would retreat still in full vigour and the
sieg must be recommenc as arduou as ever expos the insect to
fast indefinit prolong although i have never come across the
drilu who is a stranger to my district i conjectur a method of
attack veri similar to that of the glowworm like our own
snaileat the algerian insect doe not cut it victim into small
piec it render it inert chloroform it by mean of a few tweak
which ar easili distribut if the lid but halfopen for a second
that will do the besieg thereupon enter and in perfect quiet
consum a prei incap of the least muscular effort that is how i
see thing by the unaid light of logic
let us now return to the glowworm when the snail is on the ground
creep or even shrunk into hi shell the attack never present ani
difficulti the shell possess no lid and leav the hermit
forepart to a great extent expos here on the edg of the mantl
contract by the fear of danger the mollusc is vulner and
incap of defenc but it also frequent happen that the snail
occupi a rais posit cling to the tip of a grassstalk or
perhap to the smooth surfac of a stone thi support serv him as a
temporari lid it ward off the aggress of ani churl who might try
to molest the inhabit of the cabin alwai on the express condit
that no slit show itself anywher on the protect circumfer if
on the other hand in the frequent case when the shell doe not fit
it support quit close some point howev tini be left
uncov thi is enough for the subtl tool of the lampyri who
just nibbl at the mollusc and at onc plung him into that profound
immobl which favour the tranquil proceed of the consum
these proceed ar mark by extrem prudenc the assail ha to
handl hi victim gingerli without provok contract which would
make the snail let go hi support and at the veri least precipit
him from the tall stalk whereon he is blissfulli slumber now ani
game fall to the ground would seem to be so much sheer loss for
the glowworm ha no great zeal for huntingexpedit he profit by
the discoveri which good luck send him without undertak
assidu search it is essenti therefor that the equilibrium
of a prize perch on the top of a stalk and onli just held in
posit by a touch of glue should be disturb as littl as possibl
dure the onslaught it is necessari that the assail should go to
work with infinit circumspect and without produc pain lest ani
muscular reaction should provok a fall and endang the prize as we
see sudden and profound ansthesia is an excel mean of enabl
the lampyri to attain hi object which is to consum hi prei in
perfect quiet
what is hi manner of consum it doe he realli eat that is to
sai doe he divid hi food piecem doe he carv it into minut
particl which ar afterward ground by a chewingapparatu i think
not i never see a trace of solid nourish on my captiv mouth
the glowworm doe not eat in the strict sens of the word he drink
hi fill he feed on a thin gruel into which he transform hi prei
by a method recal that of the maggot like the flesheat grub
of the fly he too is abl to digest befor consum he liquefi
hi prei befor feed on it
thi is how thing happen a snail ha been render insens by the
glowworm the oper is nearli alwai alon even when the prize is
a larg on like the common snail helix aspersa soon a number of
guest hasten uptwo three or moreand without ani quarrel with
real proprietor all alik fall to let us leav them to themselv
for a coupl of dai and then turn the shell with the open
downward the content flow out as easili as would soup from an
overturn saucepan when the sate diner retir from thi gruel
onli insignific leav remain
the matter is obviou by repeat tini bite similar to the tweak
which we saw distribut at the outset the flesh of the mollusc is
convert into a gruel on which the variou banquet nourish
themselv without distinct each work at the broth by mean of
some special pepsin and each take hi own mouth of it in
consequ of thi method which first convert the food into a
liquid the glowworm mouth must be veri feebli arm apart from the
two fang which sting the patient and inject the ansthet poison
and at the same time no doubt the serum capabl of turn the
solid flesh into fluid these two tini implement which can just be
examin through the len must it seem have some other object
thei ar hollow and in thi resembl those of the antlion which
suck and drain it captur without have to divid it but there is
thi great differ that the antlion leav copiou remnant
which ar afterward flung outsid the funnelshap trap dug in the
sand wherea the glowworm that expert liquefi leav noth or
next to noth with similar tool the on simpli suck the blood of
it prei and the other turn everi morsel of hi to account thank to
a preliminari liquefact
and thi is done with exquisit precis though the equilibrium is
sometim anyth but steadi my rearingglass suppli me with
magnific exampl crawl up the side the snail imprison in
my apparatu sometim reach the top which is close with a glass
pane and fix themselv to it by mean of a speck of glair thi is a
mere temporari halt in which the mollusc is miserli with it adhes
product and the merest shake is enough to loosen the shell and send
it to the bottom of the jar
now it is not unusu for the glowworm to hoist himself to the top
with the help of a certain climbingorgan that make up for hi weak
leg he select hi quarri make a minut inspect of it to find
an entranceslit nibbl it a littl render it insens and
without delai proce to prepar the gruel which he will consum for
dai on end
when he leav the tabl the shell is found to be absolut empti
and yet thi shell which wa fix to the glass by a veri faint
sticki ha not come loos ha not even shift it posit in
the smallest degre without ani protest from the hermit gradual
convert into broth it ha been drain on the veri spot at which
the first attack wa deliv these small detail tell us how
promptli the ansthet bite take effect thei teach us how
dexter the glowworm treat hi snail without caus him to fall
from a veri slipperi vertic support and without even shake him on
hi slight line of adhes
under these condit of equilibrium the oper short clumsi
leg ar obvious not enough a special accessori apparatu is need
to defi the danger of slip and to seiz the unseiz and thi
apparatu the lampyri possess at the hinder end of the anim we
see a white spot which the len separ into some dozen short
fleshi appendag sometim gather into a cluster sometim spread
into a rosett there is your organ of adhes and locomot if he
would fix himself somewher even on a veri smooth surfac such as a
grassstalk the glowworm open hi rosett and spread it wide on
the support to which it adher by it own sticki the same
organ rise and fall open and close doe much to assist
the act of progress in short the glowworm is a new sort of
selfpropel crippl who deck hi hindquart with a dainti
white rose a kind of hand with twelv finger not joint but
move in everi direct tubular finger which do not seiz but
stick
the same organ serv anoth purpos that of a toiletspong and
brush at a moment of rest after a meal the glowworm pass and
repass the said brush over hi head back side and hinderpart a
perform made possibl by the flexibl of hi spine thi is
done point by point from on end of the bodi to the other with a
scrupul persist that prove the great interest which he take
in the oper what is hi object in thu spong himself in
dust and polish himself so carefulli it is a question
appar of remov a few atom of dust or els some trace of
viscid that remain from the evil contact with the snail a wash and
brushup is not superflu when on leav the tub in which the
mollusc ha been treat
if the glowworm possess no other talent than that of chloroform
hi prei by mean of a few tweak resembl kiss he would be
unknown to the vulgar herd but he also know how to light himself
like a beacon he shine which is an excel manner of achiev
fame let us consid more particularli the femal who while
retain her larval shape becom marriag and glow at her best
dure the hottest part of summer the lightingapparatu occupi the
last three segment of the abdomen on each of the first two it take
the form on the ventral surfac of a wide belt cover almost the
whole of the arch on the third the lumin part is much less and
consist simpli of two small crescentshap mark or rather two
spot which shine through to the back and ar visibl both abov and
below the anim belt and spot emit a gloriou white light
delic ting with blue the gener light of the glowworm
thu compris two group first the wide belt of the two segment
preced the last secondli the two spot of the final segment the
two belt the exclus attribut of the marriag femal ar the
part richest in light to glorifi her wed the futur mother don
her brightest gaud she light her two resplend scarv but
befor that from the time of the hatch she had onli the modest
rushlight of the stern thi effloresc of light is the equival
of the final metamorphosi which is usual repres by the gift
of wing and flight it brillianc herald the pairingtim wing
and flight there will be none the femal retain her humbl larval
form but she kindl her blaze beacon
the male on hi side is fulli transform chang hi shape
acquir wing and wingcas nevertheless like the femal he
possess from the time when he is hatch the pale lamp of the end
segment thi lumin aspect of the stern is characterist of the
entir glowworm tribe independ of sex and season it appear
upon the bud grub and continu throughout life unchang and we
must not forget to add that it is visibl on the dorsal as well as on
the ventral surfac wherea the two larg belt peculiar to the
femal shine onli under the abdomen
my hand is not so steadi nor my sight so good as onc thei were but
as far as thei allow me i consult anatomi for the structur of the
lumin organ i take a scrap of the epidermi and manag to
separ pretti neatli half of on of the shine belt i place my
prepar under the microscop on the skin a sort of whitewash
li spread form of a veri fine granular substanc thi is
certainli the lightproduc matter to examin thi white layer more
close is beyond the power of my weari ey just besid it is a
curiou airtub whose short and remark wide stem branch
suddenli into a sort of bushi tuft of veri delic ramif
these creep over the lumin sheet or even dip into it that is all
the luminesc therefor is control by the respiratori organ
and the work produc is an oxid the white sheet suppli the
oxidiz matter and the thick airtub spread into a tufti bush
distribut the flow of air over it there remain the question of the
substanc whereof thi sheet is form the first suggest wa
phosphoru in the chemist sens of the word the glowworm ha been
calcin and treat with the violent reagent that bring the simpl
substanc to light but no on so far as i know ha obtain a
satisfactori answer along these line phosphoru seem to plai no
part here in spite of the name of phosphoresc which is sometim
bestow upon the glowworm gleam the answer li elsewher no on
know where
we ar better inform as regard anoth question ha the glowworm
a free control of the light which he emit can he turn it on or down
or put it out as he pleas ha he an opaqu screen which is drawn
over the flame at will or is that flame alwai left expos there is
no need for ani such mechan the insect ha someth better for
it revolv light
the thick tube suppli the lightproduc sheet increas the flow
of air and the light is intensifi the same airtub swai by the
anim will slacken or even suspend the passag of air and the
light grow fainter or even goe out it is in short the mechan
of a lamp which is regul by the access of air to the wick
excit can set the attend airduct in motion we must here
distinguish between two case that of the gorgeou scarv the
exclus ornament of the femal ripe for matrimoni and that of the
modest fairylamp on the last segment which both sex kindl at ani
ag in the second case the extinct caus by a flurri is sudden
and complet or nearli so in my nocturn hunt for young
glowworm measur about 5 millimetr long3 i can plainli see
the glimmer on the blade of grass but should the least fals step
disturb a neighbour twig the light goe out at onc and the
covet insect becom invis upon the fullgrown femal lit up
with their nuptial scarv even a violent start ha but a slight

accord to the number form the group there is no pictur of the

these ar the question that present themselv to my mind when for
the first time in 1855 i observ the fact which i have just
relat three year of assidu observ enabl me to add on of
it most astonish chapter to the stori of the format of
insect
after collect a fairli larg number of these enigmat shell
contain adult sitar i had the satisfact of observ at
leisur the emerg of the perfect insect from the shell the act
of pair and the lai of the egg the shell is easili broken a
few stroke of the mandibl distribut at random a few kick ar
enough to deliv the perfect insect from it fragil prison
in the glass jar in which i kept my sitar i saw the pair follow
veri close upon the first moment of freedom i even wit a
fact which show emphat how imperi in the perfect insect is
the need to perform without delai the act intend to ensur the
preserv of it race a femal with her head alreadi cut out of
the shell is anxious struggl to releas herself entir a
male who ha been free for a coupl of hour climb on the shell
and tug here and there with hi mandibl at the fragil
envelop strive to deliv the femal from her shackl hi effort
ar soon crown with success and though the femal is still three
part swath in her swaddlingband the coupl take place
immedi last about a minut dure the act the male remain
motionless on the top of the shell or on the top of the femal when
the latter is entir free i do not know whether in ordinari
circumst the male occasion thu help the femal to gain her
liberti to do so he would have to penetr into a cell contain a
femal which after all is not beyond hi power see that he ha
been abl to escap from hi own still on the actual site of the
cell the coupl is gener perform at the entranc to the
galleri of the anthophor and then neither of the sex drag about
with it the least shred of the shell from which it ha emerg
after mate the two sitar proce to clean their leg and antenn

the male cower in a crevic of the earthen bank linger for two or

egg which she doe without delai di at the entranc to the
corridor in which the egg ar laid thi is the origin of all those
corps swing in the spider web with which the neighbourhood of
the anthophora dwell is upholst
thu the sitar in the perfect state live long enough onli to mate
and to lai their egg i have never seen on save upon the scene of
their love which is also that of their death i have never surpris
on brows on the plant near at hand so that though thei ar

where thi exact spot is doe the femal go from cell to cell
confid an egg to the succul flank of each larva whether thi
larva belong to the anthophora or to a parasit of her as the
mysteri shell whenc the sitari emerg would inclin on to
believ thi method of lai the egg on at a time in each cell
would appear to be essenti if we ar to explain the fact alreadi
ascertain but then why do the cell usurp by the sitar retain
not the slightest trace of the forcibl entri which is indispens
and how is it that in spite of lengthi investig dure which my

upon all these mysteri how is it i sai that i have never come

noth new happen befor the end of the follow april i shall
profit by thi long period of repos to tell you more about the young
larva of which i will begin by give a descript it length is a
twentyfifth of an inch or a littl less it is hard as leather a
glossi greenish black convex abov and flat below long and slender
with a diamet increas gradual from the head to the hinder
extrem of the metathorax after which it rapidli diminish it
head is a trifl longer than it is wide and is slightli dilat at the
base it is paler near the mouth and darker about the ocelli
the labrum form a segment of a circl it is reddish edg with a
small number of veri short stiff hair the mandibl ar power
redbrown curv and sharp when at rest thei meet without cross
the maxillari palpi ar rather long consist of two cylindr
section of equal length the outer end in a veri short bristl
the jaw and the lower lip ar not suffici visibl to lend
themselv to accur descript
the antenn consist of two cylindr segment equal in length not
veri definit divid these segment ar nearli as long as those of
the palpi the outer is surmount by a cirru whose length is as much
as thrice that of the head and taper off until it becom invis
under a power pocketlen behind the base of either antenn ar
two ocelli unequ in size and almost touch
the thorac segment ar of equal length and increas gradual in
width from front to back the prothorax is wider than the head but is
narrow in front than at the base and is slightli round at the
side the leg ar of medium length and fairli robust end in a
long power sharp and veri mobil claw on the haunch and thigh of
each leg is a long cirru like that of the antenn almost as long as
the whole limb and stand at right angl to the plane of locomot
when the creatur move there ar a few stiff bristl on the leg
the abdomen ha nine segment of practic equal length but
shorter than those of the thorax and diminish veri rapidli in width
toward the last fix below the eighth segment or rather below the
strip of membran separ thi segment and the last we see two
spike slightli curv short but with strong sharp hard point
and place on to the right and the other to the left of the median
line these two appendag ar abl by mean of a mechan
recal on a smaller scale that of the snail horn to withdraw
into themselv as a result of the membran charact of their
base thei can also retreat under the eighth segment born as thei
ar by the anal segment when thi last as it contract withdraw
into the eighth lastli the ninth or anal segment bear on it hinder
edg two long cirri like those of the leg and the antenn curv
backward from tip to base at the rear of thi segment a fleshi
nippl appear more or less promin thi is the anu i do not
know where the stigmata ar place thei have evad my
investig though these were undertaken with the aid of the
microscop
when the larva is at rest the variou segment overlap evenli and
the membran interv correspond with the articul do not
show but when the larva walk all the articul especi
those of the abdomin segment ar distend and end by occupi
almost as much space as the horni arch at the same time the anal
segment emerg from the sheath form by the eighth the anu in
turn is stretch into a nippl and the two point of the
penultim ring rise at first slowli and then suddenli stand up
with an abrupt motion similar to that of a spring when releas in
the end these two point diverg like the horn of a crescent onc
thi complex apparatu is unfold the tini creatur is readi to
crawl upon the most slipperi surfac
the last segment and it anal button ar curv at right angl to the
axi of the bodi and the anu come and press upon the surfac of
locomot where it eject a tini drop of transpar treacli fluid
which glue and hold the littl creatur firmli in posit
support on a sort of tripod form by the anal button and the two
cirri of the last segment if we ar observ the anim manner of
locomot on a strip of glass we can hold the strip in a vertic
posit or even turn it upsid down or shake it lightli without
caus the larva to becom detach and fall held fast as it is by
the glutin secret of the anal button
if it ha to proce along a surfac where there is no danger of a
fall the microscop creatur emploi anoth method it crook it
belli and when the two spike of the eighth segment now fulli
outspread have found a firm support by plough so to speak the
surfac of locomot it bear upon that base and push forward by
expand the variou abdomin articul thi forward movement
is also assist by the action of the leg which ar far from
remain inact thi done it cast anchor with the power claw
of it feet the abdomen contract the variou segment draw
togeth and the anu pull forward obtain a fresh purchas with
the aid of the two spike befor begin the second of these
curiou stride
dure these manoeuvr the cirri of the flank and thigh drag along
the support surfac and by their length and elast appear
fit onli to imped progress but let us not be in a hurri to
conclud that we have discov an inconsist the least of
creatur is adapt to the condit amid which it ha to live
there is reason to believ that these filament far from hamper
the pigmi progress must in normal circumst be of some
assist to it
even the littl that we have just learnt show us that the young
sitarislarva is not call upon to move on an ordinari surfac the
spot whatev it mai be like where thi larva is to live later
expos it to the risk of mani danger fall sinc in order to
prevent them it is not onli equip with strong and extrem mobil
talon and a steelshod crescent a sort of ploughshar capabl of
bite into the most highli polish substanc but is further
provid with a viscou liquid suffici tenaci and adhes to
hold it in posit without the help of other applianc in vain i
rack my brain to guess what the substanc might be so shift so
uncertain and so peril which the young sitar ar destin to
inhabit and i discov noth to explain the necess for the
structur which i have describ convinc beforehand by an
attent examin of thi structur that i should wit some
peculiar habit i wait with eager impati for the return of the
warm weather never doubt that by dint of persev observ
the mysteri would be disclos to me next spring at last thi spring
so fervent desir arriv i brought to bear all the patienc all
the imagin all the insight and discern that i mai possess
but to my utter shame and still greater regret the secret escap
me oh how pain ar those tortur of indecis when on ha to
postpon till the follow year an investig which ha led to no

my observ made dure the spring of 1856 although pure
neg nevertheless have an interest of their own becaus thei
prove the inaccuraci of certain supposit to which the undeni
parasit of the sitar natur inclin us i will therefor
relat them in a few word at the end of april the young larv
hitherto motionless and conceal in the spongi heap of the eggskin
emerg from their immobl scatter and run about in all direct
through the box and jar in which thei have pass the winter by
their hurri gait and their indefatig evolut we readili guess
that thei ar seek someth which thei lack what can thi
someth be unless it be food for rememb that these larv were
hatch at the end of septemb and that sinc then that is to sai
for seven long month thei have taken no nourish though thei
have spent thi period in the full enjoy of their vital as i
wa abl to assur myself all through the winter by irrit them
and not in a state of torpor similar to that of the hibern
anim from the moment of their hatch thei ar doom although
full of life to an absolut abstin of seven month durat and
it is natur to suppos when we see their present excit that
an imperi hunger set them bustl in thi fashion
the desir nourish could onli be the content of the cell of the
anthophora sinc we afterward find the sitar in these cell now
these content ar limit to honei or larv it just happen that i
have kept some anthophoracel occupi by larv or nymph i place a
few of these some open some close within reach of the young
sitar as i had alreadi done directli after the hatch i even
slip the sitar into the cell i place them on the side of the

continu fruitless i remain convinc that my famish grub ar

let us now try honei we must obvious emploi honei prepar by the
same speci of anthophora as that at whose cost the sitar live but
thi bee is not veri common in the neighbourhood of avignon and my

oilbeetl in the cell of the same anthophora that nourish the
sitar could there be a similar of habit between the two kind
of insect thi idea threw a sudden light for me upon the subject
but i had plenti of time in which to matur my plan i had anoth
year to wait

when april came my sitarislarv began as usual to bestir
themselv the first bee to appear an osmia is drop aliv into a
glass jar contain a few of these larv and after a laps of some
fifteen minut i inspect them through the pocketlen five sitar
ar embed in the fleec of the thorax it is done the problem
solv the larv of the sitar like those of the oilbeetl cling
like grim death to the fleec of their gener host and make him
carri them into the cell ten time over i repeat the experi with
the variou bee that come to plunder the lilac flower outsid my
window and in particular with male anthophor the result is still the
same the larv emb themselv in the hair of the bee thorax but
after so mani disappoint on becom distrust and it is better
to go and observ the fact upon the spot besid the easter
holidai fall veri conveni and afford me the leisur for my
observ
i will admit that my heart wa beat a littl faster than usual when
i found myself onc again stand in front of the perpendicular bank
in which the anthophora nest what will be the result of the
experi will it onc more cover me with confus the weather is
cold and raini not a bee show herself on the few spring flower that
have come out number of anthophor cower numb and motionless at
the entranc to the galleri with the tweezer i extract them on
by on from their lurkingplac to examin them under the len the
first ha sitarislarv on her thorax so ha the second the third
and fourth likewis and so on as far as i care to pursu the
examin i chang galleri ten time twenti time the result is
invari then for me occur on of the moment which come to
those who after consid and reconsid an idea for year and
year from everi point of view ar at last abl to cry eureka
on the dai that follow a seren and balmi sky enabl the
anthophor to leav their retreat and scatter over the countrysid
and despoil the flower i renew my examin on those anthophor
fly incessantli from on flower to anoth whether in the
neighbourhood of the place where thei were born or at great distanc
from these place some were without sitarislarv other more
numer had two three four five or more among the hair of their
thorax at avignon where i have not yet seen sitari humerali the
same speci of anthophora observ at almost the same season while
pillag the lilacblossom wa alwai free of young sitarisgrub
at carpentra on the contrari where there is not a singl
anthophoracoloni without sitar nearli threequart of the
specimen which i examin carri a few of these larv in their
fleec
but on the other hand if we look for these larv in the
entrancelobbi where we found them a few dai ago pile up in
heap we no longer see them consequ when the anthophor
have open their cell enter the galleri to reach the exit and
fly awai or els when the bad weather and the dark bring them
back there for a time the young sitarislarv kept on the alert in
these same galleri by the stimulu of instinct attach themselv to
the bee wriggl into their fur and clutch it so firmli that
thei need not fear a fall dure the long journei of the insect which
carri them by thu attach themselv to the anthophor the young
sitar evid intend to get themselv carri at the opportun
moment into the victual cell
on might even at first sight believ that thei live for some time on
the anthophora bodi just as the ordinari parasit the variou
speci of lice live on the bodi of the anim that feed them but
not at all the young sitar embed in the fleec at right angl
to the anthophora bodi head inward rump outward do not stir
from the point which thei have select a point near the bee
shoulder we do not see them wander from spot to spot explor
the anthophora bodi seek the part where the skin is more
delic as thei would certainli do if thei were realli deriv some
nourish from the juic of the bee on the contrari thei ar
nearli alwai establish on the toughest and hardest part of the
bee bodi on the thorax a littl below the insert of the wing
or more rare on the head and thei remain absolut motionless
fix to the same hair by mean of the mandibl the feet the
close crescent of the eighth segment and lastli the glue of the
anal button if thei chanc to be disturb in thi posit thei
reluctantli repair to anoth point of the thorax push their wai
through the insect fur and in the end fasten on to anoth hair
as befor
to confirm my convict that the young sitarisgrub do not feed on
the anthophora bodi i have sometim place within their reach in
a glass jar some bee that have long been dead and ar complet
dri up on these dry corps fit at most for gnaw but certainli
contain noth to suck the sitarislarv took up their customari
posit and there remain motionless as on the live insect thei
obtain noth therefor from the anthophora bodi but perhap
thei nibbl her fleec even as the birdlic nibbl the bird
feather
to do thi thei would requir mouthpart endow with a certain
strength and in particular horni and sturdi jaw wherea their jaw
ar so fine that a microscop examin fail to show them to me
the larv it is true ar provid with power mandibl but these
finelypoint mandibl with their backward curv though excel
for tug at food and tear it to piec ar useless for grind
it or gnaw it lastli we have a final proof of the passiv
condit of the sitarislarv on the bodi of the anthophor in the
fact that the bee do not appear to be in ani wai incommod by their
presenc sinc we do not see them try to rid themselv of the
grub some anthophor which were free from these grub and some
other which were carri five or six upon their bodi were place
separ in glass jar when the first disturb result from
their captiv wa appeas i could see noth peculiar about those
occupi by the young sitar and if all these argument were not
suffici i might add that a creatur which ha alreadi been abl to
spend seven month without food and which in a few dai time will
proce to drink a highlyflavour fluid would be guilti of a
singular inconsist if it were to start nibbl the dry fleec of
a bee it therefor seem to me undeni that the young sitar
settl on the anthophora bodi mere to make her carri them into the
cell which she will soon be build
but until then the futur parasit must hold tight to the fleec of
their hostess despit her rapid evolut among the flower despit
her rub against the wall of the galleri when she enter to take
shelter and abov all despit the brush which she must often give
herself with her feet to dust herself and keep spick and span henc
no doubt the need for that curiou apparatu which no stand or
move upon ordinari surfac could explain as wa said abov when
we were wonder what the shift swai danger bodi might be
on which the larva would have to establish itself later thi bodi is
a hair of a bee who make a thousand rapid journei now dive into
her narrow galleri now forc her wai down the tight throat of a
corolla and who never rest except to brush herself with her feet and
remov the speck of dust collect by the down which cover her
we can now easili understand the us of the project crescent whose
two horn by close togeth ar abl to take hold of a hair more
easili than the most delic tweezer we perceiv the full valu of
the tenaci adhes provid by the anu to save the tini creatur
at the least sign of danger from an immin fall we realiz lastli
the us function that mai be fulfil by the elast cirri of the
flank and leg which ar an absolut and most embarrass
superflu when walk upon a smooth surfac but which in the
present case penetr like so mani probe into the thick of the
anthophora down and serv as it were to anchor the sitarislarva in
posit the more we consid thi arrang which seem model
by a blind capric so long as the grub drag itself labori over a
smooth surfac the more do we marvel at the mean as effect as
thei ar vari which ar lavish upon thi fragil creatur to help
it to preserv it unstabl equilibrium
befor i describ what becom of the sitarisgrub on leav the
bodi of the anthophor i must not omit to mention on veri remark
peculiar all the bee invad by these grub that have hitherto
been observ have without on except been male anthophor those
whom i drew from their lurkingplac were male those whom i caught
upon the flower were male and in spite of the most activ search
i fail to find a singl femal at liberti the caus of thi total
absenc of femal is easi to understand
if we remov a few clod from the area occupi by the nest we see
that though all the male have alreadi open and abandon their
cell the femal on the contrari ar still enclos in their but
on the point of soon take flight thi appear of the male
almost a month befor the emerg of the femal is not peculiar to
the anthophor i have observ it in mani other bee and particularli
in the threehorn osmia o tricorni who inhabit the same site
as the hairyfoot anthophora a pilip the male of the osmia
make their appear even befor those of the anthophora and at so
earli a season that the young sitarislarv ar perhap not yet
arous by the instinct impuls which urg them to activ it is
no doubt to their precoci awaken that the male of the osmia ow
their abil to travers with impun the corridor in which the
young sitarisgrub ar heap togeth without have the latter
fasten to their fleec at least i cannot otherwis explain the
absenc of these larv from the back of the male osmi sinc when
we place them artifici in the presenc of these bee thei fasten
on them as readili as on the anthophor
the emerg from the common site begun by the male osmi is
continu by the male anthophor and end with the almost simultan
emerg of the femal osmi and anthophor i wa easili abl to
verifi thi sequenc by observ at my own place in the earli
spring the date at which the cell collect dure the previou
autumn were broken
at the moment of their emerg the male anthophor pass through
the galleri in which the sitarislarv ar wait on the alert
must pick up a certain number of them and those among them who by
enter empti corridor escap the enemi on thi first occas will
not evad him for long for the rain the chilli air and the dark
bring them back to their former home where thei take shelter now in
on galleri now in anoth dure a great part of april thi
constant traffic of the male in the entrancelobbi of their hous
and the prolong stai which the bad weather often compel them to
make provid the sitar with the most favour opportun for
slip into the bee fur and take up their posit moreov
when thi state of affair ha last a month or so there can be onli
veri few if ani larv left wander about without have attain
their end at that period i wa unabl to find them anywher save on
the bodi of the male anthophora
it is therefor extrem probabl that on their emerg which
take place as mai draw near the femal anthophor do not pick up
sitarislarv in the corridor or pick up onli a number which will
not compar with that carri by the male in fact the first femal
that i wa abl to observ in april in the actual neighbourhood of
the nest were free from these larv nevertheless it is upon the
femal that the sitarislarv must final establish themselv for
the male upon whom thei now ar cannot introduc them into the cell
sinc thei take no part in the build or provis there is
therefor at a given moment a transfer of sitarislarv from the
male anthophor to the femal and thi transfer is beyond a doubt
effect dure the union of the sex the femal find in the male
embrac both life and death for her offspr at the moment when she
surrend herself to the male for the preserv of her race the
vigil parasit pass from the male to the femal with the
extermin of that same race in view
in support of these deduct here is a fairli conclus
experi though it reproduc the natur circumst but
roughli on a femal taken in her cell and therefor free from
sitar i place a male who is infest with them and i keep the two
sex in contact suppress their unruli movement as far as i am
abl after fifteen or twenti minut of thi enforc proxim the
femal is invad by on or more of the larv which at first were on
the male true experi doe not alwai succe under these
imperfect condit
by watch at avignon the few anthophor that i succeed in
discov i wa abl to detect the precis moment of their work
and on the follow thursday5 the 21st of mai i repair in all
hast to carpentra to wit if possibl the entranc of the
sitar into the bee cell i wa not mistaken the work were in
full swing
footnot 5 thursdai is the weekli holidai in french
schoolstransl note
in front of a high expans of earth a swarm stimul by the sun
which flood it with light and heat is danc a crazi ballet it is
a hover of anthophor a few feet thick and cover an area which
match the sort of housefront form by the perpendicular soil from

thousand of anthophor ar incessantli fly off and scatter over

i wa at that time someth of a novic as regard the natur of

woe said i to myself woe to the reckless wight bold enough to

at thi thought render still more alarm by the recollect of
certain misadventur of which i had been the victim when seek to

yet to obtain light upon the question which bring me hither i must

perhap all dai watch the work which i intend to upset len in

investig which i have to make no matter even though i leav
thi waspsnest with a face swollen beyond recognit i must todai
obtain a decis solut of the problem which ha preoccupi me too
long
a few stroke of the net aim beyond the limit of the swarm at

me that the sitarislarv ar perch on the thorax as i expect
occupi the same posit as on the male the circumst
therefor could not be more favour we will inspect the cell
without further delai
my prepar ar made at onc i button my cloth tightli so as
to afford the bee the least possibl opportun and i enter the
heart of the swarm a few blow of the mattock which arous a far

greatli astonish to find myself still safe and sound and unpursu

for the moment a second expedit is made last longer than the

my miscellan impedimenta spread over the ground box glass jar
and tube tweezer and magnifyingglass were certainli regard by
these good peopl as the implement of my wizardri
we will now proce to examin the cell some ar still open and
contain onli a more or less complet store of honei other ar
hermet seal with an earthen lid the content of these latter
vari greatli sometim we find the larva of a bee which ha finish
it mess or is on the point of finish it sometim a larva white
like the first but more corpul and of a differ shape at other
time honei with an egg float on the surfac the honei is liquid
and sticki with a brownish colour and a veri strong repuls smell
the egg is of a beauti white cylindr in shape slightli curv
into an arc a fifth or a sixth of an inch in length and not quit a
twentyfifth of an inch in thick it is the egg of the anthophora
in a few cell thi egg is float all alon on the surfac of the
honei in other veri numer these we see ly on the egg of the
anthophora as on a sort of raft a young sitarisgrub with the shape
and the dimens which i have describ abov that is to sai with
the shape and the dimens which the creatur possess on leav
the egg thi is the enemi within the gate
when and how did it get in in none of the cell where i have observ
it wa i abl to distinguish a fissur which could have allow it to
enter thei ar all seal in a quit irreproach manner the
parasit therefor establish itself in the honeywarehous befor
the warehous wa close on the other hand the open cell full of
honei but as yet without the egg of the anthophora ar alwai free
from parasit it is therefor dure the lai or afterward when
the anthophora is occupi in plaster the door of the cell that
the young larva gain admitt it is imposs to decid by
experi to which of these two period we must ascrib the
introduct of the sitar into the cell for howev peaceabl the
anthophora mai be it is evid that we cannot hope to wit what
happen in the cell at the moment when she is lai an egg or at the
moment when she is make the lid but a few attempt will soon
convinc us that the onli second which would allow the sitari to
establish itself in the home of the bee is the veri second when the
egg is laid on the surfac of the honei
let us take an anthophoracel full of honei and furnish with an egg
and after remov the lid place it in a glass tube with a few
sitarisgrub the grub do not appear at all eager for thi wealth of
nectar place within their reach thei wander at random about the
tube run about the outsid of the cell sometim happen upon the
edg of the orific and veri rare ventur insid when thei do thei
do not go far in and thei come out again at onc if on happen to
reach the honei which onli half fill the cell it tri to escap as
soon as it ha perceiv the shift natur of the sticki soil upon
which it wa about to enter but totter at everi step becaus of
the viscou matter cling to it feet it often end by fall back
into the honei where it di of suffoc
again we mai experi as follow have prepar a cell as befor
we place a larva most carefulli on it inner wall or els on the
surfac of the food itself in the first case the larva hasten to
leav the cell in the second case it struggl awhil on the surfac
of the honei and end by get so complet caught that after a
thousand effort to gain the shore it is swallow up in the viscou
lake
in short all attempt to establish the sitarisgrub in an
anthophoracel provis with honei and furnish with an egg ar
no more success than those which i made with cell whose store of
food had alreadi been broach by the larva of the bee as describ
abov it is therefor certain that the sitarisgrub doe not leav
the fleec of the masonbe when the bee is in her cell or at the
entranc to it in order itself to make a rush for the covet honei
for thi honei would inevit caus it death if it happen by
accid to touch the peril surfac mere with the tip of it
tarsi
sinc we cannot admit that the sitarisgrub leav the furri corselet
of it hostess to slip unseen into the cell whose orific is not yet
wholli wall up at the moment when the anthophora is build her
door all that remain to investig is the second at which the egg
is be laid rememb in the first place that the young sitari
which we find in a close cell is alwai place on the egg of the bee
we shall see in a minut that thi egg not mere serv as a raft for
the tini creatur float on a veri treacher lake but also
constitut the first and indispens part of it diet to get at
thi egg situat in the centr of the lake of honei to reach at
all cost thi raft which is also it first ration the young larva
evid possess some mean of avoid the fatal contact of the
honei and thi mean can be provid onli by the action of the bee
herself
in the second place observ repeat ad nauseam have shown me
that at no period do we find in each invad cell more than a singl
sitari in on or other of the form which it success assum
yet there ar sever young larv establish in the silki tangl of
the bee thorax all eagerli watch for the propiti moment at
which to enter the dwell in which thei ar to continu their
develop how then doe it happen that these larv goad by such
an appetit as on would expect after seven or eight month complet
abstin instead of all rush togeth into the first cell within
reach on the contrari enter the variou cell which the bee is
provis on at a time and in perfect order some action must take
place here independ of the sitar
to satisfi those two indispens condit the arriv of the
larva upon the egg without cross the honei and the introduct of
a singl larva among all those wait in the fleec of the bee there
can be onli on explan which is to suppos that at the moment
when the anthophora egg is half out of the oviduct on of the
sitar which have hasten from the thorax to the tip of the abdomen
on more highli favour by it posit instantli settl upon the
egg a bridg too narrow for two and with it reach the surfac of
the honei the imposs of otherwis fulfil the two
condit which i have state give to the explan which i am
offer a degre of certainti almost equival to that which would
be furnish by direct observ which is here unfortun
impractic thi presuppos it is true in the microscop littl
creatur destin to live in a place where so mani danger threaten it
from the first an astonishingli ration inspir which adapt
the mean to the end with amaz logic but is not thi the
invari conclus to which the studi of instinct alwai lead us
when drop her egg upon the honei therefor the anthophora at the
same time deposit in her cell the mortal enemi of her race she
carefulli plaster the lid which close the entranc to the cell and
all is done a second cell is built besid it probabl to suffer the
same fatal doom and so on until the more or less numer parasit
shelter by her down ar all accommod let us leav the unhappi
mother to continu her fruitless task and turn our attent to the
young larva which ha so adroitli secur itself board and lodg
in open cell whose lid is still moist we end by discov on
in which the egg recent laid support a young sitari thi egg is
intact and in irreproach condit but now the work of
devast begin the larva a tini black speck which we see run
over the white surfac of the egg at last stop and balanc itself
firmli on it six leg then seiz the delic skin of the egg
with the sharp hook of it mandibl it tug at it violent until
it break spill it content which the larva eagerli drink up
thu the first stroke of the mandibl which the parasit deliv in
the usurp cell is aim at the destruct of the bee egg a
highli logic precaut the sitarislarva as we shall see ha to
feed upon the honei in the cell the anthophoralarva which would
proce from that egg would requir the same food but the portion is
too small for two so quick a bite at the egg and the difficulti
will be remov the stori of these fact call for no comment thi
destruct of the cumbersom egg is all the more inevit inasmuch
as special tast compel the young sitarisgrub to make it first
meal of it inde we see the tini creatur begin by greedili
drink the juic which the torn wrapper of the egg allow to
escap and for sever dai it mai be observ at on time
motionless on thi envelop in which it rummag at interv with
it head at other run over it from end to end to rip it open
still wider and to caus a littl of the juic which becom daili
less abund to trickl from it but we never catch it imbib the
honei which surround it on everi side
for that matter it is easi to convinc ourselv that the egg
combin with the function of a lifebuoi that of the first ration i
have laid on the surfac of the honei in a cell a tini strip of paper
of the same dimens as the egg and on thi raft i have place a
sitarislarva despit everi care my attempt mani time repeat
alwai fail the larva place in a paper boat in the centr of the
mass of honei behav as in the earlier experi not find what
suit it it tri to escap and perish in the sticki toil as soon
as it leav the strip of paper which it soon doe
on the other hand we can easili rear sitarisgrub by take
anthophoracel not invad by the parasit cell in which the egg
is not yet hatch all that we have to do is to pick up on of these
grub with the moisten tip of a needl and to lai it delic on
the egg there is then no longer the least attempt to escap after
explor the egg to find it wai about the larva rip it open and
for sever dai doe not stir from the spot henceforth it
develop take place unhind provid that the cell be
protect from too rapid evapor which would dry up the honei and
render it unfit for the grub food the anthophora egg therefor is
absolut necessari to the sitarislarva not mere as a boat but
also as it first nourish thi is the whole secret for lack of
know which i had hitherto fail in my attempt to rear the larv
hatch in my glass jar
at the end of a week the egg drain by the parasit is noth but
a dry skin the first meal is finish the sitarislarva whose
dimens have almost doubl now split open along the back and
through a slit which compris the head and the three thorac
segment a white corpusculum the second form of thi singular
organ escap to fall on the surfac of the honei while the
abandon slough remain cling to the raft which ha hitherto
safeguard and fed the larva present both slough those of the
sitari and the egg will disappear submerg under the wave of
honei which the new larva is about to rais here end the histori of
the first form adopt by the sitari
in sum up the abov we see that the strang littl creatur
await without food for seven month the appear of the
anthophor and at last fasten on to the hair on the corselet of the
male who ar the first to emerg and who inevit pass within it
reach in go through their corridor from the fleec of the male
the larva move three or four week later to that of the femal at
the moment of coupl and then from the femal to the egg leav
the oviduct it is by thi concaten of complex manoeuvr that
the larva in the end find itself perch upon an egg in the middl of
a close cell fill with honei these peril gymnast on the hair
of a bee in movement all the dai thi pass from on sex to the
other thi arriv in the middl of the cell by wai of the egg a
danger bridg thrown across the sticki abyss all thi necessit
the balancingappli with which it is provid and which i have
describ abov lastli the destruct of the egg call in it
turn for a sharp pair of scissor and such is the object of the
keen curv mandibl thu the primari form of the sitar ha as
it function to get itself carri by the anthophora into the cell and
to rip up her egg thi done the organ becom transform to such
a degre that repeat observ ar requir to make us believ
the evid of our ey

numer swarm of anthophor who more industri than their

bastion in the form of an arch cylind in a word thei ar swarm
of a parietina a spars carpet of turf extend from the edg of
the road to the foot of the bank the more comfort to follow the
work of the bee in the hope of wrest some secret from them i had
been ly for a few moment upon thi turf in the veri heart of the
inoffens swarm when my cloth were invad by legion of littl
yellow lice run with desper eager through the hairi
thicket of the nap of the cloth in these tini creatur with which
i wa powder here and there as with yellow dust i soon recogn
an old acquaint the young oilbeetl whom i now saw for the
first time elsewher than in the bee fur or the interior of their
cell i could not lose so excel an opportun of learn how
these larv manag to establish themselv upon the bodi of their
fosterpar
in the grass where after ly down for a moment i had caught these
lice were a few plant in blossom of which the most abund were
three composit hedypnoi polymorpha senecio gallicu and
anthemi arvensi now it wa on a composit a dandelion that
newport seem to rememb see some young oilbeetl and my
attent therefor wa first of all direct to the plant which i
have name to my great satisfact nearli all the flower of these
three plant especi those of the camomil anthemi were
occupi by young oilbeetl in greater or lesser number on on
head of camomil i count forti of these tini insect cower
motionless in the centr of the floret on the other hand i could
not discov ani on the flower of the poppi or of a wild rocket
diplotaxi murali which grew promiscu among the plant
aforesaid it seem to me therefor that it is onli on the composit
flower that the meloelarv await the bee arriv
in addit to thi popul encamp upon the head of the
composit and remain motionless as though it had achiev it

though the green carpet wa continu for a consider distanc
along the side of the road i could not detect a singl meloelarva
elsewher than in the few squar yard ly in front of the bank

far to find themselv near the anthophor thei had had no long
pilgrimag to make for there wa not a sign of the inevit

so long as noth unusu happen upon the flower so long as no
sudden shock announc the arriv of a strang visitor the melo
remain absolut motionless and give no sign of life to see them
dip vertic head downward into the floret on might
suppos that thei were seek some sweet liquid their food but in
that case thei ought to pass more frequent from on floret to
anoth which thei do not except when after a fals alarm thei
regain their hidingplac and choos the spot which seem to them the
most favour thi immobl mean that the floret of the
camomil serv them onli as a place of ambush even as later the
anthophora bodi will serv them sole as a vehicl to convei them
to the bee cell thei take no nourish either on the flower or
on the bee and as with the sitar their first meal will consist
of the anthophora egg which the hook of their mandibl ar
intend to rip open
their immobl is as we have said complet but noth is easier
than to arous their suspend activ shake a camomileblossom

to touch an object out of their reach if noth offer for them to

but if we place near them ani object whatev thei do not fail to

anyth in their eager to quit the provision shelter of the
flower it is true that after find themselv on these inanim

their bustl movement to and fro and their tendenc to go back to
the flower if there still be time those which have thu giddili flung
themselv upon a bit of straw and ar allow to return to their
flower do not readili fall a second time into the same trap there is
therefor in these anim speck a memori an experi of

after these experi i tri other with hairi materi imit
more or less close the down of the bee with littl piec of cloth
or velvet cut from my cloth with plug of cotton wool with pellet
of flock gather from the everlast upon all these object
offer with the tweezer the melo flung themselv without ani
difficulti but instead of keep quiet as thei do on the bodi of
the bee thei soon convinc me by their restless behaviour that
thei found themselv as much out of their element on these furri
materi as on the smooth surfac of a bit of straw i ought to have
expect thi had i not just seen them wander without paus upon
the everlast envelop with cottoni flock if reach the shelter
of a downi surfac were enough to make them believ themselv safe in

let us now offer them live insect and first of all anthophor if

by melo cling to her hair the larv nimbl take up their

after the anthophor i tri the first live insect that i wa abl

what is more there wa no attempt made to return to the flower as i

for instanc with a dronefli and i did in fact at a later date
find some meloelarv on the bodi of a big beetl the golden
rosechaf cetonia aurata an assidu visitor of the flower
after exhaust the insect class i put within their reach my last
resourc a larg black spider without hesit thei pass from

suit their plan for leav the provision abod where thei ar
wait without distinct of speci genu or class thei fasten
to the first live creatur that chanc bring within their reach we
now understand how it is that these young larv have been observ
upon a host of differ insect and especi upon the earli fli
and bee pillag the flower we can also understand the need for
that prodigi number of egg laid by a singl oilbeetl sinc the
vast major of the larv which come out of them will infal go
astrai and will not succe in reach the cell of the anthophor
instinct is at fault here and fecund make up for it
but instinct recov it infal in anoth case the melo
as we have seen pass without difficulti from the flower to the
object within their reach whatev these mai be smooth or hairi
live or inanim thi done thei behav veri differ
accord as thei have chanc to invad the bodi of an insect or some

how then do thei recogn the natur of the object to which thei have

surfac will sometim suit them and sometim not do thei judg
their new lodg by sight but then no mistak would be possibl the
sens of sight would tell them at the outset whether the object within
reach wa suitabl or not and emigr would or would not take
place accord to it decis and then how can we suppos that
buri in the dens thicket of a pellet of cottonwool or in the
fleec of an anthophora the impercept larva can recogn by
sight the enorm mass which it is perambul
is it by touch by some sensat due to the inner vibrat of
live flesh not so for the melo remain motionless on insect
corps that have dri up complet on dead anthophor taken from
cell at least a year old i have seen them keep absolut quiet on
fragment of an anthophora on a thorax long sinc nibbl and empti
by the mite by what sens then can thei distinguish the thorax of an
anthophora from a velveti pellet when sight and touch ar out of the
question the sens of smell remain but in that case what exquisit
subtleti must we not take for grant moreov what similar of
smell can we admit between all the insect which dead or aliv whole

after the observ which i have describ it remain for me to

i had to give it all up my thursdai wa draw to a close i had to
return to avignon to resum my lesson on the electrophoru and the
toricellian tube o happi thursdai what gloriou opportun i
lost becaus you were too short
we will go back a year to continu thi histori i collect under
far less favour condit it is true enough note to map out
the biographi of the tini creatur which we have just seen migrat
from the camomileflow to the anthophora back from what i have
said of the sitarislarv it is plain that the meloelarv perch
like the former on the back of a bee have but on aim to get
themselv convei by thi bee to the victual cell their object
is not to live for a time on the bodi that carri them
were it necessari to prove thi it would be enough to sai that we
never see these larv attempt to pierc the skin of the bee or els
to nibbl at a hair or two nor do we see them increas in size so
long as thei ar on the bee bodi to the melo as to the sitar
the anthophora serv mere as a vehicl which convei them to their
goal the victual cell
it remain for us to learn how the melo leav the down of the bee
which ha carri it in order to enter the cell with larv collect
from the bodi of differ bee befor i wa fulli acquaint with
the tactic of the sitar i undertook as newport had done befor
me certain investig intend to throw light on thi lead
point in the oilbeetl histori my attempt base upon those which
i had made with the sitar result in the same failur the tini
creatur when brought into contact with anthophoralarv or nymph
paid no attent whatev to their prei other place near cell
which were open and full of honei did not enter them or at most
ventur to the edg of the orific other lastli put insid the
cell on the dry wall or on the surfac of the honei came out again
immedi or els got stuck and di the touch of the honei is as
fatal to them as to the young sitar
search made at variou period in the nest of the hairyfoot
anthophora had taught me some year earlier that melo cicatricosu
like the sitar is a parasit of that bee inde i had at differ
time discov adult melo dead and shrivel in the bee
cell on the other hand i knew from lon dufour that the littl
yellow anim the lous found in the bee down had been recogn
thank to newport investig as the larva of the oilbeetl
with these data render still more strike by what i wa learn
daili on the subject of the sitar i went to carpentra on the 21st
of mai to inspect the nest of the anthophor then build as i
have describ though i wa almost certain of succeed sooner or
later with the sitar who were excess abund i had veri
littl hope of the melo which on the contrari ar veri scarc in
the same nest circumst howev favour me more than i dare
hope and after six hour labour in which the pick plai a great
part i becam the possessor by the sweat of my brow of a
consider number of cell occupi by sitar and two other cell
appropri by melo
while my enthusiasm had not had time to cool at the sight momentarili
repeat of a young sitari perch upon an anthophora egg float
in the centr of the littl pool of honei it might well have burst
all restraint on behold the content of on of these cell on the
black liquid honei a wrinkl pellicl is float and on thi
pellicl motionless is a yellow lous the pellicl is the empti
envelop of the anthophora egg the lous is a meloelarva
the stori of thi larva becom selfevid the young melo leav
the down of the bee at the moment when the egg is laid and sinc
contact with the honei would be fatal to the grub it must in order
to save itself adopt the tactic follow by the sitari that is to
sai it must allow itself to drop on the surfac of the honei with the
egg which is in the act of be laid there it first task is to
devour the egg which serv it for a raft as is attest by the empti
envelop on which it still remain and it is after thi meal the
onli on that it take so long as it retain it present form that it
must commenc it long seri of transform and feed upon the
honei amass by the anthophora thi wa the reason of the complet
failur both of my attempt and of newport to rear the young
meloelarv instead of offer them honei or larv or nymph we
should have place them on the egg recent laid by the anthophora
on my return from carpentra i meant to try thi method togeth
with that of the sitar with which i had been so success but as
i had no meloelarv at my dispos and could not obtain ani save by
search for them in the bee fleec the anthophoraegg were all
discov to have hatch in the cell which i brought back from my
expedit when i wa at last abl to find some thi lost experi
is littl to be regret for sinc the melo and the sitar
exhibit the completest similar not onli in habit but also in
their method of evolut there is no doubt whatev that i should
have succeed i even believ that thi method mai be attempt with
the cell of variou bee provid that the egg and the honei do not
differ too greatli from the anthophora i should not for exampl
count on be success with the cell of the threehorn osmia
who share the anthophora quarter her egg is short and thick and
her honei is yellow odourless solid almost a powder and veri
faintli flavour

the sitari ha penetr the anthophora cell it ha settl on

becom of it onc the egg is exhaust
let us to begin with go back to the larva of the sitari by the end
of a week the anthophora egg ha been drain dry by the parasit
and is reduc to the envelop a shallow skiff which preserv the
tini creatur from the deadli contact of the honei it is on thi
skiff that the first transform take place whereaft the larva
which is now organ to live in a glutin environ drop off
the raft into the pool of honei and leav it empti skin split along
the back cling to the pellicl of the egg at thi stage we see
float motionless on the honei a milkwhit atom oval flat and a

the digest canal which is gorg itself with honei and along the
circumfer of the flat ellipt back we perceiv a doubl row of
breathingpor which thank to their posit cannot be choke by
the viscou liquid befor describ the larva in detail we will wait
for it to attain it full develop which cannot take long for the
provis ar rapidli diminish
the rapid howev is not to be compar with that with which the
glutton larv of the anthophora consum their food thu on
visit the dwell of the anthophor for the last time on the
25th of june i found that the bee larv had all finish their
ration and attain their full develop wherea those of the
sitar still immers in the honei were for the most part onli
half the size which thei must final attain thi is yet anoth
reason why the sitar should destroi an egg which were it to
develop would produc a voraci larva capabl of starv them in
a veri short time when rear the larv myself in testtub i have
found that the sitar take thirtyf to forti dai to finish their
mess of honei and that the larv of the anthophora spend less than a
fortnight over the same meal
it is in the first half of juli that the sitarisgrub reach their
full dimens at thi period the cell usurp by the parasit
contain noth beyond a fullf larva and in a corner a heap of
reddish drop thi larva is soft and white about half an inch in
length and a quarter of an inch wide at it broadest part seen from
abov as it float on the honei it is ellipt in form taper
gradual toward the front and more suddenli toward the rear it
ventral surfac is highli convex it dorsal surfac on the contrari
is almost flat when the larva is float on the liquid honei it is

labrum and the complic lamina form by the lip and the jaw leav
between them a narrow slit in which the mandibl work
the leg ar mere vestig for though thei consist of three tini
cylindr joint thei ar bare a fiftieth of an inch in length
the creatur is unabl to make us of them not onli in the liquid
honei upon which it live but even on a solid surfac if we take the
larva from the cell and place it on a hard substanc to observ it
more readili we see that the inordin protuber of the abdomen
by lift the thorax from the ground prevent the leg from find
a support ly on it side the onli possibl posit becaus of
it conform the larva remain motionless or onli make a few
lazi wriggl movement of the abdomen without ever stir it
feebl limb which for that matter could not assist it in ani wai in
short the tini creatur of the first stage so activ and alert is
succeed by a ventripot grub depriv of movement by it veri
obes who would recogn in thi clumsi flabbi blind hideous
potbelli creatur with noth but a sort of stump for leg the
eleg pigmi of but a littl while back armourclad slender and
provid with highli perfect organ for perform it peril
journei
lastli we count nine pair of stigmata on pair on the mesothorax
and the rest on the first eight segment of the abdomen the last
pair that on the eighth abdomin segment consist of stigmata so
small that to detect them we have to gather their posit by that in
the succeed state of the larva and to pass a veri patient
magnifyingglass along the direct of the other pair these ar as
yet but vestigi stigmata the other ar fairli larg with pale
round flat edg
if in it first form the sitarislarva is organ for action to
obtain possess of the covet cell in it second form it is
organ sole to digest the provis acquir let us take a
glanc at it intern structur and in particular at it digest
apparatu here is a strang thing thi apparatu in which the hoard
of honei amass by the anthophora is to be engulf is similar in
everi respect to that of the adult sitari who possibl never take
food we find in both the same veri short oesophagu the same
chylif ventricl empti in the perfect insect distend in the
larva with an abund orangecolour pulp in both the same
gallbladd four in number connect with the rectum by on of
their extrem like the perfect insect the larva is devoid of
salivari gland or ani other similar apparatu it nervou system
compris eleven ganglia not count the oesophag collar wherea
in the perfect insect there ar onli seven three for the thorax of
which the last two ar contigu and four for the abdomen
when it ration ar finish the larva remain a few dai in a
motionless condit eject from time to time a few reddish
drop until the digest canal is complet clear of it
orangecolour pulp then the creatur contract itself huddl
itself togeth and befor long we see come detach from it bodi
a transpar slightli crumpl and extrem fine pellicl form
a close bag in which the success transform will take place
henceforth on thi epiderm bag thi sort of transpar leather
bottl form by the larva skin detach all of a piec without a
slit of ani kind we can distinguish the sever wellpreserv
extern organ the head with it antenn mandibl paw and
palpi the thorac segment with their vestig of leg the
abdomen with it chain of breathinghol still connect on to
anoth by tracheal thread
then beneath thi pellicl which is so delic that it can hardli
bear the most cautiou touch we see a soft white mass take shape
a mass which in a few hour acquir a firm horni consist and a
vivid yellow hue the transform is now complet let us tear the
fine gauz bag enclos the organ which ha just come into be
and direct our investig to thi third form of the sitarislarva
it is an inert segment bodi with an oval outlin a horni
consist just like that of pup and chrysalid and a
brightyellow colour which we can best describ by liken it to
that of a lemondrop it upper surfac form a doubl inclin plane
with a veri blunt ridg it lower surfac is at first flat but as
the result of evapor becom more concav daili leav a
project rim all around it oval outlin lastli it two
extrem or pole ar slightli flatten the major axi of the
lower surfac averag half an inch in length and the minor axi a
quarter of an inch
at the cephal pole of thi bodi is a sort of mask model roughli
on the head of the larva and at the opposit pole a small circular
disk deepli wrinkl at the centr the three segment that come after
the head bear each a pair of veri minut knob hardli visibl without
the len these ar to the leg of the larva in it previou form
what the cephal mask is to the head of the same larva thei ar not
organ but indic landmark place at the point where these
organ will appear later on either side we count nine stigmata set
as befor on the mesothorax and the first eight abdomin segment
the first eight breathinghol ar dark brown and stand out plainli
against the yellow colour of the bodi thei consist of small shini
conic knob perfor at the top with a round hole the ninth
stigma though fashion like the other is ever so much smaller it
cannot be distinguish without the len
the anomali alreadi so manifest in the chang from the first form to
the second becom even more so here and we do not know what name to
give to an organ without a standard of comparison not onli in the
order of beetl but in the whole class of insect while on the on
hand thi organ offer mani point of resembl to the pup of
the fli in it horni consist in the complet immobl of it
variou segment in the all but absolut absenc of relief which
would enabl on to distinguish the part of the perfect insect
while on the other hand it approxim to the chrysalid becaus
the creatur to attain thi condit ha to shed it skin as the
caterpillar do it differ from the pupa becaus it ha for cover
not the surfac skin which ha becom horni but rather on of the
inner skin of the larva and it differ from the chrysalid by the
absenc of mould which in the latter betrai the appendag of the
perfect insect lastli it differ yet more profoundli from the pupa
and the chrysali becaus from both these organ the perfect insect
spring straightwai wherea that which follow what we ar
consid is simpli a larva like that which went befor i shall
suggest to denot thi curiou organ the term pseudochrysali
and i shall reserv the name primari larva secondari larva and
tertiari larva to denot in a coupl of word each of the three
form under which the sitar possess all the characterist of
larv
although the sitari on assum the form of the pseudochrysali is
transfigur outwardli to the point of baffl the scienc of
entomolog phase thi is not so inwardli i have at everi season
of the year examin the viscera of the pseudochrysalid which
gener remain stationari for a whole year and i have never
observ other form among their organ than those which we find in
the secondari larva the nervou system ha undergon no chang the
digest apparatu is absolut void and becaus of it empti
appear onli as a thin cord sunk lost amid the adipos sac the
stercor intestin ha more substanc it outlin ar better
defin the four gallbladd ar alwai perfectli distinct the
adipos tissu is more abund than ever it form by itself the
whole content of the pseudochrysali for in the matter of volum the
insignific thread of the nervou system and the digest
apparatu count for noth it is the reserv upon which life must
draw for it futur labour
a few sitar remain hardli a month in the pseudochrysali stage the
other phase ar achiev in the cours of august and at the
begin of septemb the insect attain the perfect state but as a
rule the develop is slower the pseudochrysali goe through the
winter and it is not at the earliest until june in the second year
that the final transform take place let us pass in silenc over
thi long period of repos dure which the sitari in the form of a
pseudochrysali slumber at the bottom of it cell in a sleep as
letharg as that of a germ in it egg and come to the month of june
and juli in the follow year the period of what we might call a
second hatch
the pseudochrysali is still enclos in the delic pouch form of
the skin of the secondari larva outsid noth fresh ha happen
but import chang have taken place insid i have said that the
pseudochrysali displai an upper surfac arch like a hog back
and a lower surfac at first flat and then more and more concav the
side of the doubl inclin plane of the upper or dorsal surfac also
share in thi depress occas by the evapor of the fluid
constitu and a time come when these side ar so depress that
a section of the pseudochrysali through a plane perpendicular to it
axi would be repres by a curvilinear triangl with blunt
corner and inwardli convex side thi is the appear displai by
the pseudochrysali dure the winter and spring
but in june it ha lost thi wither appear it repres a
perfect balloon an ellipsoid of which the section perpendicular to
the major axi ar circl someth ha also come to pass of greater
import than thi expans which mai be compar with that which
we obtain by blow into a wrinkl bladder the horni integu of
the pseudochrysali have becom detach from their content all of a
piec without a break just as happen the year befor with the skin
of the secondari larva and thei thu form a fresh vesicular envelop
free from ani adhes to the content and itself enclos in the
pouch form of the secondari larva skin of these two bag without
outlet on of which is enclos within the other the outer is
transpar flexibl colourless and extrem delic the second
is brittl almost as delic as the first but much less transluc
becaus of it yellow colour which make it resembl a thin flake
of amber on thi second sac ar found the stigmat wart the
thorac stud and so forth which we note on the pseudochrysali
lastli within it caviti we catch a glimps of someth the shape of
which at onc recal to mind the secondari larva
and inde if we tear the doubl envelop which protect thi
mysteri we recogn not without astonish that we have befor
our ey a new larva similar to the secondari after on of the
strangest transform the creatur ha gone back to it second
form to describ the new larva is unnecessari for it differ from
the former in onli a few slight detail in both there is the same
head with it variou appendag bare outlin the same vestig
of leg the same stump transpar as crystal the tertiari larva
differ from the secondari onli by it abdomen which is less fat
ow to the absolut empti of the digest apparatu by a
doubl chain of fleshi cushion extend along each side by the rim
of the stigmata crystallin and slightli project but less so than
in the pseudochrysali by the ninth pair of breathinghol hitherto
rudimentari but now almost as larg as the rest lastli by the
mandibl end in a veri sharp point evict from it twofold
sheath the tertiari larva make onli veri lazi movement of
contract and dilat without be abl to advanc without even
be abl to maintain it normal posit becaus of the weak of
it leg it usual remain motionless ly on it side or els
displai it drowsi activ mere by feebl wormlik movement
by dint of these altern contract and dilat indol though
thei be the larva nevertheless contriv to turn right round in the
sort of shell with which the pseudochrysalid integu provid it
when by accid it find itself place head downward and thi
oper is all the more difficult inasmuch as the larva almost
exactli fill the caviti of the shell the creatur contract bend
it head under it belli and slide it front half over it hinder
half by wormlik movement so slow that the len can hardli detect
them in less than a quarter of an hour the larva at first turn
upsid down find itself again head uppermost i admir thi
gymnast feat but have some difficulti in understand it so small
is the space which the larva when at rest in it cell leav
unoccupi compar with that which we should be justifi in
expect from the possibl of such a revers the larva doe not
long enjoi the privileg which enabl it to resum insid it cell
when thi is move from it origin posit the attitud which it
prefer that is to sai with it head up
two dai at most after it first appear it relaps into an
inertia as complet as that of the pseudochrysali on remov it
from it amber shell we see that it faculti of contract or
dilat at will is so complet paralys that the stimulu of a
needl is unabl to provok it though the integu have retain
all their flexibl and though no percept chang ha occur in
the organ the irrit therefor which in the
pseudochrysali is suspend for a whole year reawaken for a moment
to relaps instantli into the deepest torpor thi torpor will be
partli dispel onli at the moment of the pass into the nymphal
stage to return immedi afterward and last until the insect
attain the perfect state
further on hold larv of the third form or nymph enclos in
their cell in an invert posit in glass tube we never see
them regain an erect posit howev long we continu the
experi the perfect insect itself dure the time that it is
enclos in the shell cannot regain it for lack of the requisit
flexibl thi total absenc of movement in the tertiari larva
when a few dai old and also in the nymph togeth with the
small of the space left free in the shell would necessarili lead
to the convict if we had not wit the first moment of the
tertiari larva that it is absolut imposs for the creatur to
turn right round
and now see to what curiou infer thi lack of observ made
at the due moment mai lead us we collect some pseudochrysalid and
heap them in a glass jar in all possibl posit the favour
season arriv and with veri legitim astonish we find that in
a larg number of shell the larva or nymph occupi an invert
posit that is to sai the head is turn toward the anal
extrem of the shell in vain we watch these revers bodi for ani
indic of movement in vain we place the shell in everi
imagin posit to see if the creatur will turn round in vain
onc more we ask ourselv where the free space is which thi turn
would demand the illus is complet i have been taken in by it
myself and for two year i indulg in the wildest conjectur to
account for thi lack of correspond between the shell and it
content to explain in short a fact which is inexplic onc the
propiti moment ha pass
on the natur site in the cell of the anthophora thi appar
anomali never occur becaus the secondari larva when on the point
of transform into the pseudochrysali is alwai care to place
it head uppermost accord as the axi of the cell more or less
nearli approach the vertic but when the pseudochrysalid ar
place higgledypiggledi in a box or jar all those which ar upsid
down will later contain invert larv or nymph
after four chang of form so profound as those which i have
describ on might reason expect to find some modif of
the intern organ nevertheless noth is chang the
nervou system is the same in the tertiari larva as in the earlier
phase the reproduct organ do not yet show and there is no need
to mention the digest apparatu which remain invari even in
the perfect insect
the durat of the tertiari larva is a bare four or five week which
is also about the durat of the second in juli when the secondari
larva pass into the pseudochrysalid stage the tertiari larva pass
into the nymphal stage still insid the doubl vesicular envelop
it skin split along the back in front and with the assist of a
few feebl contract which reappear at thi junctur it is thrust
behind in the shape of a littl ball there is therefor noth here
that differ from what happen in the other beetl
nor doe the nymph which succe thi tertiari larva present ani
peculiar it is the perfect insect in swaddlingband yellowish
white with it variou extern member clear as crystal displai
under the abdomen a few week elaps dure which the nymph partli
don the liveri of the adult state and in about a month the insect
moult for a last time in the usual manner in order to attain it
final form the wingcas ar now of a uniform yellowish white as
ar the wing the abdomen and the greater part of the leg veri
nearli all the rest of the bodi is of a glossi black in the space of
twentyfour hour the wingcas assum their halfblack halfrusset
colour the wing grow darker and the leg finish turn black
thi done the adult organ is complet howev the sitari
remain still a fortnight in the intact shell eject at interv
white drop of uric acid which it push back togeth with the
shred of it last two slough those of the tertiari larva and of the
nymph lastli about the middl of august it tear the doubl bag
that contain it pierc the lid of the anthophora cell enter a
corridor and appear outsid in quest of the other sex
i have told how while dig in search of the sitari i found two
cell belong to melo cicatricosu on contain an anthophora
egg with thi egg wa a yellow lous the primari larva of the melo
the histori of thi tini creatur we know the second cell also wa
full of honei on the sticki liquid float a littl white larva
about a sixth of an inch in length and veri differ from the other
littl white larv belong to sitar the rapid fluctuat of the
abdomen show that it wa eagerli drink the strongscent nectar
collect by the bee thi larva wa the young melo in the second
period of it develop
i wa not abl to preserv these two preciou cell which i had
open wide to examin the content on my return from carpentra i
found that their honei had been spilt by the motion of the carriag
and that their inhabit were dead on the 25th of june a fresh
visit to the nest of the anthophor furnish me with two larv like
the forego but much larger on of them wa on the point of
finish it store of honei the other still had nearli half left
the first wa put in a place of safeti with a thousand precaut
the second wa at onc immers in alcohol
these larv ar blind soft fleshi yellowish white cover with a
fine down visibl onli under the len curv into a fishhook like
the larv of the lamellicorn to which thei bear a certain
resembl in their gener configur the segment includ
the head number thirteen of which nine ar provid with
breathinghol with a pale oval rim these ar the mesothorax and
the first eight abdomin segment as in the sitarislarv the last
pair of stigmata that of the eighth segment of the abdomen is less
develop than the rest
the head is horni of a light brown colour the epistoma is edg with
brown the labrum is promin white and trapezoid the mandibl
ar black strong short obtus onli slightli curv sharpedg
and furnish each with a broad tooth on the inner side the maxillari
and labial palpi ar brown and shape like veri small stud with two
or three joint to them the antenn insert just at the base of the
mandibl ar brown and consist of three section the first is
thick and globular the two other ar much smaller in diamet and
cylindr the leg ar short but fairli strong abl to serv the
creatur for crawl or dig thei end in a strong black claw the
length of the larva when fulli develop is on inch
as far as i can judg from the dissect of the specimen preserv in
alcohol whose viscera were affect by be kept too long in that
liquid the nervou system consist of eleven ganglia not count
the oesophag collar and the digest apparatu doe not differ
percept from that of an adult oilbeetl
the larger of the two larv of the 25th of june place in a testtub
with what remain of it provis assum a new form dure the
first week of the follow month it skin split along the front
dorsal half and after be push half back left partli uncov a
pseudochrysali bear the closest analog with that of the sitar
newport did not see the larva of the oilbeetl in it second form
that which it displai when it is eat the mess of honei hoard by
the bee but he did see it moult skin halfcov the
pseudochrysali which i have just mention from the sturdi mandibl
and the leg arm with a power claw which he observ on thi
moult skin newport assum that instead of remain in the same
anthophoracel the larva which is capabl of burrow pass from
on cell to anoth in search of addit nourish thi
suspicion seem to me to be wellfound for the size which the larva
final attain exce the proport which the small quantiti of
honei enclos in a singl cell would lead us to expect
let us go back to the pseudochrysali it is as in the sitar an
inert bodi of a horni consist ambercolour and divid into
thirteen segment includ the head it length is 20
millimetres1 it is slightli curv into an arc highli convex on
the dorsal surfac almost flat on the ventral surfac and edg with
a project fillet which mark the divis between the two the head
is onli a sort of mask on which certain featur ar vagu carv in
still relief correspond with the futur part of the head on the
thorac segment ar three pair of tubercl correspond with the
leg of the recent larva and the futur insect lastli there ar nine
pair of stigmata on pair on the mesothorax and the eight follow
pair on the first eight segment of the abdomen the last pair is
rather smaller than the rest a peculiar which we have alreadi
note in the larva which preced the pseudochrysali
footnot 1 787 inchtransl note
on compar the pseudochrysalid of the oilbeetl and sitar we
observ a most strike similar between the two the same structur
occur in both down to the smallest detail we find on either side
the same cephal mask the same tubercl occupi the place of the
leg the same distribut and the same number of stigmata and
lastli the same colour the same rigid of the integu the
onli point of differ ar in the gener appear which is not
the same in the two pseudochrysalid and in the cover form by
the cast skin of the late larva in the sitar in fact thi cast
skin constitut a close bag a pouch complet envelop the
pseudochrysali in the oilbeetl on the contrari it is split down
the back and push to the rear and consequ onli halfcov
the pseudochrysali
the postmortem examin of the onli pseudochrysali in my
possess show me that similarli to that which happen in the
sitar no chang occur in the organ of the viscera
notwithstand the profound transform which take place
extern in the midst of innumer littl sac of adipos tissu
is buri a thin thread in which we easili recogn the essenti
featur of the digest apparatu both of the preced larval form
and of the perfect insect as for the medullari cord of the abdomen
it consist as in the larva of eight ganglia in the perfect insect
it compris onli four
i could not sai posit how long the oilbeetl remain in the
pseudochrysalid form but if we consid the veri complet analog
between the evolut of the oilbeetl and that of the sitar
there is reason to believ that a few pseudochrysalid complet their
transform in the same year while other in greater number
remain stationari for a whole year and do not attain the state of the
perfect insect until the follow spring thi is also the opinion
express by newport
be thi as it mai i found at the end of august on of these
pseudochrysalid which had alreadi attain the nymphal stage it is
with the help of thi preciou captur that i shall be abl to finish
the stori of the oilbeetl develop the horni integu of
the pseudochrysali ar split along a fissur which includ the whole
ventral surfac and the whole of the head and run up the back of the
thorax thi cast skin which is stiff and keep it shape is
halfenclos as wa the pseudochrysali in the skin shed by the
secondari larva lastli through the fissur which divid it almost
in two a meloenymph halfemerg so that to all appear the
pseudochrysali ha been follow immedi by the nymph which doe
not happen with the sitar which pass from the first of these two
state to the second onli by assum an intermediari form close
resembl that of the larva which eat the store of honei
but these appear ar decept for on remov the nymph from
the split sheath form by the integu of the pseudochrysali we
find at the bottom of thi sheath a third cast skin the last of
those which the creatur ha so far reject thi skin is even now
adher to the nymph by a few tracheal filament if we soften it in
water we easili recogn that it possess an organ almost
ident with that which preced the pseudochrysali in the latter
case onli the mandibl and the leg ar not so robust thu after
pass through the pseudochrysalid stage the oilbeetl for some
time resum the preced form almost without modif
the nymph come next it present no peculiar the onli nymph
that i have rear attain the perfect insect state at the end of
septemb under ordinari condit would the adult oilbeetl have
emerg from her cell at thi period i do not think so sinc the
pair and egglai do not take place until the begin of
spring she would no doubt have spent the autumn and the winter in the
anthophora dwell onli leav it in the spring follow it is
even probabl that as a rule the develop is even slower and that
the oilbeetl like the sitar for the most part spend the cold
season in the pseudochrysalid state a state welladapt to the
winter torpor and do not achiev their numer form until the
return of the warm weather
the sitar and melo belong to the same famili that of the
meloid2 their strang transform must probabl extend
throughout the group inde i had the good fortun to discov a
third exampl which i have not hitherto been abl to studi in all it
detail after twentyf year of investig on six occas no
often dure thi long period i have set ey on the
pseudochrysali which i am about to describ thrice i obtain it
from old chalicodomanest built upon a stone nest which i at first
attribut to the chalicodoma of the wall and which i now refer with
greater probabl to the chalicodoma of the shed i onc extract
it from the galleri bore by some woodeat larva in the trunk of
a dead wild peartre galleri afterward util for the cell of
an osmia i do not know which lastli i found a pair of them in
between the row of cocoon of the threeprong osmia o
tridentata duf who provid a home for her larv in a channel dug
in the dry brambl stem the insect in question therefor is a

possibl all of them ar in their earliest infanc parasit of the
harvest bee
the larva of the meloid befor reach the nymphal state pass
through four form which i call the primari larva the secondari
larva the pseudochrysali and the tertiari larva the passag
from on of these form to the next is effect by a simpl moult
without ani chang in the viscera
the primari larva is leatheri and settl on the bee bodi it
object is to get itself carri into a cell fill with honei on
reach the cell it devour the bee egg and it part is plai
the secondari larva is soft and differ complet from the primari
larva in it extern characterist it feed upon the honei
contain in the usurp cell
the pseudochrysali is a bodi depriv of all movement and clad in
horni integu which mai be compar with those of the pup and
chrysalid on these integu we see a cephal mask without
distinct or movabl part six tubercl indic the leg and nine
pair of breathinghol in the sitar the pseudochrysali is
enclos in a sort of seal pouch and in the zonit in a
tightfit bag form of the skin of the secondari larva in the
melo it is simpli halfsheath in the split skin of the secondari
larva
the tertiari larva reproduc almost exactli the peculiar of the
second it is enclos in the sitar and probabl also the zonit
in a doubl vesicular envelop form of the skin of the secondari
larva and the slough of the pseudochrysali in the melo it is
halfenclos in the split integu of the pseudochrysali even as
these in their turn ar halfenclos in the skin of the secondari
larva
from the tertiari larva onward the metamorphos follow their
habitu cours that is to sai thi larva becom a nymph and thi
nymph the perfect insect

cerocom mylabr and zonit
all ha not been told concern the meloid those strang parasit
some of which the sitar and the oilbeetl attach themselv
like the tiniest of lice to the fleec of variou bee to get
themselv carri into the cell where thei will destroi the egg and
afterward feed upon the ration of honei a most unexpect discoveri
made a few hundr yard from my door ha warn me onc again how
danger it is to gener to take it for grant as the mass of
data hitherto collect seem to justifi us in do that all the
meloid of our countri usurp the store of honei accumul by the
bee wa sure a most judici and natur gener mani
have accept it without hesit and i for my part wa on of
them for on what ar we to base our convict when we imagin that
we ar state a law we think to take our stand upon the gener and
we plung into the quicksand of error and behold the law of the
meloid ha to be struck off the statut a fate common to mani
other as thi chapter will prove
on the 16th of juli 1883 i wa dig with my son mile in the
sandi heap where a few dai earlier i had been observ the labour
and the surgeri of the mantiskil tachyt my purpos wa to
collect a few cocoon of thi diggerwasp the cocoon were turn up
in abund under my pockettrowel when mile present me with an
unknown object absorb in my task of collect i slip the find
into my box without examin it further than with a rapid glanc we
left the spot halfwai home the ardour of my search becam assuag
and a thought of the problemat object so neglig drop into
the box among the cocoon flash across my mind
hullo i said to myself suppos it were that why not but no
ye it is that that just what it is
then suddenli turn to mile who wa rather surpris by thi
soliloqui
my boi i said you have had a magnific find it a
pseudochrysali of the meloid it a document of incalcul valu
youv struck a fresh vein in the extraordinari record of these
creatur let us look at it close and at onc
the thing wa taken from the box dust by blow on it and
carefulli examin i realli had befor my ey the pseudochrysali of
some meloid it shape wa unfamiliar to me no matter i wa an old
hand and could not mistak it sourc everyth assur me that i
wa on the track of an insect that rival the sitar and the
oilbeetl in the strang of it transform and what wa a
still more preciou fact it occurr amid the burrow of the
mantiskil told me that it habit would be wholli differ
it veri hot my poor mile we ar both of us pretti done never
mind let go back to our sandhil and dig and have anoth search
i must have the larva that come befor the pseudochrysali i must
if possibl have the insect that come out of it
success respond ampli to our zeal we found a goodli number of
pseudochrysalid more often still we unearth larv which were busi
eat the mant the ration of the tachyt ar these realli the
larv that turn into the pseudochrysalid it seem veri probabl but
there is room for doubt rear them at home will dispel the mist of
probabl and replac them by the light of certainti but that is
all i have not a vestig of the perfect insect to inform me of the
natur of the parasit the futur let us hope will fill thi gap
such wa the result of the first trench open in the heap of sand
later search enrich my harvest a littl without furnish me
with fresh data
let us now proce to examin my doubl find and first of all the
pseudochrysali which put me on the alert it is a motionless rigid
bodi of a waxen yellow smooth shini curv like a fishhook
toward the head which is inflect under a veri power
magnifyingglass the surfac is seen to be strewn with veri tini
point which ar slightli rais and shinier than the surfac there
ar thirteen segment includ the head the dorsal surfac is
convex the ventral surfac flat a blunt ridg divid the two
surfac the three thorac segment bear each a pair of tini conic
nippl of a deep rusti red sign of the futur leg the stigmata
ar veri distinct appear as speck of a deeper red than the rest
of the integu there is on pair the largest on the second
segment of the thorax almost on the line divid it from the first
segment then follow eight pair on on each segment of the abdomen
except the last make in all nine pair of stigmata the last pair
that of the eighth abdomin segment is the smallest
the anal extrem displai no peculiar the cephal mask
compris eight coneshap tubercl dark red like the tubercl of
the leg six of these ar arrang in two later row the other
ar between the two row in each row of three nippl the on in the
middl is the largest it no doubt correspond with the mandibl the
length of thi organ vari greatli fluctuat between 8 and 15
millimetres1 it width is from 3 to 4 millimetres2
footnot 1 312 to 585 inchtransl note
footnot 2 117 to 156 inchtransl note
apart from the gener configur it will be seen that we have
here the strikingli characterist appear of the pseudochrysalid
of the sitar oilbeetl and zonit there ar the same rigid
integu of the red of a coughlozeng or virgin wax the same
cephal mask in which the futur mouthpart ar repres by
faintli mark tubercl the same thorac stud which ar the
vestig of the leg the same distribut of the stigmata i wa
therefor firmli convinc that the parasit of the mantishunt
could onli be a meloid
let us also record the descript of the strang larva found
devour the heap of mant in the burrow of the tachyt it is
nake blind white soft and sharpli curv it gener appear
suggest the larva of some weevil i should be even more accur if i
compar it with the secondari larva of melo cicatricosu of which
i onc publish a draw in the annal de scienc
naturelles3 if we reduc the dimens consider we shall
have someth veri like the parasit of the tachyt
footnot 3 it wa hi essai in thi period on the
metamorphos of the sitar and oilbeetl that procur fabr hi
first reput as an entomologisttransl note
the head is larg faintli ting with red the mandibl ar strong
bent into a point hook black at the tip and a fieri red at the
base the antenn ar veri short insert close to the root of the
mandibl i count three joint the first thick and globular the
other two cylindr the second of these cut short abruptli there
ar twelv segment apart from the head divid by fairli definit
groov the first thorac segment is a littl longer than the rest
with the dorsal plate veri slightli ting with russet as is the top
of the head begin with the tenth segment the bodi taper a
littl a slight scallop rim divid the dorsal from the ventral
surfac
the leg ar short white and transpar and end in a feebl claw a
pair of stigmata on the mesothorax near the line of junction with the
prothorax a stigma on either side of the first eight abdomin
segment in all nine pair of stigmata distribut like those of the
pseudochrysali these stigmata ar small ting with red and rather
difficult to distinguish vari in size like the pseudochrysalid
which seem to come from it thi larva averag nearli half an inch
in length and an eighth of an inch in width
the six littl leg feebl though thei be perform servic which on
would not at first suspect thei embrac the manti that is be
devour and hold her under the mandibl while the grub ly on
it side take it meal at it eas thei also serv for locomot
on a firm surfac such as the wooden top of my tabl the larva can
move about quit well it toddl along drag it belli with it
bodi straight from end to end on fine loos sand chang of posit
becom difficult the grub now bend itself into a bow it wriggl
upon it back upon it side it crawl a littl wai it dig and
heav with it mandibl but let a less crumbl support come to
it assist and pilgrimag of some length ar not beyond it
power
i rear my guest in a box divid into compart by mean of
paper partit each space repres about the capac of a
tachytescel receiv it layer of sand it pile of mant and it
larva and more than on disturb aros in thi refectori where i
had reckon upon keep the banquet isol on from the other
each at it special tabl thi larva which had finish it ration
the dai befor wa discov next dai in anoth chamber where it
wa share it neighbour repast it had therefor climb the
partit which for that matter wa of no great height or els had
forc it wai through some chink thi is enough i think to prove
that the grub is not a strict stayathom as ar the larv of the
sitar and the oilbeetl when devour the ration of the
anthophora
i imagin that in the burrow of the tachyt the grub when it
heap of mant is consum move from cell to cell until it ha
satisfi it appetit it subterranean excurs cannot cover a
wide rang but thei enabl it to visit a few adjac cell i have
mention how greatli the tachyt provis of mant varies4 the
smaller ration certainli fall to the male which ar puni dwarf
compar with their companion the more plenti fall to the
femal the parasit grub to which fate ha allot the scanti
masculin ration ha not perhap suffici with thi share it want
an extra portion which it can obtain by chang it cell if it be
favour by chanc it will eat accord to the measur of it hunger
and will attain the full develop of which it race allow if it
wander about without find anyth it will fast and will remain
small thi would explain the differ which i note in both the
grub and the pseudochrysalid differ amount in linear
dimens to a hundr per cent and more the ration rare or
abund accord to the cell lit upon would determin the size of
the parasit
footnot 4 the essai on the tachyt ha not yet appear in
english it will form part of a volum entitl more hunt
waspstransl note
dure the activ period the larva undergo a few moult i have
wit at least on of these the creatur strip of it skin
appear as it wa befor without ani chang of form it instantli
resum it meal which wa interrupt while the old skin wa shed
it embrac with it leg anoth manti on the heap and proce to
nibbl her whether simpl or multipl thi moult ha noth in
common with the renew due to the hypermetamorphosi which so
profoundli chang the creatur appear
ten dai rear in the partit box is enough to prove how right
i wa when i look upon the parasit larva feed on mant as the
origin of the pseudochrysali the object of my eager attent the
creatur which i kept suppli with addit food as long as it
accept it stop eat at last it becom motionless retract it
head slightli and bend itself into a hook then the skin split
across the head and down the thorax the tatter slough is thrust
back and the pseudochrysali appear in sight absolut nake it
is white at first as the larva wa but by degre and fairli rapidli
it turn to the russet hue of virgin wax with a brighter red at the
tip of the variou tubercl which indic the futur leg and
mouthpart thi shed of the skin which leav the bodi of the
pseudochrysali uncov recal the mode of transform observ
in the oilbeetl and is differ from that of the sitar and the
zonit whose pseudochrysali remain wholli envelop in the skin of
the secondari larva a sort of bag which is sometim loos sometim
tight and alwai unbroken
the mist that surround us at the outset is dispel thi is inde
a meloid a true meloid on of the strangest anomali among the
parasit of it tribe instead of live on the honei of a bee it
feed on the skewer of mant provid by a tachyt the
northamerican naturalist have taught us late that honei is not
alwai the diet of the blisterbeetl some meloid in the unit
state devour the packet of egg laid by the grasshopp thi is a
legitim acquisit on their part not an illeg seizur of the
foodstor of other no on as far as i am awar had as yet
suspect the true parasit of a carnivor meloid it is
nevertheless veri remark to find in the blisterbeetl on both
side of the atlant thi weak for the flavour of locust on
devour her egg the other a repres of the order in the
shape of the prai manti and her kin
who will explain to me thi predilect for the orthopteron in a
tribe whose chief the oilbeetl accept noth but the mess of
honei why do insect which appear close togeth in all our
classif possess such opposit tast if thei spring from a
common stock how did the consumpt of flesh supplant the
consumpt of honei how did the lamb becom a wolf thi is the
great problem which wa onc set us in an invers form by the
spot sapyga a honey rel of the flesheat scolia5
i submit the question to whom it mai concern
footnot 5 the essai on these will appear in the volum entitl
the hunt wasp aforementionedtransl note
the follow year at the begin of june some of my
pseudochrysalid split open transvers behind the head and
lengthwis down the whole of the median line of the back except the
last two or three segment from it emerg the tertiari larva which
from a simpl examin with the pocketlen appear to me in it
gener featur ident with the secondari larva the on which
eat the tachyt provis it is nake and paleyellow the colour
of butter it is activ and wriggl with awkward movement
ordinarili it li upon it side but it can also stand in the normal
posit the creatur is then try to us it leg without find
suffici purchas to enabl it to walk a few dai later it
relaps into complet repos
thirteen segment includ the head which is larg with a
quadrilater cranium round at the side short antenn consist
of three knot joint power curv mandibl with two or three
littl teeth at the end of a fairli bright red labial palpi rather
bulki short and with three joint like the antenn the mouthpart
labrum mandibl and palpi ar movabl and stir slightli as though
seek food a small brown speck near the base of each antenna
mark the place of the futur ey prothorax wider than the
segment that come after it these ar all of on width and ar
distinctli divid by a furrow and a slight later rim leg short
transpar without a termin claw thei ar threejoint stump
pale stigmata eight pair of them place as in the pseudochrysali
that is the first and largest pair on the line divid the first two
segment of the thorax and the seven other on the first seven
abdomin segment the secondari larva and the pseudochrysali also
have a veri small stigma on the penultim segment of the abdomen
thi stigma ha disappear in the tertiari larva at least i cannot
detect it with the aid of a good magnifyingglass
lastli we find the same strong mandibl as in the secondari larva
the same feebl leg the same appear of a weevilgrub the
movement return but ar less clearli mark than in the primari
form the passag through the pseudochrysalid state ha led to no
chang that is realli worth describ the creatur after thi
singular phase is what it wa befor the melo and sitar for
that matter behav similarli
then what can be the mean of thi pseudochrysalid stage which
when pass lead precis to the point of departur the meloid
seem to be revolv in a circl it undo what it ha just done it
draw back after advanc the idea sometim occur to me to look
upon the pseudochrysali as a sort of egg of a superior organ
start from which the insect follow the ordinari law of
entomolog phase and pass through the success stage of
larva nymph and perfect insect the first hatch that of the
normal egg make the meloid go through the larval dimorph of the
anthrax and the leucospi the primari larva find it wai to the
victual the secondari larva consum them the second hatch that
of the pseudochrysali revert to the usual cours so that the
insect pass through the three customari form larva nymph adult
the tertiari larval stage is of brief durat last about a
fortnight the larva then shed it skin by a longitudin rent along
the back as did the secondari larva uncov the nymph in which
we recogn the beetl the genu and speci be almost
determin by the antenn
the second year develop turn out badli the few nymph which i
obtain about the middl of june shrivel up without attain the
perfect form some pseudochrysalid remain on my hand without
show ani sign of approach transform i attribut thi
delai to lack of warmth i wa in fact keep them in the shade on a
whatnot in my studi wherea under natur condit thei ar
expos to the hottest sun beneath a layer of sand a few inch deep
to imit these condit without buri my charg whose progress
i wish to follow comfort i place the pseudochrysalid that
remain on a layer of fresh sand at the bottom of a glass receiv
direct exposur to the sun wa impractic it would have been fatal
at a period when life is subterranean to avoid it i ti over the
mouth of the receiv a few thick of black cloth to repres
the natur screen of sand and the apparatu thu prepar wa
expos for some week to the most brilliant sunshin in my window
under the cloth cover which ow to it colour favour the
absorpt of heat the temperatur dure the daytim becam that
of an oven and yet the pseudochrysalid persist in remain
stationari the end of juli wa near and noth indic a speedi
hatch convinc that my attempt at heat would be fruitless i
replac the pseudochrysalid in the shade on the shelv in glass
tube here thei pass a second year still in the same condit
june return onc more and with it the appear of the tertiari
larva follow by the nymph for the second time thi stage of
develop wa not exceed the on and onli nymph that i succeed
in obtain shrivel like those of the year befor will these two
failur aris no doubt from the overdri atmospher of my
receiv conceal from us the genu and the speci of the
mantis meloid fortun no the riddl is easili solv by
deduct and comparison
the onli melodi in my part of the countri which though their habit
ar still unknown might correspond in size with either the larva or
the pseudochrysali in question ar the twelvepoint mylabri and
schaeffer cerocoma i find the first in juli on the flower of the
sea scabiou i find the second at the end of mai and in june on the
head of the le dhyre everlast thi last date is bestsuit
to explain the presenc of the parasit larva and it pseudochrysali
in the tachyt burrow from juli onward moreov the cerocoma is
veri abund in the neighbourhood of the sandheap haunt by the
tachyt while the mylabri doe not occur there nor is thi all
the few nymph obtain have curiou antenn end in a full
irregular tuft the like of which is found onli in the antenn of the
male cerocoma the mylabri therefor must be elimin the
antenn in the nymph must be regularli joint as thei ar in the
perfect insect there remain the cerocoma
ani linger doubt mai be dispel by good fortun a friend of
mine dr beauregard who is prepar a masterli work upon the
blisterbeetl had some pseudochrysalid of schreber cerocoma in
hi possess have visit srignan for the purpos of scientif
investig he had search the tachyt sandheap in my compani
and taken back to pari a few pseudochrysalid of grub fed on mant
in order to follow their develop hi attempt like mine had
miscarri but on compar the srignan pseudochrysalid with those
of schreber cerocoma which came from aramon near avignon he wa
abl to establish the closest resembl between the two organ
everyth therefor confirm the supposit that my discoveri can
relat onli to schaeffer cerocoma as for the other it must be
elimin it extrem rariti in my neighbourhood is a suffici
reason
it is tiresom that the diet of the aramon meloid is not known if i
allow myself to be guid by analog i should be inclin to regard
schreber cerocoma as a parasit of tachyt tarsina who buri
her hoard of young locust in the high sandi bank in that case the
two cerocom would have a similar diet but i leav it to dr
beauregard to elucid thi import characterist
the riddl is deciph the meloid that eat prai mant is
schaeffer cerocoma of whom i find plenti in the spring on the
blossom of the everlast whenev i see it my attent is
attract by an unusu peculiar the great differ of size that
is abl to exist between on specimen and anoth albeit of the same
sex i see stunt creatur femal as well as male which ar
bare on third the length of their betterdevelop companion the
twelvespot mylabri and the fourspot mylabri present
differ quit as pronounc in thi respect
the caus which make a dwarf or a giant of the same insect
irrespect of it sex can be onli the smaller or greater quantiti
of food if the larva as i suspect is oblig to find the tachyt
gamelard for itself and to visit a second and a third when the
first is too frugal furnish it mai be imagin that the hazard of
the road doe not favour all in the same wai but rather allot
abund to on and penuri to anoth the grub that doe not eat it
fill remain small while the on that glut itself grow fat these
differ of size in themselv betrai parasit if a mother
pain had amass the food or if the famili had had the industri to
obtain it direct instead of rob other the ration would be
practic equal for all and the inequ in size would be
reduc to those which often occur between the two sex
thei speak moreov of a precari riski parasit wherein the
meloid is not sure of find it food which the sitari find so
deftli get itself carri by the anthophora after be born at
the veri entranc to the bee galleri and leav it retreat onli
to slip into it host fleec a vagabond oblig to find for itself
the food that suit it the cerocoma incur the risk of lenten fare
on chapter is lack to complet the histori of schaeffer
cerocoma that which treat of the begin the lai of the egg
the egg itself and the primari larva while watch the develop
of the mantis parasit i took my precaut in the first
year to discov it startingpoint by elimin what wa known to
me and seek among the meloid of my neighbourhood for the size that
correspond with the pseudochrysalid unearth from the tachyt
burrow i found as i have said onli schaeffer cerocoma and the
twelvespot mylabri i undertook to rear these in order to obtain
their egg
as a standard of comparison the fourspot mylabri of a more
impos size wa ad to the first two a fourth zoniti mutica
whom i did not need to consult know that she wa not connect
with the matter in hand and be familiar with her pseudochrysali
complet my school of egglay i propos if possibl to obtain
her primari larva lastli i had formerli rear some cantharid with
the object of observ their egglai in all five speci of

be briefer the pair with the creatur place end to end last
nearli an hour
the mylabr also must be veri expediti in their preliminari so
much so that my cage which were kept wellstock for two summer
provid me with numer batch of egg without give me a singl
opportun of catch the male in the least bit of a flirtat
let us therefor consid the egglai
thi take place in august for our two speci of mylabr in the
veget mould which doe duti as a floor to the wiregauz dome the
mother dig a pit fourfifth of an inch deep and as wide as her bodi
thi is the place for the egg the lai last bare half an hour
i have seen it last thirtysix hour with sitar thi quick of
the mylabri point to an incompar less numer famili the
hidingplac is next close the mother sweep up the rubbish with her
foreleg collect it with the rake of her mandibl and push it
back into the pit into which she now descend to stamp upon the
powderi layer and cram it down with her hindleg which i see swiftli
work when thi layer is well pack she start rake togeth
fresh materi to complet the fill of the hole which is carefulli
trampl stratum by stratum
i take the mother from her pit while she is engag in fill it up
delic with the tip of a camelhair pencil i move her a coupl
of inch the beetl doe not return to her batch of egg doe not
even look for it she climb up the wire gauz and proce to graze
among her companion on the bindwe or scabiou without troubl
herself further about her egg whose hidingplac is onli
halffil a second mother whom i move onli on inch is no longer
abl to return to her task or rather doe not think of do so i
take a third after shift her just as slightli and while the
forget creatur is climb up the trelliswork bring her back to
the pit i replac her with her head at the open the mother stand
motionless look thoroughli perplex she swai her head pass
her front tarsi through her mandibl then move awai and climb to
the top of the dome without attempt anyth in each of these
three case i have to finish fill in the pit myself what then ar
thi matern which the touch of a brush caus to forget it
duti and thi memori which is lost at a distanc of an inch from
the spot compar with these shortcom of the adult the expert
machin of the primari larva which know where it victual ar
and as it first action introduc itself into the dwell of the
host that is to feed it how can time and experi be factor of
instinct the newborn animalcul amaz us with it foresight the
adult insect astonish us with it stupid
with both mylabr the batch consist of some forti egg a veri
small number compar with those of the oilbeetl and the sitari
thi limit famili wa alreadi foreseen judg by the short space
of time which the egglay spend in her underground lodg the
egg of the twelvespot mylabri ar white cylindr round at

the first thorac segment ha veri nearli the same diamet as the

squar off in front in a straight line and is round at the side
and at the back it colour is bright red the second ring is hardli a
third as long as the first it is also red but a littl browner the
third is dark brown with a touch of green to it thi tint is
repeat throughout the abdomen so that in the matter of colour
the creatur is divid into two section the front which is a
fairli bright red includ the head and the first two thorac
segment the second which is a greenish brown includ the third
thorac segment and the nine abdomin ring
the three pair of leg ar pale red strong and long consid the
creatur small thei end in a singl long sharp claw
the abdomen ha nine segment all of an oliv brown the membran
space which connect them ar white so that from the second thorac

let us continu our examin of the relic of the burnt zoniti

at the bottom of thi pseudochrysalid sheath i find a littl white
wad which when place in water soften and then patient
unravel with the tip of a paintbrush yield a white powderi
substanc which is uric acid the usual product of the work of the
nymphosi and a rumpl membran in which i recogn the cast skin

layer repres the tertiari larva whose skin is left adher to
the envelop of the pseudochrysali it is fairli thick and tough but
i cannot detach it except in shred so close doe it adher to the

sinc i possess a fair number of pseudochrysalid i sacrif a

never succeed in extract a larva in it tertiari form though

remain enclos insid on anoth but with an interv between so
that the tertiari larva can move and turn as it wish in it multipl
enclosur in the zonit there is the same arrang with thi
differ that until the nymph appear there is no empti space
between on slough and the next the tertiari larva cannot budg it
is not free as wit it cast skin which fit so precis to the

unperceiv if it exist were not proclaim by the membran which

cerdo whose larval habit it wa as well to studi in order to learn
whether the instinct ar modifi when the form and the organ
remain ident ha thi pigmi of the famili the same talent as the
giant the ravag of the oaktre doe it work on the same
principl the resembl between the two both in the larval state
and in that of the perfect insect is complet the denizen of the
cherrytre is an exact replica on a smaller scale of the denizen of
the oak if instinct is the inevit consequ of the organ we
ought to find in the two insect a strict similar of habit if
instinct is on the other hand a special aptitud favour by the
organ we must expect variat in the industri exercis for the
second time the altern is forc upon our attent do the
implement govern the practic of the craft or doe the craft govern
the employ of the implement is instinct deriv from the organ
or is the organ instinct servant an old dead cherrytre will
answer our question
beneath it rag bark which i lift in wide strip swarm a
popul of larv all belong to cerambyx cerdo there ar big
larv and littl larv moreov thei ar accompani by nymph
these detail tell us of three year of larval exist a durat
of life frequent in the longicorn seri if we hunt the thick of the
trunk split it again and again it doe not show us a singl grub
anywher the entir popul is encamp between the bark and the
wood here we find an inextric maze of wind galleri cram
with pack sawdust cross recross shrink into littl
allei expand into wide space and cut on the on hand into
the surfac layer of the sapwood and on the other into the thin
sheet of the inner bark the posit speak for itself the larva of
the littl capricorn ha other tast than it larg kinsman for
three year it gnaw the outsid of the trunk beneath the thin
cover of the bark while the other seek a deeper refug and gnaw
the insid
the dissimilar is yet more mark in the prepar for the
nymphosi then the worm of the cherrytre leav the surfac and
penetr into the wood to a depth of about two inch leav
behind it a wide passag which is hidden on the outsid by a remnant

the grub li down and goe to sleep for the nymphosi with it head

the two capricorn have in short the same system of close their

the similar of habit go no farther despit the ident of
structur there is even a veri sharp contrast between the method
pursu the capricorn of the oak inhabit the deep layer of the

to the bark the second descend from the bark to the wood the first
risk the peril of the outer world the second shun them and seek a

the second know noth of thi luxuri though the work is almost the

the tool therefor doe not govern the trade thi is what the two

doe not have to work upward on the contrari it work downward
more remark still the egg doe not lie immedi on top of the

egg ha to make a breach in a wall befor take nourish
of what us ar these obstacl i do not doubt that thei have their
purpos if the grub is born at the bottom of a close pot if it ha
to chew through brick to reach the larder i feel sure that certain

difficult to interrog howev it is possibl to catch a glimps
of on or two point
the grompha burrow is shallow those littl cylind her loav
ar greatli expos to drought over there as here the dry up of

well the receptacl is dug in veri fine homogen watertight
earth with not a bit of gravel not an atom of sand in it togeth

the clai foodpit with it closelyfit lid is an excel

the rude task would be avoid if the egg lai directli on top of the

shell of a dry fruit with a stone ly free insid it doe it
contain the grub shrivel by desicc doe it contain the dead
insect i thought so but i wa wrong it contain someth much more
instruct than that
i carefulli rip up the gourd with the point of a knife within a
homogen wall whose thick is over threequart of an inch in
the largest of my three specimen is encas a spheric kernel
which fill the caviti exactli but without stick to the wall at
ani part the small amount of free plai allow to thi kernel
account for the rattl which i heard when i shook the thing
in the colour and gener appear of the whole the kernel doe not
differ from the wrapper but break it open and minut examin the
piec we now recogn tini fragment of bone flock of down
thread of wool scrap of flesh the whole mix in an earthi past
resembl chocol
thi past when place on hot charcoal sift under the len and
depriv of it particl of dead bodi becom much darker is
cover with shini bubbl and send forth puff of that acrid smoke
by which we so readili recogn burnt anim matter the whole mass

treat in the same manner the wrapper also turn black but not to
the same extent it hardli smoke it doe not becom cover with
jetblack bubbl lastli it would not anywher contain bit of
carcas similar to those in the central kernel in both case the
residu after calcin is a fine reddish clai
thi brief analysi tell us all about the tabl of phanu milon
the fare serv to the grub is a sort of meatpi the sausagemeat
consist of a minc of all that the two scalpel of the forehead and
the tooth knive of the foreleg have been abl to remov from the
corps hair and down small crush bone strip of flesh and skin
now hard as brick the thicken of thi mincemeat wa origin a
past of fine clai steep in the liquor of corrupt lastli the
light crust of our meatpi is here repres by a cover of the
same clai less rich in extract of meat than the other
the pastrycook give hi work an eleg shape he decor it with
rosett with twist with scroll phanu milon is no stranger to
these culinari sthetic she turn the crust of her meatpi into a
splendid gourd with a fingerprint ornament
the outer cover an unprofit crust insuffici steep in
savouri juic is not we can easili guess intend for consumpt
it is possibl that somewhat later when the stomach becom robust
and is not repel by coars fare the grub scrape a littl from the
side of it pasti wall but until the adult insect emerg the
calabash as a whole remain intact have act at first as a
safeguard of the fresh of the forcemeat and all the while as a
protect casket for the reclus
abov the cold pastri right at the base of the neck of the gourd is
contriv a round cell with a clai wall continu the gener wall a
fairli thick floor made of the same materi separ it from the
storeroom thi is the hatchingchamb here is laid the egg which
i find in it place but dri up here is hatch the grub which to
reach the ball of food must first open a trapdoor through the
partit that separ the two stori
we have here in short the edific of the grompha in a differ
style of architectur the grub is born in a casket surmount the
stack of food but not commun with it the bud larva must
therefor at the opportun moment itself pierc the cover of the
pot of preserv as a matter of fact later when the grub is on the
sausagemeat we find the floor perfor with a hole just larg
enough for it to pass through
wrap all round in a thick case of potteri the meat keep fresh
as long as is requir by the durat of the hatchingprocess a
detail which i have not ascertain in it cell which is also of
clai the egg li safe capit so far all is well phanu milon
is thoroughli acquaint with the secret of fortif and the
danger of victual evapor too soon there remain the germ
respiratori requir
to satisfi these the insect ha been equal wellinspir the neck

outsid at the tip of the nippl it spread into a wide mouth thi

narrow and by grain of dust which obstruct it a littl without
stop it up i said it wa simpli marvel wa i wrong if a

blind chanc is gift with extraordinari power of foresight
how doe the clumsi insect manag to accomplish so delic and
complex a piec of build explor the pampa as i do through the
ey of an intermediari my onli guid in thi question is the
structur of the work a structur whenc we can deduct the workman
method without go far astrai i therefor imagin the build to
proce in thi manner a small carcas is found the ooz of which
ha soften the underli loam the insect collect more or less of
thi loam accord to the rich of the vein there ar no precis
limit here if the plastic materi be plenti the collector is
lavish with it and the provisionbox becom all the more solid then
enorm calabash ar obtain exceed a hen egg in volum and
form of an outer wall threequart of an inch thick but a mass of
thi descript is beyond the strength of the model is badli
handl and betrai in it shape the awkward attend on an
overdifficult task if the materi be rare the insect confin it
harvest to what is strictli necessari and then freer in it
movement it obtain a magnific regular gourd
the loam is probabl first knead into a ball and then scoop out
into a larg and veri thick cup by the pressur of the foreleg and

schism if the true dungwork ha actual turn himself into an

dungwork at no time have materi for the work been lack in
either case
noth not the scarciti of provis nor the climat nor the
revers season would explain thi strang diverg we must
perforc regard it as a matter of origin special of tast not

under the transpar skin of the larva which ha been recent
hatch and is consum it first cricket we soon perceiv some fine
white spot which rapidli increas in size and number and eventu
cover the whole bodi except the first two or three segment on
dissect the grub we find that these spot have to do with the
adipos layer of which thei form a consider part for far from

thick and ar present in such number that the forcep cannot
seiz the least fragment of thi tissu without pick up a few of
them
though perfectli visibl without the help of a len these puzzl
spot call for the microscop if we wish to studi them in detail we
then find that the adipos tissu is made up of two kind of vesicl
some bright yellow and transpar ar fill with oili drop the
rest opaqu and starchwhit ar distend with a veri fine powder
which spread in a cloudi trail when the vesicl contain it is
broken on the objectslid intermingl without appar order the
two kind of bag ar of the same shape and the same size the first
go to make up the nutrit reserv the fatti tissu properli
socal the second form the white dot which we will studi for a

an inspect under the microscop tell us that the content of the
white cell ar compos of veri fine opaqu grain insolubl in
water and of greater densiti the us of chemic reagent on the

effervesc and without leav the least residu even when thei
ar still enclos in their vesicl on the other hand the true
fatti cell suffer in no wai when attack by thi acid thei mere
turn a littl yellow
let us take advantag of thi properti to oper on a larger scale
the adipos tissu taken from a number of larv is treat with nitric
acid the effervesc is as live as if the reaction were take
effect on a bit of chalk when it ha subsid some yellow clot ar
float on the surfac these ar easili separ thei come from

have observ them in mani other insect either in the larval or in
the perfect state but in thi respect there is none to equal the grub
of the gamehunt wasp which is all speckl with white i think i
see the reason
let us consid two larv which eat live prei that of the sphex and
that of the hydrophilus5 uric acid the inevit product of the
vital transform or at all event on of it analogu must be
form in both but the hydrophilu larva show no accumul of it

with thi object i pave the centr of the space beneath the cover
flush with the soil with a brick which i sprinkl with a thin layer
of sand thi will be the soil that cannot be dug all around it for
some distanc and on the same level li the loos soil which is
easi to delv
in order to approach the condit of the anecdot i must have a
mous with a mole a heavi mass the remov would perhap present
too much difficulti to obtain on i place my friend and neighbour

the mous so greatli desir is mine i place her upon the centr of
the brick the gravedigg under the wire cover ar now seven in
number includ three femal all have gone to earth some ar
inact close to the surfac the rest ar busi in their crypt the
presenc of the fresh corps is soon perceiv about seven oclock in
the morn three necrophori come hurri up two male and a
femal thei slip under the mous who move in jerk a sign of the
effort of the buryingparti an attempt is made to dig into the layer
of sand which hide the brick so that a bank of rubbish accumul
round the bodi
for a coupl of hour the jerk continu without result i profit by
the circumst to learn the manner in which the work is perform
the bare brick allow me to see what the excav soil would conceal
from me when it is necessari to move the bodi the beetl turn over
with hi six claw he grip the hair of the dead anim prop himself
upon hi back and push us hi forehead and the tip of hi
abdomen as a lever when he want to dig he resum the normal
posit so turn and turn about the sexton strive now with hi
leg in the air when it is a question of shift the bodi or
drag it lower down now with hi feet on the ground when it is
necessari to enlarg the grave
the point at which the mous li is final recogn as
unassail a male appear in the open he explor the corps goe
round it scratch a littl at random he goe back and immedi
the dead bodi rock is he advis hi collabor of what he ha
discov is he arrang the work with a view to their establish
themselv elsewher on propiti soil
the fact ar far from confirm thi idea when he shake the bodi
the other imit him and push but without combin their effort
in a given direct for after advanc a littl toward the edg
of the brick the burden goe back again return to the point of
departur in the absenc of a concert understand their effort
of leverag ar wast nearli three hour ar occupi by
oscil which mutual annul on anoth the mous doe not
cross the littl sandhil heap about her by the rake of the
worker
for the second time a male appear and make a round of explor
a bore is effect in loos earth close besid the brick thi is a
trial excav to learn the natur of the soil a narrow well of
no great depth into which the insect plung to half it length the
wellsink return to the other worker who arch their back and
the load progress a fingersbreadth toward the point recogn as
favour have we done the trick thi time no for after a while
the mous recoil there is no progress toward a solut of the
difficulti
now two male come out in search of inform each of hi own
accord instead of stop at the point alreadi sound a point most
judici chosen it seem on account of it proxim which
would save labori cart thei precipit scour the whole area
of the cage try the soil on thi side and on that and plough
superfici furrow in it thei get as far from the brick as the
limit of the enclosur permit
thei dig by prefer against the base of the cover here thei make
sever bore without ani reason so far as i can see the bed of
soil be everywher equal assail awai from the brick the
first point sound is abandon for a second which is reject in
it turn a third and fourth ar tri then anoth at the sixth
point the choic is made in all these case the excav is by no
mean a grave destin to receiv the mous but a mere trial bore
of inconsider depth and of the diamet of the digger bodi
back again to the mous who suddenli shake swing advanc
recoil first in on direct then in anoth until in the end the
hillock of sand is cross now we ar free of the brick and on
excel soil littl by littl the load advanc thi is no cartag
by a team haul in the open but a jerki remov the work of
invis lever the bodi seem to shift of it own accord
thi time after all those hesit the effort ar concert at
least the load reach the region sound far more rapidli than i
expect then begin the burial accord to the usual method it is
on oclock it ha taken the necrophori halfwai round the clock to
ascertain the condit of the local and to displac the mous
in thi experi it appear in the first place that the male plai
a major part in the affair of the household betterequip
perhap than their mate thei make investig when a difficulti
occur thei inspect the soil recogn whenc the check aris and
choos the spot at which the grave shall be dug in the lengthi
experi of the brick the two male alon explor the surround
and set to work to solv the difficulti trust her assist the
femal motionless beneath the mous await the result of their
enquiri the test which ar to follow will confirm the merit of
these valiant auxiliari
in the second place the point where the mous li be recogn
as present an insurmount resist there is no grave dug in
advanc a littl farther off in the loos soil all the attempt ar
limit i repeat to shallow sound which inform the insect of
the possibl of inhum
it is absolut nonsens to speak of their first prepar the grave to
which the bodi will afterward be cart in order to excav the
soil our sexton have to feel the weight of their dead upon their
back thei work onli when stimul by the contact of it fur
never never in thi world do thei ventur to dig a grave unless the
bodi to be buri alreadi occupi the site of the caviti thi is
absolut confirm by my two month and more of daili observ
the rest of clairvil anecdot bear examin no better we ar
told that the necrophoru in difficulti goe in search of assist
and return with companion who assist him to buri the mous thi in
anoth form is the edifi stori of the sacr beetl whose pellet
ha roll into a rut powerless to withdraw hi booti from the abyss
the wili dungbeetl summon three or four of hi neighbour who

the illinterpret exploit of the thiev pillrol set me on my

ask what precaut the observ took to recogn the owner of the

wa bound not to neglect were thei not rather five chanc necrophori
who guid by the smell without ani previou understand hasten
to the abandon mous to exploit her on their own account i inclin
to thi opinion the likeliest of all in the absenc of exact

probabl becom certainti if we check the fact by experi the

it is a child stori worthi to rank with ani fairytal for the
amus of the simpl
a hard soil necessit the remov of the bodi is not the onli
difficulti with which the necrophori ar acquaint frequent
perhap more often than not the ground is cover with grass abov
all with couchgrass whose tenaci rootlet form an inextric
network below the surfac to dig in the interstic is possibl but
to drag the dead anim through them is anoth matter the mesh of
the net ar too close to give it passag will the gravedigg find
himself helpless against such an obstacl which must be an extrem
common on that could not be
expos to thi or that habitu impedi in the exercis of it
call the anim is alwai equip accordingli otherwis it
profess would be impractic no end is attain without the
necessari mean and aptitud besid that of the excav the
necrophoru certainli possess anoth art the art of break the
cabl the root the stolon the slender rhizom which check the
bodi descent into the grave to the work of the shovel and the pick
must be ad that of the shear all thi is perfectli logic and
mai be clearli foreseen nevertheless let us call in experi the
best of wit
i borrow from the kitchenrang an iron trivet whose leg will suppli
a solid foundat for the engin which i am devis thi is a
coars network made of strip of raffia a fairli accur imit
of that of the couchgrass the veri irregular mesh ar nowher wide
enough to admit of the passag of the creatur to be buri which
thi time is a mole the machin is plant by it three feet in the
soil of the cage level with the surfac a littl sand conceal the
rope the mole is place in the centr and my band of sexton ar
let loos upon the bodi
the burial is perform without a hitch in the cours of an afternoon
the raffia hammock almost the equival of the natur network of
the couchgrass scarc disturb the buryingprocess matter do not
proce quit so quickli and that is all no attempt is made to shift
the mole who sink into the ground where he li when the oper
is finish i remov the trivet the network is broken at the spot
where the corps wa ly a few strip have been gnaw through a
small number onli as mani as were strictli necessari to permit the
passag of the bodi
well done my undertak i expect no less of your skill and tact
you foil the experiment wile by emploi the resourc which
you us against natur obstacl with mandibl for shear you
patient cut my string as you would have gnaw the thread of the
grassroot thi is meritori if not deserv of except
glorif the shallowest of the insect that work in earth would
have done as much if subject to similar condit
let us ascend a stage in the seri of difficulti the mole is now
fix by a strap of raffia fore and aft to a light horizont
crossbar rest on two firmlypl fork it is like a joint of
venison on the spit eccentr fasten the dead anim touch
the ground throughout the length of it bodi
the necrophori disappear under the corps and feel the contact of
it fur begin to dig the grave grow deeper and an empti space
appear but the covet object doe not descend retain as it is by
the crossbar which the two fork keep in place the dig slacken
the hesit becom prolong
howev on of the gravedigg climb to the surfac wander over
the mole inspect him and end by perceiv the strap at the back
he gnaw and ravel it tenaci i hear the click of the shear
that complet the ruptur crack the thing is done drag down by
hi own weight the mole sink into the grave but slantwis with hi
head still outsid kept in place by the second strap
the beetl proce with the burial of the hinder part of the mole
thei twitch and jerk it now in thi direct now in that noth
come of it the thing refus to give a fresh sorti is made by on
of them to find out what is happen overhead the second strap is
perceiv is sever in turn and henceforth the work goe on as well
as could be wish
my compliment perspicaci cablecutt but i must not
exagger the mole strap were for you the littl cord with which
you ar so familiar in turfi soil you broke them as well as the
hammock of the previou experi just as you sever with the blade
of your shear ani natur thread stretch across your catacomb it
is an indispens trick of your trade if you had had to learn it by
experi to think it out befor practis it your race would have
disappear kill by the hesit of it apprenticeship for the
spot prolif of mole frog lizard and other viand to your tast
ar usual cover with grass
you ar capabl of much better thing still but befor set forth
these let us examin the case when the ground bristl with slender
brushwood which hold the corps at a short distanc from the ground
will the find thu hang where it chanc to fall remain unemploi
will the necrophori pass on indiffer to the superb morsel which
thei see and smell a few inch abov their head or will thei make
it drop from it gibbet
game doe not abound to such a point that it can be despis if a few
effort will obtain it befor i see the thing happen i am persuad
that it will fall that the necrophori often confront with the
difficulti of a bodi not ly on the soil must possess the
instinct to shake it to the ground the fortuit support of a few
bit of stubbl of a few interlac twig so common in the field
cannot put them off the drop of the suspend bodi if place too
high must certainli form part of their instinct method for the
rest let us watch them at work
i plant in the sand of the cage a meagr tuft of thyme the shrub is
at most some four inch in height in the branch i place a mous
entangl the tail the paw and the neck among the twig to increas
the difficulti the popul of the cage now consist of fourteen
necrophori and will remain the same until the close of my
investig of cours thei do not all take part simultan in
the dai work the major remain underground doze or occupi in
set their cellar in order sometim onli on often two three
or four rare more busi themselv with the corps which i offer
them todai two hasten to the mous who is soon perceiv overhead
on the tuft of thyme
thei gain the top of the plant by wai of the trelliswork of the cage
here ar repeat with increas hesit due to the inconveni
natur of the support the tactic emploi to remov the bodi when
the soil is unfavour the insect prop itself against a branch
thrust altern with back and claw jerk and shake
vigor until the point whereat it is work is freed from it
fetter in on brief shift by dint of heav their back the two
collabor extric the bodi from the tangl yet anoth shake
and the mous is down the burial follow
there is noth new in thi experi the find ha been treat
just as though it lai on soil unsuit for burial the fall is the
result of an attempt to transport the load
the time ha come to set up the frog gibbet made famou by
gleditsch the batrachian is not indispens a mole will serv as
well or even better with a ligament of raffia i fix him by hi
hindleg to a twig which i plant vertic in the ground insert
it to no great depth the creatur hang plumb against the gibbet it
head and shoulder make ampl contact with the soil
the gravedigg set to work beneath the part which li along the
ground at the veri foot of the stake thei dig a funnel into which
the mole muzzl head and neck sink littl by littl the gibbet
becom uproot as thei descend and end by fall drag over by
the weight of it heavi burden i am assist at the spectacl of the
overturn stake on of the most astonish feat of reason with
which the insect ha ever been credit
thi for on who is consid the problem of instinct is an
excit moment but let us bewar of form conclus just yet we
might be in too great a hurri let us first ask ourselv whether the
fall of the stake wa intent or accident did the necrophori
lai it bare with the express purpos of make it fall or did thei
on the contrari dig at it base sole in order to buri that part of
the mole which lai on the ground that is the question which for the
rest is veri easi to answer
the experi is repeat but thi time the gibbet is slant and
the mole hang in a vertic posit touch the ground at a
coupl of inch from the base of the apparatu under these
condit absolut no attempt is made to overthrow it not the
least scrape of a claw is deliv at the foot of the gibbet the
entir work of excav is perform at a distanc under the bodi
whose shoulder ar ly on the ground here and here onli a hole is
dug to receiv the front of the bodi the part access to the
sexton
a differ of an inch in the posit of the suspend anim
destroi the famou legend even so mani a time the most elementari
siev handl with a littl logic is enough to winnow a confus
mass of statement and to releas the good grain of truth
yet anoth shake of thi siev the gibbet is slant or
perpendicular no matter which but the mole fix by hi hindleg
to the top of the twig doe not touch the soil he hang a few
fingersbreadth from the ground out of the sexton reach
what will thei do now will thei scrape at the foot of the gibbet in
order to overturn it by no mean and the ingenu observ who
look for such tactic would be greatli disappoint no attent is
paid to the base of the support it is not vouchsaf even a stroke of
the rake noth is done to overturn it noth absolut noth
it is by other method that the buryingbeetl obtain the mole
these decis experi repeat under mani differ form prove
that never never in thi world do the necrophori dig or even give a
superfici scrape at the foot of the gallow unless the hang
bodi touch the ground at that point and in the latter case if the
twig should happen to fall thi is in no wai an intent result
but a mere fortuit effect of the burial alreadi commenc
what then did the man with the frog of whom gleditsch tell us
realli see if hi stick wa overturn the bodi place to dry beyond
the assault of the necrophori must certainli have touch the soil a
strang precaut against robber and damp we mai well attribut
more foresight to the prepar of dri frog and allow him to hang
hi anim a few inch off the ground in that case as all my
experi emphat declar the fall of the stake undermin by
the sexton is a pure matter of imagin
yet anoth of the fine argument in favour of the reasoningpow of
insect fli from the light of investig and founder in the
slough of error i wonder at your simpl faith o master who take
serious the statement of chancemet observ richer in
imagin than in verac i wonder at your credul zeal when
without critic you build up your theori on such absurd
let us continu the stake is henceforth plant perpendicularli but
the bodi hang on it doe not reach the base a condit enough to
ensur that there will never be ani dig at thi point i make us
of a mous who by reason of her light weight will lend herself
better to the insect manoeuvr the dead anim is fix by the
hindleg to the top of the apparatu with a raffia strap it hang
plumb touch the stick
soon two necrophori have discov the morsel thei climb the greas
pole thei explor the prize poke their forehead into it fur it
is recogn as an excel find to work therefor here we have
again but under more difficult condit the tactic emploi when
it wa necessari to displac the unfavour situat bodi the two
collabor slip between the mous and the stake and take a grip
of the twig and exert a leverag with their back thei jerk and
shake the corps which swai twirl about swing awai from the
stake and swing back again all the morn is pass in vain
attempt interrupt by explor on the anim bodi
in the afternoon the caus of the check is at last recogn not
veri clearli for the two obstin gallowrobb first attack the
mous hindleg a littl wai below the strap thei strip them bare
flai them and cut awai the flesh about the foot thei have reach the
bone when on of them find the string of raffia beneath hi
mandibl thi to him is a familiar thing repres the
grassthread so frequent in burial in turfi soil tenaci the
shear gnaw at the bond the fibrou fetter is broken and the mous
fall to be buri soon after
if it stood alon thi break of the suspend tie would be a
magnific perform but consid in connect with the sum of
the beetl customari labour it lose ani farreach signific
befor attack the strap which wa not conceal in ani wai the
insect exert itself for a whole morn in shake the bodi it
usual method in the end find the cord it broke it as it would
have broken a thread of couchgrass encount underground
under the condit devis for the beetl the us of the shear is
the indispens complement of the us of the shovel and the modicum
of discern at hi dispos is enough to inform him when it will be
well to emploi the clipper he cut what embarrass him with no
more exercis of reason than he displai when lower hi dead mous
underground so littl doe he grasp the relat of caus and effect
that he tri to break the bone of the leg befor bite the raffia
which is knot close besid him the difficult task is attempt
befor the extrem easi on
difficult ye but not imposs provid that the mous be young
i begin over again with a strip of iron wire on which the insect
shear cannot get a grip and a tender mousekin half the size of an
adult thi time a tibia is gnaw through saw in two by the
beetl mandibl near the spring of the heel the detach leg
leav plenti of space for the other which readili slip from the
metal band and the littl corps fall to the ground
but if the bone be too hard if the prize suspend be a mole an
adult mous or a sparrow the wire ligament oppos an insurmount
obstacl to the attempt of the necrophori who for nearli a week
work at the hang bodi partli strip it of fur or feather and
dishevel it until it form a lament object and at last
abandon it when desicc set in and yet a last resourc remain
on as ration as infal to overthrow the stake of cours not
on dream of do so
for the last time let us chang our artific the top of the gibbet
consist of a littl fork with the prong wide open and measur
bare twofifth of an inch in length with a thread of hemp less
easili attack than a strip of raffia i bind the hindleg of an
adult mous togeth a littl abov the heel and i slip on of the
prong in between to bring the thing down on ha onli to slide it a
littl wai upward it is like a young rabbit hang in the window of
a poulter shop
five necrophori come to inspect what i have prepar after much
futil shake the tibi ar attack thi it seem is the method
usual emploi when the corps is caught by on of it limb in some
narrow fork of a lowgrow plant while try to saw through the
bonea heavi job thi timeon of the worker slip between the
shackl leg in thi posit he feel the furri touch of the mous
against hi chine no more is need to arous hi propens to
thrust with hi back with a few heav of the lever the thing is
done the mous rise a littl slide over the support peg and
fall to the ground
is thi manoeuvr realli thought out ha the insect inde perceiv
by the light of a flash of reason that to make the morsel fall it wa
necessari to unhook it by slide it along the peg ha it actual
perceiv the mechan of the hang i know some personsinde i
know manywho in the presenc of thi magnific result would be
satisfi without further investig
more difficult to convinc i modifi the experi befor draw a
conclus i suspect that the necrophoru without in ani wai
forese the consequ of hi action heav hi back mere
becaus he felt the anim leg abov him with the system of
suspens adopt the push of the back emploi in all case of
difficulti wa brought to bear first upon the point of support and
the fall result from thi happi coincid that point which ha
to be slip along the peg in order to unhook the object ought
realli to be place at a short distanc from the mous so that the
necrophori mai no longer feel her directli on their back when thei
push
a wire bind togeth now the claw of a sparrow now the heel of a
mous and is bent threequart of an inch farther awai into a
littl ring which slip veri loos over on of the prong of the
fork a short almost horizont prong the least push of thi ring is
enough to bring the hang bodi to the ground and becaus it stand
out it lend itself excel to the insect method in short the
arrang is the same as just now with thi differ that the
point of support is at a short distanc from the anim hung up
my trick simpl though it be is quit success for a long time
the bodi is repeatedli shaken but in vain the tibi the hard claw
refus to yield to the patient saw sparrow and mice grow dry and
shrivel unus upon the gallow my necrophori some sooner some
later abandon the insolubl mechan problem to push ever so
littl the movabl support and so to unhook the covet carcas
curiou reason in faith if just now thei had a lucid idea of
the mutual relat between the ti leg and the suspend peg if
thei made the mous fall by a reason manoeuvr whenc come it that
the present artific no less simpl than the first is to them an
insurmount obstacl for dai and dai thei work on the bodi
examin it from head to foot without notic the movabl support
the caus of their mishap in vain i prolong my watch i never see a
singl on of them push the support with hi foot or butt it with hi
head
their defeat is not due to lack of strength like the geotrup thei
ar vigor excav when you grasp them firmli in your hand thei
slip into the interstic of the finger and plough up your skin so as
to make you quickli loos your hold with hi head a power
ploughshar the beetl might veri easili push the ring off it short
support he is not abl to do so becaus he doe not think of it he
doe not think of it becaus he is devoid of the faculti attribut
to him in order to support their theori by the danger
generos of the evolutionist
divin reason sun of the intellect what a clumsi slap in thy august
counten when the glorifi of the anim degrad thee with such
dens
let us now examin the mental obscur of the necrophori under
anoth aspect my captiv ar not so satisfi with their sumptuou
lodg that thei do not seek to escap especi when there is a
dearth of labour that sovran consol of the afflict man or beast
intern within the wire cover pall upon them so when the mole is
buri and everyth in order in the cellar thei strai uneasili over
the trellis dome thei clamber up come down go up again and take
to flight a flight which instantli becom a fall ow to collis
with the wire grate thei pick themselv up and begin all over
again the sky is splendid the weather is hot calm and propiti
for those in search of the lizard crush besid the footpath perhap
the effluvia of the gami titbit have reach them from afar
impercept to ani other sens than that of the gravedigg my
necrophori therefor would be glad to get awai
can thei noth would be easier if a glimmer of reason were to aid
them through the trelliswork over which thei have so often strai
thei have seen outsid the free soil the promis land which thei
want to reach a hundr time if onc have thei dug at the foot of
the rampart there in vertic well thei take up their station
drows whole dai on end while unemploi if i give them a fresh
mole thei emerg from their retreat by the entrancecorridor and come
to hide themselv beneath the belli of the beast the burial over
thei return on here on there to the confin of the enclosur and
disappear underground
well in two and a half month of captiv despit long stai at the
base of the trelli at a depth of threequart of an inch beneath
the surfac it is rare inde for a necrophoru to succe in
circumv the obstacl in prolong hi excav beneath the
barrier in dig an elbow and bring it out on the other side a
trifl task for these vigor creatur of fourteen onli on
succe in escap
a chanc deliver and not premedit for if the happi event had
been the result of a mental combin the other prison
practic hi equal in power of percept would all from first
to last have discov by ration mean the elbow path lead to
the outer world and the cage would promptli be desert the failur
of the great major prove that the singl fugit wa simpli
dig at random circumst favour him and that is all we
must not put it to hi credit that he succeed where all the other
fail
we must also bewar of attribut to the necrophori a duller
understand than is usual in insect psycholog i find the inept

the bed of sand into which the rim of the dome sink a littl wai

you have surpris thi or that insect motionless on a bough
blissfulli bask in the sun your hand is rais open readi to

insect drop to the ground it is a wearer of armour wingcas
slow to disengag the wing from their horni sheath or perhap an

the surpris insect let itself fall you look for it in the grass
often in vain if you do find it it is ly on it back with it

it is sham dead peopl will tell you it is pretend in order

sham dead the bear came up turn the man over and over explor
him with hi paw and hi muzzl snif at hi face

the bird would not be dupe by thi clumsi stratagem in those happi

more insist doubt occur to my mind when i consid the seriou

dead sai the popular idiom which reck littl of weigh the valu
of it term it simul death scientif languag repeat happi to
find some gleam of reason in the insect what truth is there in thi

logic argument ar insuffici here it is essenti that we
should obtain the verdict of experi which alon can furnish a
valid repli but to which of the insect shall we go first
i rememb someth that date back some forti year delight with

i follow them a hunter on the trail of a new speci at the end of

remain a long time without stir no other insect ha yet
displai such persist immobl though i confess that my

is so thoroughli engrav on my memori that forti year later when i

their track which i follow long ago on the actual spot bore

spread out and arm with hook gather the dust and rubbish into a
load which is thrust backward in thi wai a mound rise on the
threshold of the burrow the dwell grow deeper quickli and by a
gentl slope reach the bottom of the jar
check in the downward direct the scarit now dig against the
glass wall and continu hi work horizont until he ha obtain a
length of nearli twelv inch in all
thi arrang of the galleri almost the whole of which run just
under the glass is veri us to me enabl me to follow the
insect in the privaci of it home if i wish to observ it
underground oper all that i need do is to remov the opaqu
sheath which i have been care to put over the jar in order to
spare the creatur the annoy of the light
when the hous is deem to be long enough the scarit return to
the entranc which he work more carefulli than the rest he make a
funnel of it a pit with shift slope side it is the antlion
crater on a larger scale and construct in a more rustic fashion
thi mouth is continu by an inclin plane kept free of all
rubbish at the foot of the slope is the vestibul of the horizont
galleri here as a rule the hunter lurk motionless with hi
pincer half open he is wait
there is a sound overhead it is a specimen of game which i have just
introduc a cicada a lusciou morsel the drowsi trapper at onc
wake he move hi palpi which quiver with cupid cautious
step by step he climb hi inclin plane he take a glanc outsid
the funnel the cicada is seen
the scarit dart out of hi pit run forward seiz the cicada and
drag her backward the struggl is brief thank to the trap of the
entranc which yawn like a funnel to receiv even a bulki quarri and
contract into a crumbl precipic that paralys all resist
the slope is fatal who cross the brink can no longer escap the
murder
head first the cicada dive into the abyss down which the spoiler
drag her by success jerk she is drawn into the lowceiling
tunnel here the wing ceas to flutter for lack of space she
reach the knacker cellar at the end of the corridor the scarit
now work at her for some time with hi pincer in order to reduc
her to complet immobl fear lest she should escap then he
return to the mouth of the charnelhous
it is not everyth to possess plenti of game the question next
aris how to consum it in peac the door is therefor close
against importun caller that is to sai the insect fill the
entranc to the tunnel with hi mound of rubbish have taken thi
precaut he goe back again and sit down to hi meal he will not
reopen hi hidingplac nor remak the pit at the entranc until
later when the cicada ha been digest and hunger make it
reappear let us leav the glutton with hi quarri
the brief morn which i spent with him in hi nativ place did not
enabl me to watch him at hi hunt on the sand of the beach but
the fact gather in captiv ar enough to tell us all about it
thei show us in the scarit a bold hero who is not to be intimid
by the biggest or strongest adversari
we have seen him come up from underground fall on the
passersbi seiz them at some distanc from the burrow and drag
them forcibl into hi cutthroat den the rosechaf the common
cockchaf ar but small deer for him he dare to attack the cicada
he dare to dig hi hook into the corpul pinechaf he is a
fearless ruffian readi for ani crime
under natur condit hi audac can be no less on the contrari
the familiar spot freedom of movement unlimit space and hi
belov salt air excit the warrior to yet greater feat of dare
he ha dug himself a refug in the sand with a wide crumbl mouth
thi is not so that he mai like the antlion wait at the bottom of
hi funnel for the pass of a victim which stumbl on the shift
slope and roll into the pit the scarit disdain these petti
poacher method these fowler snare he prefer a run across

hi long trail on the sand tell us of nocturn round in search of
big game often the pimelia sometim the halfspot scarab5 the

the simul of death
the first insect that we will put to the question is that audaci
disembowel the savag scarit to provok hi state of inertia is
a veri simpl matter i handl him for a moment roll him between
my finger better still i drop him on the tabl twice or thrice in
success from a small height when the shock due to the fall ha
been administ and if need be repeat i turn the insect on it
back
thi is enough the prostrat beetl no longer stir li as though
dead the leg ar fold on the belli the antenn extend like the
arm of a cross the pincer open a watch besid me tell me the
exact minut of the begin and the end of the experi noth
remain but to wait and especi to arm on self with patienc

insect privat impress these ar impenetr mysteri let us
confin ourselv to record the result
immobl continu fairli often for as long as fifti minut in
certain case even it last more than an hour the most frequent
length of time averag twenti minut if noth disturb the
beetl if i cover him with a glass shade protect him from the
fli who ar importun visitor in the hot weather prevail at
the time of my experi the inertia is complet not a quiver of
the tarsi nor of the palpi nor of the antenn here inde is a
simulacrum of death with all it inertia
at last the appar deceas come back to life the tarsi quiver
those of the foreleg first the palpi and the antenn move slowli to

for 17 20 25 33 and 50 minut start with a quarter of an hour
the attitud of death end by last nearli a whole hour
without be constant similar fact recur repeatedli in my
experi the durat of cours vari thei tell us that as a
gener rule the scarit lengthen the period of hi lifeless postur
the often the experi is repeat is thi a matter of practic
or is it an increas of cun emploi in the hope of final tire
a too persist enemi it would be prematur to draw conclus the
crossexamin of the insect ha not yet been thorough enough
let us wait besid we need not imagin that it is possibl to go on
like thi until our patienc is exhaust sooner or later flurri
by my pester the scarit refus to sham dead scarc is he
laid on hi back after a fall when he turn over and take to hi
heel as though he judg a stratagem which succeed so
indiffer to be henceforth useless
if we were to stop here it would certainli seem that the insect a
cun hoaxer seek as a mean of defenc to cheat those who
attack him he counterfeit death he repeat the process becom
more persist in hi fraud in proport as the aggress is
repeat he abandon hi trickeri when he deem it futil but
hitherto we have subject him onli to a friendli
examinationinchief the time ha come to put a string of search
question and to trick the trickster if there be realli ani decept
the beetl under experi is ly on the tabl he feel beneath
him a hard bodi which give him no chanc of dig as he cannot
hope to take refug underground an easi task for hi nimbl and
vigor tool the scarit li low in hi deathlik pose keep
it up if need be for an hour if he were reclin on the sand the
loos soil with which he is so familiar would he not regain hi

hi desir to escap into the basement
i wa expect to see him do so and i wa mistaken whether i place
him on wood glass sand or garden mould the beetl in no wai
modifi hi tactic on a surfac readili excav he continu hi
immobl as long as on an unassail surfac
thi indiffer to the natur of the support half open the door to
doubt what follow open it wide the patient is on the tabl befor
me and i watch him close with hi gleam ey overshadow by
hi antenn he also see me he watch me he observ me if i mai
so express myself what can be the visual impress of the insect
when face to face with that monstros man how doe the pigmi
measur the enorm monument that is the human bodi seen from the
depth of the infinit littl the immens perhap is noth
we will not go so far as that we will admit that the insect watch
me recogn me as hi persecutor so long as i am here he will
suspect me and refus to budg if he doe decid to do so it will be
after he ha exhaust my patienc let us therefor move awai then
sinc ani trickeri will be needless he will hasten to take to hi
leg again and make off
i move ten pace farther from him to the other end of the room i
hide i do not move a muscl for fear of break the silenc will
the insect pick itself up no my precaut ar superflu alon
left to itself perfectli quiet it remain motionless for as long a
time as when i wa stand close besid it
perhap the clearsight scarit ha seen me in my corner at the
other end of the room perhap a subtl scent ha reveal my presenc
to him we will do more then i cover him with a bellglass which
will save him from be worri by the fli and i leav the room i
go downstair into the garden there is no longer anyth like to
disturb him door and window ar close not a sound from without
no caus for alarm indoor what will happen in the midst of that
profound silenc
noth more and noth less than usual after twenti forti minut
wait out of door i come upstair again and return to my insect i
find him as i left him ly motionless on hi back
thi experi mani time repeat with differ subject throw a
vivid light upon the question it expressli assur us that the
attitud of death is not the ruse of an insect in danger here there
is noth to alarm the creatur around him all is silenc solitud
repos when he persist in hi immobl it cannot now be to deceiv
an enemi i have no doubt about it there is someth els involv
besid why should he need special defens artific i could
understand that a weak pacif illprotect insect might resort to
ruse when in danger but in him the warlik bandit so well
armour it is more than i can understand no insect on hi nativ
seashor ha the strength to resist him the most power of them
the sacr beetl and the pimelia ar easygo creatur which so
far from molest him ar fine booti for hi burrow
can he be threaten by the bird it is veri doubt as a carabu
he is satur with acrid humour which must make hi bodi a far from
pleas mouth for the rest he live hidden from the light of dai
in a burrow where no on see him he emerg onli at night when the
bird ar no longer inspect the beach there ar no beak about for
him to fear
and thi butcher of the pime and even occasion of the sacr
beetl thi bulli whom no danger threaten is suppos to be such a
coward as to sham death on the slightest alarm i take the liberti of
doubt thi more and more
i am confirm in my doubt by the smoothskin scarit s
lavigatu fab a denizen of the same shore the first insect is a
giant the second by comparison is a dwarf otherwis he displai
the same shape the same jetblack costum the same armour the same
habit of brigandag well the smoothskin scarit in spite of
hi weak and hi small is almost ignor of the trick of
pretend to be dead when molest for a moment and then turn on
hi back he at onc pick himself up and flee i can hardli obtain a
few second immobl onc onli daunt by my obstinaci the dwarf
remain motionless for a quarter of an hour
how differ from the giant motionless the moment that he is thrown
upon hi back sometim pick himself up onli after an hour of
inact it is the revers of what ought to happen if the appar
death were realli a defens ruse the giant confid in hi
strength should disdain thi cowardli postur the timid dwarf should
be quick to have recours to it and it is just the other wai about
what is there behind all thi
let us try the influenc of danger with what natur enemi shall i
confront the big scarit motionless on hi back i know none let us
then creat a makebeliev assail the fli put me on the track of
on
i have spoken of their importun dure my investig in the hot
season if i do not emploi a bellglass or keep an assidu watch
rare doe the shrewish dipteron fail to alight upon my patient and
explor him with her probosci we will let her have her wai thi
time
hardli ha the fly graze thi appar corps with her leg when the
scarit tarsi quiver as though twitch by a slight electr shock
if the visitor be mere pass matter go no farther but if she
persist particularli near the beetl mouth moist with saliva and
disgorg secret of food the torment scarit promptli kick
turn over and make off
perhap he did not think it opportun to prolong hi fraud in the face
of so contempt an enemi he resum hi activ becaus he ha
recogn the absenc of danger then let us call in anoth
interlop on of formid size and strength i happen to have
handi a great capricorn with power claw and mandibl that the
longhorn insect is a peac creatur i am well awar but the
scarit doe not know it on the sand of the shore he ha never
encount such a colossu as thi who is capabl of impress less
timid creatur than he fear of the unknown will mere aggrav the
situat
guid by the tip of my straw the capricorn set hi foot upon the
prostrat insect the scarit tarsi begin to quiver immedi if
the contact be prolong or multipli or if it becom aggress
the dead insect get on it leg again and scuttl off just as the
titil of the fly have alreadi shown me when danger is immin
and all the more to be dread becaus it natur is unknown the
trick of the simul of death disappear and flight take it
place
the follow experi is not without valu i take some hard
substanc and knock the foot of the tabl on which the insect is ly
on it back the shock is veri slight not enough to shake the tabl
percept the whole thing is limit to the inner vibrat of a
resili bodi which ha receiv a blow but it is quit enough to
disturb the insect immobl at each tap the tarsi ar flex and
quiver for a moment
lastli let us try the effect of light so far the patient ha been
treat in the shade of my cabinet awai from the direct sunlight the
sun is shine full upon the window what will the motionless insect
do if i carri it thither from my tabl to the window into the bright
light that we can find out in a moment under the direct rai of the
sun the scarit immedi turn over and move off
thi is enough patient persecut creatur you have halfbetrai
your insect when the fly tickl you drain your moist lip treat
you as a corps whose juic she would like to suck when the huge
capricorn appear to your horrifi gaze and put a foot on your
belli as though to take possess of hi prei when the tabl
quiver that is to sai when for you the ground shake undermin
perhap by some invad of your burrow when a bright light surround
you favour the design of your enemi and imperil your safeti
as an insect that love the dark then in truth it would be wiser
not to move if realli your chief resourc when danger threaten you
is to simul death
on the contrari at those critic moment you give a start you
move you resum your normal attitud you run awai your fraud is
discov or to put it more plainli there is no trick your
inertia is not simul it is real it is a condit of temporari
torpor into which you ar plung by your delic nervou
organ a mere noth make you fall into it a mere noth
withdraw you from it abov all a bath of light that sovran stimulu
of activ
in respect of prolong immobl as the result of emot i find a
rival of the giant scarit in a larg black bupresti with a
flourspeckl corselet a lover of the blackthorn the hawthorn and
the apricottre hi name is capnodi tenebrioni lin at time i
see him with hi leg close fold and hi antenn lower
prolong hi motionless postur upon hi back for more than an hour
at other time the insect is bent upon escap appar influenc
by atmospher condit of which i do not know the secret on or
two minut immobl is as much as i can then obtain
let me recapitul in my variou subject the attitud of death is
of veri variabl durat govern as it is by a host of unsuspect
circumst let us take advantag of favour opportun
which ar fairli frequent i subject the cloudi bupresti to the
differ test undergon by the giant scarit the result ar the
same when you have seen the first you have seen the second there is
no need to linger over them
i will onli mention the prompt with which the bupresti ly
motionless in the shade recov hi activ when i carri him awai
from my tabl into the broad sunlight of the window after a few
second of thi bath of heat and light the insect halfopen hi
wingcas us them as lever and turn over readi to take flight
if my hand did not instantli snap him up he is a passion lover of
the light a devote of the sun intox himself in it rai upon
the bark of hi blackthorntre on the hottest afternoon
thi love of tropic temperatur suggest the follow question
what would happen if i were to chill the creatur in it immobil
postur i forese a more prolong inertia the chill of cours
must not be great for it would be follow by the lethargi into which
insect capabl of surviv the winter fall when benumb by the
cold
on the contrari the bupresti must as far as possibl retain hi full
vital the lower of the temperatur must be gentl veri
moder and such that the insect under similar climat condit
would retain hi power of action in ordinari life i have a
conveni refriger at my dispos it is the water of my well
whose temperatur in summer is nearli twentytwo degre fahrenheit
below that of the surround air
the bupresti in whom i have just produc inertia by mean of a few
tap is instal on hi back in a littl flask which i seal
hermet and immers in a bucket full of thi cold water to keep
the bath as cool as at first i gradual renew it take care not to
shake the flask in which the patient is ly in hi attitud of
death
the result reward my pain after five hour under water the insect
is still motionless five hour i sai five long hour and i might
certainli sai longer if my exhaust patienc had not put an end to
the experi but thi is enough to banish ani idea of fraud on the
insect part here beyond a doubt the insect is not sham dead
he is actual somnol depriv of the power of movement by an
intern disturb which my teas produc at the outset and which
is prolong beyond it usual limit by the surround cool
i try the effect of a slight decreas in temperatur upon the giant
scarit by subject him to a similar sojourn in the cold water of
the well the result doe not respond to the hope which the bupresti
gave me i do not succe in obtain more than fifti minut
inertia i have often obtain as long period of immobl without
resort to the refriger artific
it might have been foreseen the bupresti a lover of the burn
sunshin is affect by the cold bath in a differ degre from the
scarit who prowl about by night and spend hi dai in the
basement a fall of a few degre in temperatur take the chilli
insect by surpris and ha no effect upon the on accustom to the
cool underground
other experi on these line tell me noth more i see the inert
condit persist sometim for a longer sometim for a shorter
period accord as the insect seek the sunlight or avoid it let
us chang our method
i evapor a few drop of sulphur ether in a glass jar and put in a
stercorac geotrup and a specimen of bupresti tenebrioni at
the same time in a few moment both subject ar motionless
ansthet by the ether vapour i take them out quickli and lai
them on their back in the open air
their attitud is exactli that which thei would have assum under the
influenc of a shock or ani other caus of alarm the bupresti ha
hi leg symmetr fold against hi chest and belli the
geotrup ha hi outspread stretch in disord rigid and as
though attack by catalepsi you could not tell if thei were dead or
aliv
thei ar not dead in a minut or two the geotrup tarsi twitch
the palpi quiver the antenn wave gentli to and fro then the
foreleg move and a quarter of an hour ha not elaps befor the
other leg ar struggl the activ of the insect made motionless
by the concuss of a shock would reawaken in precis the same
fashion
as for the bupresti he is in a state of inertia so profound that at
first i realli believ him to be dead he recov dure the night
and next dai i find him in possess of hi usual activ the ether
experi which i took care to stop at the moment when it produc
the desir effect ha not been fatal to him but it ha had much
more seriou consequ for him than for the geotrup the insect
more sensit to the alarm due to concuss or to a fall of
temperatur is also the more sensit to the action of ether
thu the enorm differ which i observ in these two insect
with regard to the inertia provok by a shock or by handl them in
on finger is explain by nice differ of impression
wherea the bupresti remain motionless for nearli an hour the
geotrup is struggl violent after a minut or two and even then
i rare attain thi limit
in what respect ha the geotrup to defend itself less need of the
stratagem of simul death than the black bupresti well protect
by hi massiv build and hi armour which is so hard that it resist
the point of a pin and even of a needl we should be perplex by the
same question in respect of a multitud of insect some of which
remain motionless while other do not and we could not possibl
forese what would happen from the genu of the subject it form or
it wai of live
bupresti tenebrioni for exampl exhibit a persist inertia
will it be the same becaus of similar of structur with other
member of the same group not at all my chanc find provid me with
the brilliant bupresti b rutilan fab and the ninespot
bupresti ptosima novemmaculata fab the first resist all my
attempt the splendid creatur grip my finger grip my tweezer
and insist on get up the moment that i lai it on it back the
second readili becom immobil but how brief is it attitud of
death four or five minut at most
a melasomabeetl omocr abbreviatu oliv whom i frequent
discov under the broken stone on the neighbour hill continu
motionless for over an hour he rival the scarit we must not
forget to add that veri often the awaken take place within a few
minut
can he ow hi long period of inertia to the fact that he is on of
the tenebrionid or darkl beetl by no mean for here in the
same group is pimelia bipunctata who turn a somersault on hi
round back and find hi feet the moment he ha turn over here is a
cellarbeetl blap simili latr who unabl to turn with hi

thi appar wellfound forecast i have consult the genera

thi on will readili assum the postur of a dead insect thi on

chapter xv
suicid or hypnosi
you do not imit the unfamiliar you do not counterfeit a thing of
which you know noth that is obviou the simul of death
therefor impli a certain knowledg of death
well ha the insect or rather ha ani kind of anim a
presenti that it life cannot last for ever doe the perturb
problem of an end occur to it dens brain i have associ a great
deal with anim i have live on intim term with them and i have
never observ anyth to justifi me in sai ye the anim with
it humbler destini is spare that apprehens of the hour of death
which constitut at onc our torment and our great
like the child still in the limbo of unconsci it enjoi the
present without take thought of the futur free from the bitter
of a prospect end it live in the bliss calm of ignor
it is our alon to forese the brief of our dai it is our
alon anxious to question the grave regard the last sleep
moreov thi glimps of the inevit destruct call for a
certain matur of mind and for that reason is rather late in
develop i had a touch exampl of it thi veri week
a pretti littl kitten the joi of all the household after languidli
drag itself about for a coupl of dai di in the night next
morn the children found it ly stark in it basket gener
afflict anna especi a littl girl of four consid with a
pensiv glanc the littl friend with which she had so often plai
she pet it call it offer it a drop of milk in a cup
kitti wont plai said the child she doesnt want my breakfast ani
more she asleep iv never seen her sleep like thi befor when
will she wake up
thi simplic in the presenc of death harsh problem wrung my
heart hastili i led the girl awai from the sight and had the dead
kitten secretli buri as from thi time onward it no longer
appear by the tabl at mealtim the griefstricken child at last
understood that she had seen her littl friend sleep the profound
slumber that know no awak for the first time a vagu idea of
death found it wai into her mind
ha the insect the signal honour of know what we do not know in our
earli childhood at a time when thought is alreadi manifest itself
far superior howev feebl it be to the dull understand of the
anim ha it the power to forese an end an attribut which in
it case would be inconveni and useless befor decid let us
consult not the abstrus theori of scienc a doubt guid but
the turkei an emin truth on
i recal on of the most vivid memori that remain to me from my
brief sojourn at the royal colleg of rodez so thei call it then
todai thei call it a grammarschool what improv as the world
grow older
the thricebless thursdai had come our bit of translat wa done
our dozen greek root had been learnt by heart and we troop down to
the far end of the vallei so mani band of madcap with our trouser
turn up to our knee we exploit artless fishermen that we were
the peac water of the river the aveyron what we hope to catch
wa the loach no bigger than our littl finger but tempt thank
to hi immobl on the sand amid the waterwe we fulli expect
to transfix him with our trident a fork
thi miracul catch the object of such shout of triumph when it
succeed wa veri rare vouchsaf to us the loach the rascal
saw the fork come and with three stroke of hi tail disappear
we found compens in the appletre in the neighbour pastur
the appl ha from all time been the urchin delight abov all when
pluck from a tree which doe not belong to him our pocket were
soon cram with the forbidden fruit
anoth distract await us flock of turkei were not rare
roam at their own sweet will and gobbl up the locust around the
farm if no watcher hove in sight we had great sport each of us
would seiz a turkei tuck her head under her wing rock it in thi
attitud for a moment and then place her on the ground ly on her
side the bird no longer budg the whole flock of turkei wa
subject to our hypnot handl and the meadow assum the aspect
of a battlefield strewn with the dead and dy
and now look out for the farmer wife the loud gobbl of the
harass bird had told her of our wick prank she would run up
arm with a whip but we had good leg in those dai and we had a
good laugh too behind the hedg which favour our retreat
o delight dai when we put the turkei to sleep can i recov the
skill which i then possess todai it is no longer the play trick
of a schoolboi it is a matter of seriou research i happen to have
the veri subject that i need a turkeyhen doom soon to be the
victim of our christma merrymak i repeat with her the method of
manipul which i emploi so successfulli on the bank of the
aveyron i tuck her head well under her wing and mold it in thi
attitud with both hand i rock the bird gentli up and down for a
coupl of minut
the strang effect is produc my childhood manoeuvr obtain no
better result laid on the ground on her side and left to herself my
patient is a lifeless bundl on would think her dead if a slight
rise and fall of the plumag did not reveal the breath she look
realli like a dead bird which in a last convuls had drawn it
chill feet with their shrivel toe under it belli the
spectacl ha a tragic air and i feel overcom by a certain anxieti
when i gaze upon the result of my evil spell poor turkei what if
she were never to wake again
we need not be afraid she is wake she stand up stagger a
littl it is true with droop tail and a shamefac express
that soon pass off not a trace of it remain in a few moment the
bird is onc more what it wa befor the experi
thi torpor the mean between true sleep and death is of variabl
durat when repeatedli provok in my turkeyhen with suitabl
interv of repos immobl last sometim for half an hour and
sometim for a few minut here as in the insect it would be veri
difficult to analys the caus of these differ with the
guineafowl i succe even better the torpor last so long that i
becom alarm by the bird condit the plumag reveal no trace
of breath i ask myself anxious whether the bird is not
actual dead i push it a littl wai along the ground with my foot
the patient doe not stir i do it again and lo the guineafowl
free her head stand up regain her balanc and scurri off her
state of lethargi ha last more than half an hour
now for the goos i have none the garden next door trust me with
hi she is brought to my hous which she fill with her trumpet
as she waddl about shortli afterward there is absolut silenc
the webfoot amazon is ly on the ground with her head tuck
under her wing her immobl is as profound and as prolong as that
of the turkei and the guineafowl
it is the hen turn now and the duck thei too succumb but so it
seem to me less persist can it be that my hypnot trick ar
less efficaci with small bird than with larg on to judg by
the pigeon thi mai well be so he yield to my art onli to the
extent of two minut sleep a still smaller bird a greenfinch is
even more refractori all that i obtain from him is a few second
drowsi
it would appear then that in proport as the activ is
concentr in a bodi of less volum the torpor ha less hold the
insect ha alreadi shown us thi the giant scarit doe not stir for
an hour while the smoothskin scarit a pigmi weari my
persist in turn him over the larg cloudi bupresti submit to
my manoeuvr for a long period wherea the glitter bupresti a
pigmi again obstin refus to do so
we will leav on on side as insuffici investig the
influenc of the bodili mass and rememb onli thi fact that it is
possibl by a veri simpl artific to reduc a bird to a condit
of appar death do my goos my turkei and the other resort to
trickeri with the object of deceiv their tormentor it is certain
that none of them think of sham dead thei ar actual immers
in a deep torpor in a word thei ar hypnot
these fact have long been known thei ar perhap the first in date
in the scienc of hypnosi or artifici sleep how did we the littl
rodez schoolboi learn the secret of the turkei slumber it wa
certainli not in our book come from no on know where
indestruct as everyth that enter into children game it wa
hand down from time immemori from on initi to anoth
thing ar just the same todai in my villag of srignan where there
ar number of youth adept in the art of put poultri to sleep
scienc often ha veri humbl begin there is noth to tell us
that the mischief of a pack of idl urchin is not the startingpoint
of our knowledg of hypnosi
i have just been practis on insect trick which to all appear
ar as pueril as those which we practis on the turkei in the dai
when the farmer wife us to run after us crack her whip do not
laugh a seriou problem loom behind thi artless
my insect condit bear a strang resembl to that of my
poultri both present the imag of death inertia the contract of
convuls limb in both again the immobl is dispel befor it
time by the agenc of a stimulu by sound in the case of the bird by
light in that of the insect silenc dark and tranquil
prolong it it durat vari greatli in differ speci and
appear to increas with corpul
among ourselv who ar veri unequ subject for induc sleep the
hypnotist is oblig to pick and choos he succe with on and not
with anoth similarli among the insect a select is necessari
for thei do not all of them by a long wai respond to the
experiment attempt my best subject have been the giant scarit
and the cloudi bupresti but how mani other have resist quit
indomit or remain motionless for onli a few second
the insect return to the activ state present certain peculiar
which ar well worthi of attent the kei to the problem li here
let us return for a moment to the patient who have been subject to
the ordeal of ether these ar realli hypnot thei do not remain
motionless by wai of a ruse there is no doubt upon that point thei
ar actual on the threshold of death and if i did not take them in
good time out of the flask in which a few drop of ether have been
evapor thei would never recov from the torpor whose last stage
is death
now what symptom herald their return to activ we know the
symptom the tarsi trembl the palpi quiver the antenn wave to and
fro a man emerg from a deep sleep stretch hi limb yawn and
rub hi ey the insect awak from the ether sleep likewis ha
it own fashion of mark it recoveri of conscious it flutter
it tini digit and the more mobil of it organ
let us now consid an insect which upset by a shock perturb by
some sort of excit is believ to be sham dead ly on it
back the return to activ is announc exactli in the same fashion
and in the same order as after the stupefi effect of ether first
the tarsi quiver then the palpi and antenn wave feebli to and fro
if the creatur were realli sham what need would it have of these
minut preliminari to the awaken onc the danger ha
disappear or is deem to have done so why doe the insect not
swiftli get upon it feet to make off as quickli as possibl instead
of dalli with untim pretenc i am quit sure that onc the
bear wa gone the comrad who had sham dead under the anim
nose did not think of wast time in stretch himself or rub
hi ey he jump up at onc and took to hi heel
and the insect is suppos to carri it cun to the length of
counterfeit resuscit down to the least detail no no and
again no it would be mad those quiver of the tarsi those
awaken movement of the palpi and antenn ar the obviou proof of
a genuin torpor now come to an end a torpor similar to that
induc by ether but less intens thei show that the insect struck
motionless by my artific is not sham dead as the vulgar idiom
ha it and as the fashion theori repeat it is realli
hypnot
a shock which disturb it nervecentr an abrupt fright which
seiz upon it reduc it to a state of somnol like that of the
bird which is swung for a second or two with it head under it wing
a sudden terror sometim depriv us human be of the power of
movement sometim kill us why should not the insect organ so
delic and subtl give wai beneath the grip of fear and momentarili
succumb if the emot be slight the insect shrink into itself for
an instant quickli recov and make off if it be profound
hypnosi superven with it prolong immobl
the insect which know noth of death and therefor cannot
counterfeit it know noth either of suicid that desper mean
of cut short excess miseri no authent exampl ha ever been
given to my knowledg of an anim of ani kind rob itself of it
own life that those most richli endow with the capac of
affect sometim allow themselv to die of grief i grant you but
there is a great differ between thi and stab on self or
cut on throat
yet the recollect occur to me of the scorpion suicid sworn to
by some deni by other what truth is there in the stori of the
scorpion who surround by a circl of fire put an end to hi
suffer by stab himself with hi poison sting let us see for
ourselv
circumst favour me i am at thi moment rear in larg earthen
pan with a bed of sand and with potsherd for shelter a hideou
menageri which hardli come up to my expect as regard the
studi of morals1 i will profit by it in anoth wai it consist of
some twentyfour specimen of buthu occitanu the larg white

on the effect of it sting i person have noth to sai have
alwai avoid by a littl caution the danger to which my relat
with the formid captiv in my studi might have expos me
know noth of it myself i get peopl to tell me of it
woodcutt in particular who from time to time fall victim to
their imprud on of them tell me the follow stori
after have my dinner i wa doze for a moment among my faggot
when i wa rous by a sharp pain it wa like the prick of a redhot
needl i clap my hand to the place sure enough there wa
someth move a scorpion had crept under my trouser and stung me
in the lower part of the calf the ugli beast wa full as long as my
finger like that sir like that
and ad gestur to speech the worthi man extend hi great
forefing thi size did not surpris me while insecthunt i
have seen scorpion as larg
i want to go on with my work he continu but i came out in a
cold sweat and my leg swell up so you could see it swell it got
as big as that sir as big as that
more mimicri our friend spread hi two hand round hi leg at a
distanc so as to denot the girth of a small barrel
ye like that sir like that i had great troubl to get home
though it wa onli half a mile awai the swell crept up and up
next dai it had got so high
a gestur indic the height
ye sir for three dai i couldnt stand up i bore it as well as i
could with my leg stretch out on a chair sodacompress did the
trick and there you ar sir there you ar
anoth woodcutt he add wa also stung in the lower part of the
leg he wa bind faggot togeth at some distanc and had not the
strength to regain hi home he collaps by the side of the road
some men pass by carri him on their shoulder
la cabro morto moussu la cabro morto
the stori of the rustic narrat more vers in mimicri than in
speech doe not seem to me exagger a white scorpion sting is a
veri seriou accid for a human be when stung by hi own kind
the scorpion himself quickli succumb here i have someth better
than the evid of stranger i have my own observ
i take two healthi specimen from my menageri and place them togeth
at the bottom of a glass jar on a layer of sand excit with the tip
of a straw which bring them face to face again whenev thei draw

semicircl and open to keep the adversari at a distanc the tail in
sudden jerk ar flung forward abov the back the poisonphi
clash togeth a tini drop limpid as water bead the point of the

excus what i do not understand nor shall until we tin the meat
on the battlefield for food is our war between nation
we now have authent inform the scorpion sting is fatal
promptli fatal to the scorpion himself let us come to the matter of
suicid such as it ha been describ to us when surround by a
circl of live ember the anim so we ar told stab itself with
it sting and find an end of it torment in voluntari death thi
would be veri fine on the creatur part if it were true we shall
see
in the centr of a ring of burn charcoal i place the largest
specimen from my menageri the bellow increas the glow at the
first smart of the heat the anim move backward within the circl
of fire it collid by inadvert with the burn barrier now
follow a disorderli retreat in everi direct at random renew
the agon contact at each attempt to escap the burn is
repeat more sever than befor the anim becom frantic it
dart forward and scorch itself in a desper frenzi it
brandish it weapon crook it straighten it lai it down flat
and rais it again all with such disorderli hast that i am quit
unabl to follow it movement accur
the moment ought to have come for the scorpion to releas himself from
hi tortur with a blow of the stiletto and inde with a sudden
spasm the longsuff creatur becom motionless li at
fulllength flat upon the ground there is not a movement the
inertia is complet is the scorpion dead it realli look like it
perhap he ha pink himself with a thrust of hi sting that escap
me in the turmoil of the last effort if he ha actual stab
himself if he ha resort to suicid then he is dead beyond a
doubt we have just seen how quickli he succumb to hi own venom
in my uncertainti i pick up the appar dead bodi with the tip of
my forcep and lai it on a bed of cool sand an hour later the
alleg corps return to life as lusti as befor the ordeal i
repeat the process with a second and third specimen the result ar
the same after the frantic plung of the desper victim we have
the same sudden inertia with the creatur sprawl flat as though
struck by lightn and the same return to life on the cool sand
it seem probabl that those who invent the stori of the scorpion
commit suicid were deceiv by thi sudden swoon thi paralys
spasm into which the high temperatur of the enclosur throw the
exasper beast too quickli convinc thei left the victim to burn

good time from it circl of fire thei would have seen the appar
dead scorpion return to life and thu assert it profound ignor of

apart from man no live thing know the last resourc of a voluntari
end becaus none ha a knowledg of death as for us to feel that we

elev abov the commonalti of the anim world but in point of
fact it becom cowardic if from the possibl we pass to action
he who propos to go to that length should at least repeat to himself
what confuciu the great philosoph of the yellow race said
fiveandtwenti centuri ago have surpris a stranger in the
wood fix to the branch of a tree a rope wherewith to hang himself
the chines sage address him in word the gist of which wa as
follow
howev great your misfortun the greatest of all would be to yield
to despair all the rest can be repair thi on is irrepar do
not believ that all is lost for you and try to convinc yourself of a
truth which ha been prove indisput by the experi of the
centuri and that truth is thi so long as a man ha life there is
no need for him to despair he mai pass from the greatest miseri to
the greatest joi from the greatest misfortun to the highest
felic take courag and as though you were thi veri dai begin
to recogn the valu of life strive at everi moment to make the
most of it
thi humdrum chines philosophi is not without merit it suggest the
moral of the fabulist

crioceri merdigera lin without translat it or abov all
repeat it decenc forbid i have never been abl to understand
why natur histori need inflict upon a love flower or an engag

as a matter of fact our crioceri so illtreat by the

let us wait a few dai and return to the lili which is gradual
grow taller and begin to show it bud gather togeth in a

well thi filth move travel slowli along let us overcom our

at the same time the coat of dung is under continu repair be

on satisfact is vouchsaf me in these horribl orgi i see that

not even the lilydwel with her dirti wai is safe her grub is
as often the prei of anoth tachina larger than that of the field
crioceri the parasit i am convinc doe not sow her egg upon
the victim so long as the latter is wrap in it repuls
greatcoat but a moment imprud give her a favour
opportun
when the time come for the grub to buri itself in the ground there
to undergo the transform it lai asid it mantl with the
object perhap of eas itself when it descend from the top of the
plant or els with the object of take a bath in that kindli
sunlight whereof it ha hitherto tast so littl under it moist
coverlet thi nake journei over the leav the last joi of it
larval life is fatal to the travel up come the tachina who
find a clean skin all sleek with fat lose no time in dab her
egg upon it
a censu of the intact and of the injur larv provid us with
particular which agre with what we foresaw from the natur of their
respect live the most expos to parasit is the field
crioceri whose larva live in the open air without ani sort of
protect next come the twelvespot crioceri who is
establish in the asparagusberri from her earli infanc the most
favour is the lilybeetl who while a grub make an ulster of her
excret
for the second time we ar here confront by three insect which
look as if thei had all come out of on mould so much ar thei alik
in shape if the costum were not differ and the size dissimilar
we should not know how to tell on from anoth and thi pronounc
resembl in figur is accompani by a no less pronounc lack of
resembl in instinct
the evacu that soil it back cannot have inspir the hermit
live in cleanli retir insid it globe the occup of the
asparagusberri did not advis the third to live in the open and
wander like an acrobat through the leafag none of the three ha
initi the custom of the other two all thi seem to me as clear
as daylight if thei have issu from the same stock how have thei
acquir such dissimilar talent
furthermor have these talent develop by degre the lilybeetl
is prepar to tell us her grub let us suppos onc conceiv the
notion when torment by the tachina of make the stercor slit
open abov by accid with no definit purpos in view it empti
the content of it intestin over it back the natti fly hesit
in the presenc of thi filth the grub in it cun recogn
as time went on the benefit to be deriv from it poultic and what
at first wa an unpremedit pollut becam a prudent custom
as success follow upon success with the aid of the centuri of
cours for these invent alwai take centuri the dung overcoat
wa extend from the hinder end to the forepart right down to the
forehead find itself the gainer by thi invent set the
parasit at defianc under it coverlet the grub made a strict law of
what wa an accid and the crioceri faithfulli hand down the
repuls greatcoat to her offspr
so far thi is not so bad but thing now begin to becom complic
if the insect wa realli the inventor of it defens method if it
discov for itself the advantag of hide under it ordur i look
to it ingenu to keep up the trick until the precis moment ha
come for buri itself but on the contrari it undress itself
some time beforehand it wander about nake take the air on the
leav at a time when it fair round belli is more than ever like
to tempt the fly it complet forget on it last dai the prudenc
which it acquir by the long apprenticeship of the centuri
thi sudden chang of purpos thi heedless in the face of danger
tell me that the insect forget noth becaus it ha learnt
noth becaus it ha invent noth when the instinct were
be distribut it receiv as it share the overcoat of whose
method it is ignor though it benefit by it advantag it ha
not acquir it by success stage follow by a sudden halt at the
most danger moment the moment most calcul to inspir it with
distrust it is no more and no less gift than it wa in the
begin and is unabl in ani wai to alter it tactic against the
tachina and it other enemi
nevertheless we must not be in a hurri to attribut to the garment of
filth the exclus function of protect the grub against the
parasit it is difficult to see in what respect the lilygrub is more
deserv than the asparagusgrub which possess no defens art
perhap it is less fruit and to make up for the poverti of the
ovari boast an ingenu which safeguard the race nor is there
anyth to tell us that the soft coverlet is not at the same time a
shelter which screen a too sensit skin from the sun and if it
were a mere fallal a furbelow of larval coquetri even that would
not surpris me the insect ha tast which we cannot judg by our
own let us end with a doubt and proce
mai is not over when the grub now fullygrown leav the lili and
buri itself at the foot of the plant at no great depth work
with it head and rump it forc back the earth and make itself a
round recess the size of a pea to turn the cell into a hollow pill
which will not be liabl to collaps all that remain for it to do is
to drench the wall with a glue which soon set and grip the sand
to observ thi work of consolid i unearth some unfinish cell
and make an open which enabl me to watch the grub at work the
hermit is at the window in a moment a stream of froth pour from hi
mouth like beatenup white of egg he slaver spit profus he
make hi product effervesc and lai it on the edg of the breach
with a few spurt of froth the open is plug
i collect other grub at the moment of their inter and instal
them in glass tube with a few tini bit of paper which will serv
them as a prop there is no sand no buildingmateri other than the

the two asparagusbeetl ar likewis profici dribbler worthi
rival of their kinswoman of the lili in the matter of build in
all three case the underground shell ha the same shape and the same
structur
when after a subterranean visit of two month durat the
lilybeetl return to the surfac in her adult form a botan
problem remain to be solv befor the histori of the insect is
complet we ar now at the height of summer the lili have had
their dai a dry leafless stick surmount by a few tatter
capsul is all that is left of the magnific plant of the spring
onli the onionlik bulb remain a littl wai down there postpon
the process of veget it wait for the steadi rain of the
autumn which will renew it strength and make it burgeon into a sheaf
of leav
how doe the lilybeetl live dure the summer befor the return of
the green foliag dear to it race doe it fast dure the extrem
heat if abstin is it rule of life in thi season of veget
dearth why doe it emerg from underground why doe it abandon it
shell where it could sleep so peacefulli without the necess of
eat can it be need of food that drive it from the substratum and
send it to the sunlight so soon as the wingcas have assum their
vermilion hue it is veri like for the rest let us look into the
matter
on the ruin stem of my white lili i find a portion cover with a
scrap of green skin i set it befor the prison in my jar who
emerg from their sandi bed a dai or two ago thei attack it with an
appetit which is extrem conclus the green morsel is strip
bare to the wood soon i have noth left in the wai of their
regul diet to offer my famish captiv i know that all the
lili nativ or exot the turk cap lili or martagon the lili
of chalcedon the tiger lili and mani other ar to their tast i do
not forget that the crown imperi fritillari and the persian
fritillari ar equal welcom but most of these delic plant have
refus the hospit of my two acr of pebbl and those which it
is more or less possibl for me to grow ar now as tatter as the
common lili there is not a patch of green left on them
in botani the lili give it name to the famili of the liliac of
which it is the lead repres those who feed upon the lili
ought also in the absenc of anyth better to accept the other
plant of the same group thi is my opinion at first it is not that
of the crioceri who know more than i do about the virtu of
plant
the famili of the liliac is subdivid into three tribe the
lili the daffodil and the asparagus not ani of the daffodil
tribe suit my famish prison who allow themselv to die of
inanit on the leav of the follow genera the onli varieti
with which the modest resourc of my garden have allow me to
experi asphodel funkia or niob agapanthu or african lili
tritelia hemeroc or dai lili tritoma garlic ornithogalum or
star of bethlehem squill hyacinth muscari or grapehyacinth i
record for whom it mai concern thi profound contempt of the
crioceri for the daffodil an insect opinion is not to be
despis it tell us that we should obtain a more natur arrang
by separ the daffodil farther from the lili
in the first of the three tribe the classic white lili the plant
prefer by the insect take the chief place next come the other
lili and the fritillari a diet almost as much sought after and
lastli the tulip which the season is too far advanc to allow me to
submit for the approv of the crioceri
the third tribe had a great surpris in store for me the red
crioceri fed though with a veri scorn tooth on the foliag of
the asparagu the favourit dish of the field crioceri and the
twelvespot crioceri on the other hand she feast raptur
on the lili of the vallei convallaria maiali and on solomon
seal polygonatum vulgar both of which ar so differ from the
lili to ani ey untrain in the niceti of botan analysi
she did more she brows with everi appear of a content
stomach on a prickli creeper smilax aspera which tangl itself
in the hedg with it corkscrew tendril and produc in the autumn
grace cluster of small red berri which ar us for christma
decor the fullydevelop leav ar too hard for her too
tough she want the tender tip of the nascent foliag when i take
thi precaut i can feed her on the intract vine as readili as
on the lili
the fact that the smilax is accept give me confid in the
prickli butchersbroom ruscu aculeatu anoth shrub of sturdi
constitut admit to the famili rejoic at christma becaus
of it handsom green leav and it red berri which ar like big
coral bead in order not to discourag the consum with leav that
ar too hard i select some young seedl newli sprout and still
bear the round berri the nutrit gourd hang at their base
my precaut lead to noth the insect obstin refus the

these botan detail tell us that the criocer which hatch earli
in the middl of summer have no reason to fear famin if the
lilybeetl can no longer find her favourit plant she can brows
upon solomon seal and smilax not to mention the lili of the vallei

after learn the origin of the object he would be no less doubt
as to the natur of the materi or rather of their cement water
will not soften will not disintegr the shell thi must be so
els the first shower of rain would reduc the grub garment to pulp
fire doe not affect it greatli either when expos to the flame of a
candl the jar without chang shape lose it brown colour and
assum the tint of burnt ferrugin earth the groundwork of the
materi therefor is of a miner natur it remain for us to
discov what the cement can be that give the earthi element it
brown colour hold it togeth and make it solid
the grub is ever on it guard at the least flurri it shrink into
it shell and doe not budg for a long time let us be as patient as
the grub we shall sure some dai or other manag to surpris it at
work and inde i do it suddenli back into it jar disappear
insid entir in a moment it reappear carri a brown pellet in
it mandibl it knead the pellet and work it up with a littl
earth gather on the threshold of it dwell it soften the

on the edg of the sheath
the leg take no part in the job onli the mandibl and the palpi

bring a second clod which is prepar and us in the same manner
five or six time over it repeat the process until the whole
circumfer of the mouth ha been increas by the addit of a

the potter compound as we have seen consist of two ingredi
on of these the first earth that come to hand is collect on the
threshold of the workshop the other is fetch from insid the pot
for each time that the grub return i see it carri a brown pellet
in it teeth what doe it keep in the backshop though we can
scarc find out by direct observ we can at least guess
observ that the jar is absolut close behind without the smallest
wastepip by which the physiolog need from which the grub is
certainli not immun can be reliev the grub is box in and never
stir out of door what becom of it excret well thei ar
evacu at the bottom of the pot by a gentl movement of the rump
the product is spread upon the wall strengthen the coat and
give it a velvet line
it is better than a line it is a preciou store of putti when the
grub want to repair it shell or to enlarg it to fit it figur
which increas daili it proce to clean out it cesspool it
turn round and with the tip of it mandibl collect singli from
the back the brown pellet which it ha onli to work up with a littl
earth to make a ceram past of the highest qualiti
observ also that the grub potteri is shape like the leg of our
pegtop trouser and is wider insid than at the open thi
excess girth ha it obviou us it enabl the anim to bend and
turn when the content of the cesspit ar need for a fresh cours
of masonri
a garment should be neither too short nor too tight it is not enough
to add a piec which lengthen it as the bodi grow longer we must
also see that it ha suffici ful not to hamper the wearer and
to give him liberti of movement
the snail and all the mollusc with turbin shell increas the
diamet of their corkscrew staircas by degre so that the last
whorl is alwai an exact measur of their actual condit the lower
whorl those of childhood when thei becom too narrow ar not
abandon it is true thei becom lumberroom in which the organ of
least import to activ life find shelter drawn out into a slender

stori which increas in capac
the big broken bulimu that lover of crumbl wall and limeston
rock lean in the sun sacrific the grace of symmetri to

them altogeth and move higher up into the spaciou staircas of
recent format he close the occupi part with a stout
partitionwal at the back then dash against the sharp stone he
chip off the superflu portion the hovel not fit to live in the
broken shell lose it accur form in the process but gain in
light
the clythra doe not emploi the bulimu method it also disdain that
of our dressmak who split the overtight garment and let in a piec
of suitabl width between the edg of the open to break the jar
when it becom too small would be a wil wast of materi to
split it lengthwis and increas it capac by insert a strip
would be an imprud expedi which would expos the occup to
danger dure the slow work of repair the hermit of the jar can do
better than that it know how to enlarg it gown while leav it
except for it ful as it wa befor
it paradox method is thi of the line it make cloth bring
to the outsid what wa insid littl by littl as the need make
itself felt the grub scrape and strip the interior of it cell
reduc to a soft past by mean of a littl putti furnish by the
intestin the scrape ar appli over the whole of the outer
surfac down to the far end which the grub thank to it perfect
flexibl is abl to reach without take too much troubl or
leav it hous
thi turn of the coat is accomplish with a delic precis
which preserv the symmetr arrang of the ornament ridg
lastli it increas the capac by a gradual transfer of the
materi from the insid to the outsid thi method of renew the
old coat is so accur that noth is thrown asid noth treat
as useless not even the babywear which remain encrust in the
keyston at the origin top of the structur
if fresh materi were not ad obvious the jar would gain in
size at the cost of thick the shell would becom too thin by
dint of be turn in order to make space and would sooner or later
lack the requisit solid the grub guard against that it ha in
front of it as much earth as it can wish for it keep putti in a
backshop and the factori which produc it never slack work there
is noth to prevent it from thicken the structur at will and
ad as much materi as it think proper to the inner scrape

the gener form of the egg is still that of a truncat ellipsoid
the ornament vari in the egg of the golden cryptocephalu and the
ilex cryptocephalu thei consist of eight flatten wavi rib
wind corkscrewwis in those of the twospot cryptocephalu
thei take the form of spiral row of pit
what can thi envelop be so remark for it eleg with it
spiral mould it thimblepit and it hopscal a few littl
accident fact put me on the right track to begin with i acquir
the certainti that the egg doe not descend from the ovari as i find
it on the ground it ornament incompat with a gentl
glide movement had alreadi told me as much i now have a clear
proof
mingl with the normal egg of both the golden cryptocephalu and the
longleg clythra i find other which differ in no respect from the
usual run of insect egg the egg ar perfectli smooth with a
soft paleyellow shell as the cage contain no other insect than
the clythra under consider or the cryptocephalu i cannot be
mistaken as to the origin of my find
moreov if ani doubt remain thei would be dispel by the
follow evid in addit to the bare yellow egg there ar
some whose base is set in a tini brown pit cup obvious the work
of either the twospot cryptocephalu or the longleg clythra
accord to the cage but unfinish work which halfcloth the
egg as it left the ovari and then when the dressmateri ran
short or someth went wrong with the machineri allow it to cross
the outer threshold in the like of an acorn fix in it cup
noth could be prettier than thi yellow egg stand in it
artist eggcup nor could anyth tell us more conclus where
the jewel is manufactur it is in the cloaca the chamber common to
the oviduct and the intestin that the bird wrap it egg in a
calcar shell often decor it with magnific hue
olivegreen for the nightingal skyblu for the wheatear soft pink
for the icterin warbler it is in the cloaca also that the clythra
and the cryptocephalu produc the eleg armour of their egg
it remain to decid upon the materi emploi from it horni
appear there is reason to believ that the littl barrel of the
taxicorn clythra and the scale of the fourspot clythra ar the
product of a special secret and now that it is too late i much
regret that i neglect to look for the apparatu yield thi
secret in the neighbourhood of the cloaca as for the thing so
prettili wrought by the longleg clythra and the cryptocephali let
us admit without fals shame that it is made of fcal matter
the proof is furnish by certain specimen by no mean rare in the
golden cryptocephalu in which the customari brown is replac by an
unmistak green the sign of a veget pulp in cours of time
these green egg turn brown and becom like the other no doubt by
reason of an oxid which alter the natur qualiti of the
digest product still further the egg enter the cloaca in a
soft and utterli nake state receiv an artist coat of the
intestin dross even as the hen egg is cover by a shell form
of the chalki secret
materiem superabat opu nam mulcib illic
quora celerat
said ovid in hi descript of the palac of the sun the poet had
preciou metal and gem wherewith to build hi imaginari marvel what
ha the clythra wherewith to achiev it ideal jewel it ha the
shame materi whose name is banish from decent speech and which
is the mulcib the vulcan the artistengrav that engrav the
cover of the egg so prettili it is the termin sewer the cloaca
roll the materi flute it twist it into spiral deck it with
chain of littl pit and make it up into a scali suit of armour
show how natur laugh at our paltri standard of valu and how
well abl she is to convert the sordid into the beauti
in the bird the eggshel is a temporari defens cell which at
hatchingtim is broken and abandon and is henceforth useless made
of horni matter or stercor past the shell of the clythra and the
cryptocephalu is on the contrari a perman refug which the
insect will never leav so long as it remain a larva here the grub
is born with a readymad garment of rare eleg and an exact fit
a garment which it onli ha to enlarg littl by littl in the
origin manner describ abov the shell shape like a littl
barrel or thimbl is open in front there is noth therefor to
break noth to cast asid at the moment of hatch except perhap
the actual envelop of the egg directli thi membran is burst the
tini creatur is free with a handsom carv jacket a legaci from
it mother
let us indulg in a crazi dream and imagin young bird which keep the
eggshel intact save for an open through which thei pass their
head and which all their live long remain clad in thi shell on
condit that thei themselv enlarg it as thei grow thi absurd
dream is realiz by our grub it is dress in the shell of it egg
expand by degre as the grub itself grow bigger
in juli all my collect of egg ar hatch each isol in a
larg cup cover with a slip of glass which will moder the
evapor what an interest famili my vermin ar swarm amid
the miscellan veget refus with which i have furnish the
premis thei all move along with tini step drag their shell
which thei carri lift on a slant thei come halfwai out and suddenli
pop in again thei tumbl over if thei mere attempt to scale a sprig
of moss pick themselv up again forg ahead and cast about at
random
hunger we can no longer doubt is the caus of thi agit what
shall i give my famish nursel thei ar vegetarian there can
be no doubt whatev about that but thi is not enough to settl the
bill of fare what would happen under the natur condit rear
the insect in cage i find the egg scatter at random on the
ground the mother drop them carelessli here and there from the top
of the bough where she is refresh herself by soberli notch some
tender leaf the taxicorn clythra fit a long stalk to her egg and
fix them in cluster on the foliag while i cannot yet make up my
mind in the absenc of direct observ whether the newborn larva
cut the suspensionthread itself or whether the thread is broken
mere as a result of dry up sooner or later these egg ar ly
on the ground like the other
the same thing must happen outsid my cage the egg of the clythr
and the cryptocephali ar scatter over the ground beneath the tree
or plant on which the adult feed
now what do we find under the shelter of the oak turf dead leav
more or less pickl by decai dry twig case in lichen broken
stone with cushion of moss and lastli mould the final residu of
veget matter wrought upon by time under the tuft of the
centauri on which the golden cryptocephalu brows li a black bed
of the miscellan refus of the plant
i try a littl of everyth but noth answer my expect veri
posit i observ nevertheless that a few disdain mouth
ar taken a littl bit here a littl bit there enough to tell me
the natur of the first layer which the grub add to it natal
sheath with the except of the taxicorn clythra whose egg with
it suspensionstalk seem to denot rather special habit i see my
sever charg begin to prolong their shell with a brown past
similar in appear to that with whose manufactur and employ we
ar alreadi familiar
discourag by a food which doe not suit them and perhap also tri
by a season of except drouth my young potter soon relinquish
their task thei die after ad a shallow rim to their pot
onli the longleg clythra thrive and repai me ampli for my
troublesom nurs i provid it with chip of old bark taken from
the first tree to hand the oak the oliv the figtre and mani
other i soften them by steep them for a short time in water the
corklik crust howev ar not what my boarder eat the actual
food the butter on the bread is on the surfac there is a littl
here of all that the first begin of veget life add to old
treetrunk all that break up decrepit ag to turn it into perpetu
youth
there ar tuft of moss hardli a twelfth of an inch in height which
were sleep droughtili under the merciless sun of the dogdai but
which a bath in a glass of water awaken at onc thei now displai
their ring of green leaflet brighten up and restor to life for a
few hour there ar leprou effloresc with their white or
yellow dust tini lichen radiat in ashgrei strap and cover
with glaucou whiteedg shield great round ey that seem to gaze
from the depth of the limbo in which dead matter come to life again
there ar collema which after a shower becom dark and bloat and
shake like jelli sphria whose pustul stand out like eboni
teat full of myriad of tini sac each contain eight pretti
seed a glanc through the microscop at the content of on of these
teat a speck onli just visibl to the ey reveal an astound
world an infin of procr wealth in an atom ah what a
beauti thing life is even on a chip of rotten bark no bigger than
a fingernail what a garden what a treasurehous
thi is the best pastur put to the test my clythr graze upon it
gather in dens herd at the most luxuri spot on would take
thi heap for pinch of some brown model seed or other the
snapdragon for instanc but these particular seed push and swai
if on of them move the least bit the shell all clash togeth
other wander about in search of a good place stagger and
tumbl under the weight of the overcoat thei wander at random
through that great and spaciou world the bottom of my cup
not a fortnight ha elaps befor a strip built up on the rim ha
doubl the length of the longleg clythra shell in order to
maintain the capac of the earthenwar jar in proport to the size
of the grub which ha been grow from dai to dai the recent
portion the work of the larva is veri plainli distinguish from
the origin shell the product of the mother it is smooth over it
whole extent wherea the rest is ornament with tini hole arrang

the same time longer the dust taken from it onc more knead into
