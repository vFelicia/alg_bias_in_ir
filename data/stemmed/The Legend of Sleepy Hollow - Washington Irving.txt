the legend of sleepi hollow
by washington irv
found among the paper of the late diedrich knickerbock
a pleas land of drowsi head it wa
of dream that wave befor the halfshut ey
and of gai castl in the cloud that pass
forev flush round a summer sky
castl of indol
in the bosom of on of those spaciou cove which indent the eastern
shore of the hudson at that broad expans of the river denomin
by the ancient dutch navig the tappan zee and where thei alwai
prudent shorten sail and implor the protect of st nichola
when thei cross there li a small market town or rural port which
by some is call greensburgh but which is more gener and properli
known by the name of tarri town thi name wa given we ar told in
former dai by the good housew of the adjac countri from the
inveter propens of their husband to linger about the villag
tavern on market dai be that as it mai i do not vouch for the fact
but mere advert to it for the sake of be precis and authent
not far from thi villag perhap about two mile there is a littl
vallei or rather lap of land among high hill which is on of the
quietest place in the whole world a small brook glide through it
with just murmur enough to lull on to repos and the occasion
whistl of a quail or tap of a woodpeck is almost the onli sound
that ever break in upon the uniform tranquil
i recollect that when a stripl my first exploit in
squirrelshoot wa in a grove of tall walnuttre that shade on
side of the vallei i had wander into it at noontim when all natur
is peculiarli quiet and wa startl by the roar of my own gun as it
broke the sabbath still around and wa prolong and reverber
by the angri echo if ever i should wish for a retreat whither i might
steal from the world and it distract and dream quietli awai the
remnant of a troubl life i know of none more promis than thi
littl vallei
from the listless repos of the place and the peculiar charact of it
inhabit who ar descend from the origin dutch settler thi
sequest glen ha long been known by the name of sleepi hollow and
it rustic lad ar call the sleepi hollow boi throughout all the
neighbor countri a drowsi dreami influenc seem to hang over the
land and to pervad the veri atmospher some sai that the place
wa bewitch by a high german doctor dure the earli dai of the
settlement other that an old indian chief the prophet or wizard of
hi tribe held hi powwow there befor the countri wa discov by
master hendrick hudson certain it is the place still continu under
the swai of some witch power that hold a spell over the mind of
the good peopl caus them to walk in a continu reveri thei ar
given to all kind of marvel belief ar subject to tranc and
vision and frequent see strang sight and hear music and voic in
the air the whole neighborhood abound with local tale haunt spot
and twilight superstit star shoot and meteor glare often across
the vallei than in ani other part of the countri and the nightmar
with her whole ninefold seem to make it the favorit scene of her
gambol
the domin spirit howev that haunt thi enchant region and
seem to be commanderinchief of all the power of the air is the
apparit of a figur on horseback without a head it is said by some
to be the ghost of a hessian trooper whose head had been carri awai
by a cannonbal in some nameless battl dure the revolutionari war
and who is ever and anon seen by the countri folk hurri along in
the gloom of night as if on the wing of the wind hi haunt ar not
confin to the vallei but extend at time to the adjac road and
especi to the vicin of a church at no great distanc inde
certain of the most authent historian of those part who have been
care in collect and collat the float fact concern thi
spectr alleg that the bodi of the trooper have been buri in the
churchyard the ghost ride forth to the scene of battl in nightli
quest of hi head and that the rush speed with which he sometim
pass along the hollow like a midnight blast is ow to hi be
belat and in a hurri to get back to the churchyard befor daybreak
such is the gener purport of thi legendari superstit which ha
furnish materi for mani a wild stori in that region of shadow and
the spectr is known at all the countri firesid by the name of the
headless horseman of sleepi hollow
it is remark that the visionari propens i have mention is not

and now the sound of the music from the common room or hall summon

would have thought st vitu himself that bless patron of the danc
wa figur befor you in person he wa the admir of all the
negro who have gather of all ag and size from the farm
and the neighborhood stood form a pyramid of shine black face at

white eyebal and show grin row of ivori from ear to ear how
could the flogger of urchin be otherwis than anim and joyou the
ladi of hi heart wa hi partner in the danc and smile gracious
in repli to all hi amor ogl while brom bone sore smitten
with love and jealousi sat brood by himself in on corner
when the danc wa at an end ichabod wa attract to a knot of the
sager folk who with old van tassel sat smoke at on end of the
piazza gossip over former time and draw out long stori about
the war
thi neighborhood at the time of which i am speak wa on of those
highli favor place which abound with chronicl and great men the
british and american line had run near it dure the war it had
therefor been the scene of maraud and infest with refuge
cowboi and all kind of border chivalri just suffici time had
elaps to enabl each storytel to dress up hi tale with a littl
becom fiction and in the indistinct of hi recollect to
make himself the hero of everi exploit
there wa the stori of doffu martl a larg bluebeard dutchman
who had nearli taken a british frigat with an old iron ninepound
from a mud breastwork onli that hi gun burst at the sixth discharg
and there wa an old gentleman who shall be nameless be too rich
a mynheer to be lightli mention who in the battl of white plain
be an excel master of defenc parri a musketbal with a small
sword insomuch that he absolut felt it whiz round the blade and
glanc off at the hilt in proof of which he wa readi at ani time to
show the sword with the hilt a littl bent there were sever more
that had been equal great in the field not on of whom but wa
persuad that he had a consider hand in bring the war to a happi
termin
but all these were noth to the tale of ghost and apparit that
succeed the neighborhood is rich in legendari treasur of the
kind local tale and superstit thrive best in these shelter
longsettl retreat but ar trampl under foot by the shift
throng that form the popul of most of our countri place besid
there is no encourag for ghost in most of our villag for thei
have scarc had time to finish their first nap and turn themselv in
their grave befor their surviv friend have travel awai from
the neighborhood so that when thei turn out at night to walk their
round thei have no acquaint left to call upon thi is perhap the
reason why we so seldom hear of ghost except in our longestablish
dutch commun
the immedi caus howev of the preval of supernatur stori
in these part wa doubtless ow to the vicin of sleepi hollow
there wa a contagion in the veri air that blew from that haunt
region it breath forth an atmospher of dream and fanci infect
all the land sever of the sleepi hollow peopl were present at
van tassel and as usual were dole out their wild and wonder
legend mani dismal tale were told about funer train and mourn
cri and wail heard and seen about the great tree where the
unfortun major andr wa taken and which stood in the neighborhood
some mention wa made also of the woman in white that haunt the
dark glen at raven rock and wa often heard to shriek on winter night
befor a storm have perish there in the snow the chief part of the
stori howev turn upon the favorit spectr of sleepi hollow the
headless horseman who had been heard sever time of late patrol
the countri and it wa said tether hi hors nightli among the
grave in the churchyard
the sequest situat of thi church seem alwai to have made it a
favorit haunt of troubl spirit it stand on a knoll surround by
locusttre and lofti elm from among which it decent whitewash
wall shine modestli forth like christian puriti beam through the
shade of retir a gentl slope descend from it to a silver sheet
of water border by high tree between which peep mai be caught at
the blue hill of the hudson to look upon it grassgrown yard where
the sunbeam seem to sleep so quietli on would think that there at
least the dead might rest in peac on on side of the church extend a
wide woodi dell along which rave a larg brook among broken rock and
trunk of fallen tree over a deep black part of the stream not far
from the church wa formerli thrown a wooden bridg the road that led
to it and the bridg itself were thickli shade by overhang tree
which cast a gloom about it even in the daytim but occas a
fear dark at night such wa on of the favorit haunt of
the headless horseman and the place where he wa most frequent
encount the tale wa told of old brouwer a most heret
disbeliev in ghost how he met the horseman return from hi forai
into sleepi hollow and wa oblig to get up behind him how thei
gallop over bush and brake over hill and swamp until thei reach
the bridg when the horseman suddenli turn into a skeleton threw old
brouwer into the brook and sprang awai over the treetop with a clap
of thunder
thi stori wa immedi match by a thrice marvel adventur of
brom bone who made light of the gallop hessian as an arrant jockei
he affirm that on return on night from the neighbor villag of
sing sing he had been overtaken by thi midnight trooper that he had
offer to race with him for a bowl of punch and should have won it
too for daredevil beat the goblin hors all hollow but just as thei
came to the church bridg the hessian bolt and vanish in a flash
of fire
all these tale told in that drowsi underton with which men talk in
the dark the counten of the listen onli now and then receiv
a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe sank deep in the mind of
ichabod he repaid them in kind with larg extract from hi invalu
author cotton mather and ad mani marvel event that had taken
place in hi nativ state of connecticut and fear sight which he
had seen in hi nightli walk about sleepi hollow
the revel now gradual broke up the old farmer gather togeth
their famili in their wagon and were heard for some time rattl
along the hollow road and over the distant hill some of the
damsel mount on pillion behind their favorit swain and their
lightheart laughter mingl with the clatter of hoof echo along
the silent woodland sound fainter and fainter until thei gradual
di awayand the late scene of nois and frolic wa all silent and
desert ichabod onli linger behind accord to the custom of
countri lover to have a ttett with the heiress fulli convinc
that he wa now on the high road to success what pass at thi
interview i will not pretend to sai for in fact i do not know
someth howev i fear me must have gone wrong for he certainli
salli forth after no veri great interv with an air quit desol
and chapfallen oh these women these women could that girl have been
plai off ani of her coquettish trick wa her encourag of the
poor pedagogu all a mere sham to secur her conquest of hi rival
heaven onli know not i let it suffic to sai ichabod stole forth
with the air of on who had been sack a henroost rather than a fair
ladi heart without look to the right or left to notic the scene
of rural wealth on which he had so often gloat he went straight to
the stabl and with sever hearti cuff and kick rous hi steed
most uncourt from the comfort quarter in which he wa soundli
sleep dream of mountain of corn and oat and whole vallei of
timothi and clover
it wa the veri witch time of night that ichabod heavyheart and
crestfallen pursu hi travel homeward along the side of the
lofti hill which rise abov tarri town and which he had travers so
cheerili in the afternoon the hour wa as dismal as himself far below
him the tappan zee spread it duski and indistinct wast of water with
here and there the tall mast of a sloop ride quietli at anchor under
the land in the dead hush of midnight he could even hear the bark
of the watchdog from the opposit shore of the hudson but it wa
so vagu and faint as onli to give an idea of hi distanc from thi
faith companion of man now and then too the longdrawn crow
of a cock accident awaken would sound far far off from some
farmhous awai among the hillsbut it wa like a dream sound in hi
ear no sign of life occur near him but occasion the melancholi
chirp of a cricket or perhap the guttur twang of a bullfrog from a
neighbor marsh as if sleep uncomfort and turn suddenli in
hi bed
all the stori of ghost and goblin that he had heard in the afternoon
now came crowd upon hi recollect the night grew darker and
darker the star seem to sink deeper in the sky and drive cloud
occasion hid them from hi sight he had never felt so lone and
dismal he wa moreov approach the veri place where mani of the
scene of the ghost stori had been laid in the centr of the road
stood an enorm tuliptre which tower like a giant abov all the
other tree of the neighborhood and form a kind of landmark it
limb were gnarl and fantast larg enough to form trunk for
ordinari tree twist down almost to the earth and rise again into
the air it wa connect with the tragic stori of the unfortun
andr who had been taken prison hard by and wa univers known
by the name of major andr tree the common peopl regard it with a
mixtur of respect and superstit partli out of sympathi for the
fate of it illstar namesak and partli from the tale of strang
sight and dole lament told concern it
as ichabod approach thi fear tree he began to whistl he thought
hi whistl wa answer it wa but a blast sweep sharpli through
the dry branch as he approach a littl nearer he thought he saw
someth white hang in the midst of the tree he paus and ceas
whistl but on look more narrowli perceiv that it wa a place
where the tree had been scath by lightn and the white wood laid
bare suddenli he heard a groanhi teeth chatter and hi knee
smote against the saddl it wa but the rub of on huge bough upon
anoth as thei were swai about by the breez he pass the tree in
safeti but new peril lai befor him
about two hundr yard from the tree a small brook cross the road
and ran into a marshi and thicklywood glen known by the name of
wilei swamp a few rough log laid side by side serv for a bridg
over thi stream on that side of the road where the brook enter the
wood a group of oak and chestnut mat thick with wild grapevin
threw a cavern gloom over it to pass thi bridg wa the severest
trial it wa at thi ident spot that the unfortun andr wa
captur and under the covert of those chestnut and vine were the
sturdi yeomen conceal who surpris him thi ha ever sinc been
consid a haunt stream and fear ar the feel of the
schoolboi who ha to pass it alon after dark
as he approach the stream hi heart began to thump he summon up
howev all hi resolut gave hi hors half a score of kick in the
rib and attempt to dash briskli across the bridg but instead of
start forward the pervers old anim made a later movement and
ran broadsid against the fenc ichabod whose fear increas with the
delai jerk the rein on the other side and kick lustili with the
contrari foot it wa all in vain hi steed start it is true but
it wa onli to plung to the opposit side of the road into a thicket of
brambl and alder bush the schoolmast now bestow both whip and
heel upon the starvel rib of old gunpowd who dash forward
snuffl and snort but came to a stand just by the bridg with a
sudden that had nearli sent hi rider sprawl over hi head
just at thi moment a plashi tramp by the side of the bridg caught the
sensit ear of ichabod in the dark shadow of the grove on the margin
of the brook he beheld someth huge misshapen and tower it
stir not but seem gather up in the gloom like some gigant
monster readi to spring upon the travel
the hair of the affright pedagogu rose upon hi head with terror
what wa to be done to turn and fly wa now too late and besid
what chanc wa there of escap ghost or goblin if such it wa which
could ride upon the wing of the wind summon up therefor a
show of courag he demand in stammer accent who ar you
he receiv no repli he repeat hi demand in a still more agit
voic still there wa no answer onc more he cudgel the side
of the inflex gunpowd and shut hi ey broke forth with
involuntari fervor into a psalm tune just then the shadowi object of
alarm put itself in motion and with a scrambl and a bound stood at
onc in the middl of the road though the night wa dark and dismal
yet the form of the unknown might now in some degre be ascertain he
appear to be a horseman of larg dimens and mount on a black
hors of power frame he made no offer of molest or sociabl
but kept aloof on on side of the road jog along on the blind side
of old gunpowd who had now got over hi fright and wayward
ichabod who had no relish for thi strang midnight companion and
bethought himself of the adventur of brom bone with the gallop
hessian now quicken hi steed in hope of leav him behind the
stranger howev quicken hi hors to an equal pace ichabod pull
up and fell into a walk think to lag behindth other did the
same hi heart began to sink within him he endeavor to resum hi
psalm tune but hi parch tongu clove to the roof of hi mouth and
he could not utter a stave there wa someth in the moodi and
dog silenc of thi pertinaci companion that wa mysteri and
appal it wa soon fearfulli account for on mount a rise
ground which brought the figur of hi fellowtravel in relief
against the sky gigant in height and muffl in a cloak ichabod wa
horrorstruck on perceiv that he wa headlessbut hi horror wa
still more increas on observ that the head which should have
rest on hi shoulder wa carri befor him on the pommel of hi
saddl hi terror rose to desper he rain a shower of kick and
blow upon gunpowd hope by a sudden movement to give hi companion
the slip but the spectr start full jump with him awai then thei
dash through thick and thin stone fly and spark flash at
everi bound ichabod flimsi garment flutter in the air as
he stretch hi long lank bodi awai over hi hors head in the
eager of hi flight
thei had now reach the road which turn off to sleepi hollow but
gunpowd who seem possess with a demon instead of keep up it
made an opposit turn and plung headlong downhil to the left thi
road lead through a sandi hollow shade by tree for about a quarter
of a mile where it cross the bridg famou in goblin stori and just
beyond swell the green knoll on which stand the whitewash church
as yet the panic of the steed had given hi unskil rider an appar
advantag in the chase but just as he had got half wai through the
hollow the girth of the saddl gave wai and he felt it slip from
under him he seiz it by the pommel and endeavor to hold it firm
but in vain and had just time to save himself by clasp old gunpowd
round the neck when the saddl fell to the earth and he heard it
trampl under foot by hi pursuer for a moment the terror of han van
ripper wrath pass across hi mindfor it wa hi sundai saddl
but thi wa no time for petti fear the goblin wa hard on hi
haunch and unskil rider that he wa he had much ado to maintain
hi seat sometim slip on on side sometim on anoth and
sometim jolt on the high ridg of hi hors backbon with a
violenc that he verili fear would cleav him asund
an open in the tree now cheer him with the hope that the church
bridg wa at hand the waver reflect of a silver star in the
bosom of the brook told him that he wa not mistaken he saw the wall
of the church dimli glare under the tree beyond he recollect the
place where brom boness ghostli competitor had disappear if i can
but reach that bridg thought ichabod i am safe just then he heard
the black steed pant and blow close behind him he even fanci
that he felt hi hot breath anoth convuls kick in the rib and
old gunpowd sprang upon the bridg he thunder over the resound
plank he gain the opposit side and now ichabod cast a look behind
to see if hi pursuer should vanish accord to rule in a flash of
fire and brimston just then he saw the goblin rise in hi stirrup
and in the veri act of hurl hi head at him ichabod endeavor to
dodg the horribl missil but too late it encount hi cranium
with a tremend crashh wa tumbl headlong into the dust and
gunpowd the black steed and the goblin rider pass by like a
whirlwind
the next morn the old hors wa found without hi saddl and with
the bridl under hi feet soberli crop the grass at hi master
gate ichabod did not make hi appear at breakfast dinnerhour
came but no ichabod the boi assembl at the schoolhous and
stroll idli about the bank of the brook but no schoolmast han
van ripper now began to feel some uneasi about the fate of poor
ichabod and hi saddl an inquiri wa set on foot and after dilig
investig thei came upon hi trace in on part of the road lead
to the church wa found the saddl trampl in the dirt the track of
hors hoof deepli dent in the road and evid at furiou speed
were trace to the bridg beyond which on the bank of a broad part of
the brook where the water ran deep and black wa found the hat of the
unfortun ichabod and close besid it a shatter pumpkin
the brook wa search but the bodi of the schoolmast wa not to
be discov han van ripper as executor of hi estat examin the
bundl which contain all hi worldli effect thei consist of two
shirt and a half two stock for the neck a pair or two of worst
stock an old pair of corduroi smallcloth a rusti razor a book
of psalm tune full of dogsear and a broken pitchpip as to the
book and furnitur of the schoolhous thei belong to the commun
except cotton mather histori of witchcraft a new england
almanac and a book of dream and fortunetel in which last wa
a sheet of foolscap much scribbl and blot in sever fruitless
attempt to make a copi of vers in honor of the heiress of van tassel
these magic book and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consign to the
flame by han van ripper who from that time forward determin to
send hi children no more to school observ that he never knew
ani good come of thi same read and write whatev monei the
schoolmast possess and he had receiv hi quarter pai but a
dai or two befor he must have had about hi person at the time of hi
disappear
the mysteri event caus much specul at the church on the
follow sundai knot of gazer and gossip were collect in the
churchyard at the bridg and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin
had been found the stori of brouwer of bone and a whole budget of
other were call to mind and when thei had dilig consid them
all and compar them with the symptom of the present case thei shook
their head and came to the conclus that ichabod had been carri
off by the gallop hessian as he wa a bachelor and in nobodi
debt nobodi troubl hi head ani more about him the school wa
remov to a differ quarter of the hollow and anoth pedagogu
reign in hi stead
it is true an old farmer who had been down to new york on a visit
sever year after and from whom thi account of the ghostli adventur
wa receiv brought home the intellig that ichabod crane wa still
aliv that he had left the neighborhood partli through fear of the
goblin and han van ripper and partli in mortif at have been
suddenli dismiss by the heiress that he had chang hi quarter to a
distant part of the countri had kept school and studi law at the same
time had been admit to the bar turn politician election
written for the newspap and final had been made a justic of
the ten pound court brom bone too who shortli after hi rival
disappear conduct the bloom katrina in triumph to the altar
wa observ to look exceedingli know whenev the stori of ichabod
wa relat and alwai burst into a hearti laugh at the mention of the
pumpkin which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter
than he chose to tell
the old countri wive howev who ar the best judg of these
matter maintain to thi dai that ichabod wa spirit awai by
supernatur mean and it is a favorit stori often told about the
neighborhood round the winter even fire the bridg becam more than
ever an object of superstiti aw and that mai be the reason why the
road ha been alter of late year so as to approach the church by
the border of the millpond the schoolhous be desert soon fell to
decai and wa report to be haunt by the ghost of the unfortun
pedagogu and the plowboi loiter homeward of a still summer even
ha often fanci hi voic at a distanc chant a melancholi psalm
tune among the tranquil solitud of sleepi hollow
postscript
found in the handwrit of mr knickerbock
the preced tale is given almost in the precis word in which i
heard it relat at a corpor meet at the ancient citi of
manhatto at which were present mani of it sagest and most
illustri burgher the narrat wa a pleasant shabbi gentlemanli
old fellow in pepperandsalt cloth with a sadli humour face
and on whom i strongli suspect of be poorh made such effort
to be entertain when hi stori wa conclud there wa much
laughter and approb particularli from two or three deputi
aldermen who had been asleep the greater part of the time there wa
howev on tall drylook old gentleman with beetl eyebrow
who maintain a grave and rather sever face throughout now and then
fold hi arm inclin hi head and look down upon the floor
as if turn a doubt over in hi mind he wa on of your wari men
who never laugh but upon good groundswhen thei have reason and law on
their side when the mirth of the rest of the compani had subsid and
silenc wa restor he lean on arm on the elbow of hi chair and
stick the other akimbo demand with a slight but exceedingli
sage motion of the head and contract of the brow what wa the
moral of the stori and what it went to prove
the storytel who wa just put a glass of wine to hi lip as
a refresh after hi toil paus for a moment look at hi
inquir with an air of infinit defer and lower the glass
slowli to the tabl observ that the stori wa intend most
logic to prove
that there is no situat in life but ha it advantag and
pleasuresprovid we will but take a joke as we find it
that therefor he that run race with goblin trooper is like to
have rough ride of it
ergo for a countri schoolmast to be refus the hand of a dutch
heiress is a certain step to high prefer in the state
the cautiou old gentleman knit hi brow tenfold closer after thi
explan be sore puzzl by the ratiocin of the
syllog while methought the on in pepperandsalt ei him with
someth of a triumphant leer at length he observ that all thi wa
veri well but still he thought the stori a littl on the
extravagantther were on or two point on which he had hi doubt
faith sir repli the storytel as to that matter i dont
