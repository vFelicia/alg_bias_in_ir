a wonder seren ha taken possess of my entir soul like these
sweet morn of spring which i enjoi with my whole heart i am alon
and feel the charm of exist in thi spot which wa creat for the
bliss of soul like mine i am so happi my dear friend so absorb
in the exquisit sens of mere tranquil exist that i neglect my
talent i should be incap of draw a singl stroke at the present
moment and yet i feel that i never wa a greater artist than now when
while the love vallei teem with vapour around me and the meridian
sun strike the upper surfac of the impenetr foliag of my tree
and but a few strai gleam steal into the inner sanctuari i throw
myself down among the tall grass by the trickl stream and as i lie
close to the earth a thousand unknown plant ar notic by me when
i hear the buzz of the littl world among the stalk and grow familiar
with the countless indescrib form of the insect and fli then i
feel the presenc of the almighti who form us in hi own imag and
the breath of that univers love which bear and sustain us as it
float around us in an etern of bliss and then my friend when
dark overspread my ey and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my
soul and absorb it power like the form of a belov mistress then i
often think with long oh would i could describ these concept
could impress upon paper all that is live so full and warm within me
that it might be the mirror of my soul as my soul is the mirror of the
infinit god o my friendbut it is too much for my strengthi sink
under the weight of the splendour of these vision

i know not whether some deceit spirit haunt thi spot or whether
it be the warm celesti fanci in my own heart which make everyth
around me seem like paradis in front of the hous is a fountaina
fountain to which i am bound by a charm like melusina and her sister
descend a gentl slope you come to an arch where some twenti step
lower down water of the clearest crystal gush from the marbl rock
the narrow wall which enclos it abov the tall tree which encircl
the spot and the cool of the place itselfeveryth impart
a pleasant but sublim impress not a dai pass on which i do not
spend an hour there the young maiden come from the town to fetch
waterinnoc and necessari employ and formerli the occup
of the daughter of king as i take my rest there the idea of the old
patriarch life is awaken around me i see them our old ancestor
how thei form their friendship and contract allianc at the
fountainsid and i feel how fountain and stream were guard by
benefic spirit he who is a stranger to these sensat ha never
realli enjoi cool repos at the side of a fountain after the fatigu
of a weari summer dai

you ask if you shall send me book my dear friend i beseech you
for the love of god reliev me from such a yoke i need no more to be
guid agit heat my heart ferment suffici of itself
i want strain to lull me and i find them to perfect in my homer
often do i strive to allai the burn fever of my blood and you have
never wit anyth so unsteadi so uncertain as my heart but
need i confess thi to you my dear friend who have so often endur
the anguish of wit my sudden transit from sorrow to
immoder joi and from sweet melancholi to violent passion i treat
my poor heart like a sick child and gratifi it everi fanci do not
mention thi again there ar peopl who would censur me for it
mai 15
the common peopl of the place know me alreadi and love me
particularli the children when at first i associ with them and
inquir in a friendli tone about their variou trifl some fanci
that i wish to ridicul them and turn from me in exceed
illhumour i did not allow that circumst to griev me i onli felt
most keenli what i have often befor observ person who can claim
a certain rank keep themselv coldli aloof from the common peopl
as though thei fear to lose their import by the contact whilst
wanton idler and such as ar prone to bad joke affect to descend
to their level onli to make the poor peopl feel their impertin all
the more keenli
i know veri well that we ar not all equal nor can be so but it is my
opinion that he who avoid the common peopl in order not to lose their
respect is as much to blame as a coward who hide himself from hi
enemi becaus he fear defeat
the other dai i went to the fountain and found a young servantgirl
who had set her pitcher on the lowest step and look around to see
if on of her companion wa approach to place it on her head i ran
down and look at her shall i help you pretti lass said i she
blush deepli oh sir she exclaim no ceremoni i repli she
adjust her headgear and i help her she thank me and ascend
the step

what the peopl ar like here i must answer the same as everywher
the human race is but a monoton affair most of them labour the
greater part of their time for mere subsist and the scanti portion
of freedom which remain to them so troubl them that thei us everi

myself and take part in the innoc pleasur which ar not yet
forbidden to the peasantri and enjoi myself for instanc with
genuin freedom and sincer round a wellcov tabl or arrang an

desir them again to give her love to the children and we drove off
the aunt inquir of charlott whether she had finish the book she had
last sent her no said charlott i did not like it you can have
it again and the on befor wa not much better i wa surpris upon
ask the titl to hear that it wa we feel oblig to suppress
the passag in the letter to prevent ani on from feel aggriev
although no author need pai much attent to the opinion of a mere
girl or that of an unsteadi young man
i found penetr and charact in everyth she said everi
express seem to brighten her featur with new charmswith
new rai of geniuswhich unfold by degre as she felt herself
understood
when i wa younger she observ i love noth so much as
romanc noth could equal my delight when on some holidai i could
settl down quietli in a corner and enter with my whole heart and soul
into the joi or sorrow of some fictiti leonora i do not deni that
thei even possess some charm for me yet but i read so seldom that i
prefer book suit exactli to my tast and i like those author best
whose scene describ my own situat in lifeand the friend who ar
about me whose stori touch me with interest from resembl my own
home existencewhich without be absolut paradis is on the
whole a sourc of indescrib happi
i endeavour to conceal the emot which these word occas but
it wa of slight avail for when she had express so truli her opinion
of the vicar of wakefield and of other work the name of which i
omit though the name ar omit yet the author mention deserv
charlott approb and will feel it in their heart when thei read
thi passag it concern no other person i could no longer contain
myself but gave full utter to what i thought of it and it wa not
until charlott had address herself to the two other ladi that
i rememb their presenc and observ them sit mute with
astonish the aunt look at me sever time with an air of
railleri which howev i did not at all mind

said charlott i am readi to confess that i prize it abov all other
amus if anyth disturb me i go to the piano plai an air to
which i have danc and all goe right again directli
you who know me can fanci how steadfastli i gaze upon her rich dark
ey dure these remark how my veri soul gloat over her warm lip
and fresh glow cheek how i becam quit lost in the delight
mean of her word so much so that i scarc heard the actual
express in short i alight from the carriag like a person in a
dream and wa so lost to the dim world around me that i scarc heard
the music which resound from the illumin ballroom
the two messr andran and a certain n n i cannot troubl myself with
the name who were the aunt and charlott partner receiv us
at the carriagedoor and took possess of their ladi whilst i

we commenc with a minuet i led out on ladi after anoth and
precis those who were the most disagre could not bring
themselv to leav off charlott and her partner began an english
countri danc and you must imagin my delight when it wa their turn
to danc the figur with us you should see charlott danc she danc
with her whole heart and soul her figur is all harmoni eleg
and grace as if she were consciou of noth els and had no
other thought or feel and doubtless for the moment everi other
sensat is extinct
she wa engag for the second countri danc but promis me the third
and assur me with the most agreeabl freedom that she wa veri
fond of waltz it is the custom here she said for the previou
partner to waltz togeth but my partner is an indiffer waltzer
and will feel delight if i save him the troubl your partner is not
allow to waltz and inde is equal incap but i observ
dure the countri danc that you waltz well so if you will waltz with
me i beg you would propos it to my partner and i will propos it to
your we agre and it wa arrang that our partner should mutual
entertain each other
we set off and at first delight ourselv with the usual grace
motion of the arm with what grace with what eas she move when
the waltz commenc and the dancer whirl around each other in the
giddi maze there wa some confus ow to the incapac of some of
the dancer we judici remain still allow the other to weari
themselv and when the awkward dancer had withdrawn we join in
and kept it up famous togeth with on other coupleandran and hi
partner never did i danc more lightli i felt myself more than mortal
hold thi loveliest of creatur in my arm fly with her as
rapidli as the wind till i lost sight of everi other object and o
wilhelm i vow at that moment that a maiden whom i love or for whom
i felt the slightest attach never never should waltz with ani on
els but with me if i went to perdit for ityou will understand
thi
we took a few turn in the room to recov our breath charlott sat
down and felt refresh by partak of some orang which i had had
securedth onli on that had been left but at everi slice which
from polit she offer to her neighbour i felt as though a
dagger went through my heart
we were the second coupl in the third countri danc as we were go
down and heaven know with what ecstasi i gaze at her arm and ey
beam with the sweetest feel of pure and genuin enjoy
we pass a ladi whom i had notic for her charm express of
counten although she wa no longer young she look at charlott
with a smile then hold up her finger in a threaten attitud
repeat twice in a veri signific tone of voic the name of albert
who is albert said i to charlott if it is not impertin to ask
she wa about to answer when we were oblig to separ in order to
execut a figur in the danc and as we cross over again in front of
each other i perceiv she look somewhat pensiv why need i conceal
it from you she said as she gave me her hand for the promenad
albert is a worthi man to whom i am engag now there wa noth
new to me in thi for the girl had told me of it on the wai but it
wa so far new that i had not thought of it in connect with her whom
in so short a time i had learn to prize so highli enough i becam
confus got out in the figur and occas gener confus so
that it requir all charlott presenc of mind to set me right by
pull and push me into my proper place
the danc wa not yet finish when the lightn which had for some
time been seen in the horizon and which i had assert to proce
entir from heat grew more violent and the thunder wa heard abov
the music when ani distress or terror surpris us in the midst of our
amus it natur make a deeper impress than at other time
either becaus the contrast make us more keenli suscept or rather
perhap becaus our sens ar then more open to impress and the
shock is consequ stronger to thi caus i must ascrib the fright
and shriek of the ladi on sagaci sat down in a corner with
her back to the window and held her finger to her ear a second knelt
down befor her and hid her face in her lap a third threw herself
between them and embrac her sister with a thousand tear some
insist on go home other unconsci of their action want
suffici presenc of mind to repress the impertin of their young
partner who sought to direct to themselv those sigh which the lip
of our agit beauti intend for heaven some of the gentlemen had
gone downstair to smoke a quiet cigar and the rest of the compani
gladli embrac a happi suggest of the hostess to retir into anoth
room which wa provid with shutter and curtain we had hardli got
there when charlott place the chair in a circl and when the
compani had sat down in complianc with her request she forthwith
propos a round game
i notic some of the compani prepar their mouth and draw themselv
up at the prospect of some agreeabl forfeit let us plai at count
said charlott now pai attent i shall go round the circl from
right to left and each person is to count on after the other the
number that come to him and must count fast whoever stop or
mistak is to have a box on the ear and so on till we have count a
thousand it wa delight to see the fun she went round the circl
with uprais arm on said the first two the second three
the third and so on till charlott went faster and faster on made a
mistak instantli a box on the ear and amid the laughter that ensu
came anoth box and so on faster and faster i myself came in for
two i fanci thei were harder than the rest and felt quit delight
a gener laughter and confus put an end to the game long befor
we had count as far as a thousand the parti broke up into littl
separ knot the storm had ceas and i follow charlott into the
ballroom on the wai she said the game banish their fear of the
storm i could make no repli i myself she continu wa as much
frighten as ani of them but by affect courag to keep up the
spirit of the other i forgot my apprehens we went to the
window it wa still thunder at a distanc a soft rain wa pour
down over the countri and fill the air around us with delici
odour charlott lean forward on her arm her ey wander over the
scene she rais them to the sky and then turn them upon me
thei were moisten with tear she place her hand on mine and said
klopstock at onc i rememb the magnific od which wa in her
thought i felt oppress with the weight of my sensat and sank
under them it wa more than i could bear i bent over her hand kiss
it in a stream of delici tear and again look up to her ey
divin klopstock why didst thou not see thy apotheosi in those ey

excurs that all heaven lai so near it how often in my wander
from the hillsid or from the meadow across the river have i beheld
thi huntinglodg which now contain within it all the joi of my

i have often my dear wilhelm reflect on the eager men feel to
wander and make new discoveri and upon that secret impuls which
afterward inclin them to return to their narrow circl conform to
the law of custom and embarrass themselv no longer with what pass
around them
it is so strang how when i came here first and gaze upon that
love vallei from the hillsid i felt charm with the entir scene
surround me the littl wood oppositehow delight to sit under
it shade how fine the view from that point of rock then that
delight chain of hill and the exquisit vallei at their feet
could i but wander and lose myself amongst them i went and return
without find what i wish distanc my friend is like futur a
dim vast is spread befor our soul the percept of our mind ar
as obscur as those of our vision and we desir earnestli to surrend
up our whole be that it mai be fill with the complet and perfect

we ar as poor and circumscrib as ever and our soul still languish
for unattain happi

own cottag in the arm of hi wife in the affect of hi children
and in the labour necessari for their support that happi which he
had sought in vain through the wide world
when in the morn at sunris i go out to walheim and with my own
hand gather in the garden the peas which ar to serv for my dinner
when i sit down to shell them and read my homer dure the interv
and then select a saucepan from the kitchen fetch my own butter

capabl of feel the same simpl and innoc pleasur as the peasant
whose tabl is cover with food of hi own rear and who not onli

the consol charlott can bring to an invalid i experi from my
own heart which suffer more from her absenc than mani a poor creatur
linger on a bed of sick she is gone to spend a few dai in the
town with a veri worthi woman who is given over by the physician and
wish to have charlott near her in her last moment i accompani
her last week on a visit to the vicar of s a small villag in
the mountain about a leagu henc we arriv about four oclock
charlott had taken her littl sister with her when we enter the
vicarag court we found the good old man sit on a bench befor
the door under the shade of two larg walnuttre at the sight
of charlott he seem to gain new life rose forgot hi stick and
ventur to walk toward her she ran to him and made him sit down
again then place herself by hi side she gave him a number of
messag from her father and then caught up hi youngest child a
dirti ugli littl thing the joi of hi old ag and kiss it i wish

ensu summer there and assur him that he look better and stronger
than he did when she saw him last i in the meantim paid attent to
hi good ladi the old man seem quit in spirit and as i could
not help admir the beauti of the walnuttre which form such
an agreeabl shade over our head he began though with some littl
difficulti to tell us their histori as to the oldest said he we
do not know who plant itsom sai on clergyman and some anoth
but the younger on there behind us is exactli the ag of my wife
fifti year old next octob her father plant it in the morn
and in the even she came into the world my wife father wa my
predecessor here and i cannot tell you how fond he wa of that tree
and it is fulli as dear to me under the shade of that veri tree upon
a log of wood my wife wa seat knit when i a poor student came
into thi court for the first time just seven and twenti year ago
charlott inquir for hi daughter he said she wa gone with herr
schmidt to the meadow and wa with the haymak the old man then
resum hi stori and told us how hi predecessor had taken a fanci
to him as had hi daughter likewis and how he had becom first hi

livelylook goodhumour brunett quit compet to amus on for
a short time in the countri her lover for such herr schmidt evid
appear to be wa a polit reserv personag and would not join
our convers notwithstand all charlott endeavour to draw
him out i wa much annoi at observ by hi counten that
hi silenc did not aris from want of talent but from capric and
illhumour thi subsequ becam veri evid when we set out to
take a walk and frederica join charlott with whom i wa talk
the worthi gentleman face which wa natur rather sombr becam
so dark and angri that charlott wa oblig to touch my arm and remind
me that i wa talk too much to frederica noth distress me more
than to see men torment each other particularli when in the flower of
their ag in the veri season of pleasur thei wast their few short
dai of sunshin in quarrel and disput and onli perceiv their error
when it is too late to repair it thi thought dwelt upon my mind and
in the even when we return to the vicar and were sit round
the tabl with our bread end milk the convers turn on the joi
and sorrow of the world i could not resist the temptat to inveigh
bitterli against illhumour we ar apt said i to complain
butwith veri littl caus that our happi dai ar few and our evil
dai mani if our heart were alwai dispos to receiv the benefit
heaven send us we should acquir strength to support evil when it
come but observ the vicar wife we cannot alwai command our
temper so much depend upon the constitut when the bodi suffer
the mind is ill at eas i acknowledg that i continu but we
must consid such a disposit in the light of a diseas and inquir
whether there is no remedi for it
i should be glad to hear on said charlott at least i think veri
much depend upon ourselv i know it is so with me when anyth
annoi me and disturb my temper i hasten into the garden hum a
coupl of countri danc and it is all right with me directli that
is what i meant i repli illhumour resembl indol it is
natur to us but if onc we have courag to exert ourselv we find
our work run fresh from our hand and we experi in the activ
from which we shrank a real enjoy frederica listen veri
attent and the young man object that we were not master of
ourselv and still less so of our feel the question is about a
disagre feel i ad from which everi on would willingli
escap but none know their own power without trial invalid ar glad
to consult physician and submit to the most scrupul regimen the
most nauseou medicin in order to recov their health i observ
that the good old man inclin hi head and exert himself to hear our
discours so i rais my voic and address myself directli to
him we preach against a great mani crime i observ but i never
rememb a sermon deliv against illhumour that mai do veri
well for your town clergymen said he countri peopl ar never
illhumour though inde it might be us occasion to my
wife for instanc and the judg we all laugh as did he likewis
veri cordial till he fell into a fit of cough which interrupt
our convers for a time herr schmidt resum the subject you
call ill humour a crime he remark but i think you us too strong
a term not at all i repli if that deserv the name which is
so pernici to ourselv and our neighbour is it not enough that we
want the power to make on anoth happi must we depriv each other of
the pleasur which we can all make for ourselv show me the man who
ha the courag to hide hi illhumour who bear the whole burden
himself without disturb the peac of those around him no
illhumour aris from an inward conscious of our own want of merit
from a discont which ever accompani that envi which foolish vaniti
engend we see peopl happi whom we have not made so and cannot
endur the sight charlott look at me with a smile she observ
the emot with which i spoke and a tear in the ey of frederica
stimul me to proce woe unto those i said who us their power
over a human heart to destroi the simpl pleasur it would natur
enjoi all the favour all the attent in the world cannot
compens for the loss of that happi which a cruel tyranni ha
destroi my heart wa full as i spoke a recollect of mani thing
which had happen press upon my mind and fill my ey with tear
we should daili repeat to ourselv i exclaim that we should not
interfer with our friend unless to leav them in possess of their
own joi and increas their happi by share it with them but when
their soul ar torment by a violent passion or their heart
rent with grief is it in your power to afford them the slightest
consol
and when the last fatal maladi seiz the be whose untim grave
you have prepar when she li languid and exhaust befor you her
dim ey rais to heaven and the damp of death upon her pallid brow
there you stand at her bedsid like a condemn crimin with the
bitter feel that your whole fortun could not save her and the
agonis thought wring you that all your effort ar powerless to
impart even a moment strength to the depart soul or quicken her
with a transitori consol
at these word the remembr of a similar scene at which i had been
onc present fell with full forc upon my heart i buri my face in my
handkerchief and hasten from the room and wa onli recal to my
recollect by charlott voic who remind me that it wa time to
return home with what tender she chid me on the wai for the too
eager interest i took in everyth she declar it would do me injuri
and that i ought to spare myself ye my angel i will do so for your
sake

albert is arriv and i must take my departur were he the best and
noblest of men and i in everi respect hi inferior i could not endur
to see him in possess of such a perfect be possessionenough
wilhelm her betroth is herea fine worthi fellow whom on cannot
help like fortun i wa not present at their meet it would
have broken my heart and he is so consider he ha not given
charlott on kiss in my presenc heaven reward him for it i must love
him for the respect with which he treat her he show a regard for me
but for thi i suspect i am more indebt to charlott than to hi own
fanci for me women have a delic tact in such matter and it should
be so thei cannot alwai succe in keep two rival on term with
each other but when thei do thei ar the onli gainer
i cannot help esteem albert the cool of hi temper contrast
strongli with the impetuos of mine which i cannot conceal he ha
a great deal of feel and is fulli sensibl of the treasur he
possess in charlott he is free from illhumour which you know is
the fault i detest most
he regard me as a man of sens and my attach to charlott and the
interest i take in all that concern her augment hi triumph and hi
love i shall not inquir whether he mai not at time teas her with
some littl jealousi as i know that were i in hi place i should
not be entir free from such sensat
but be that as it mai my pleasur with charlott is over call it
folli or infatu what signifi a name the thing speak for
itself befor albert came i knew all that i know now i knew i could
make no pretens to her nor did i offer ani that is as far as it
wa possibl in the presenc of so much loveli not to pant for
it enjoy and now behold me like a silli fellow stare with
astonish when anoth come in and depriv me of my love
i bite my lip and feel infinit scorn for those who tell me to be
resign becaus there is no help for it let me escap from the yoke
of such silli subterfug i rambl through the wood and when i return
to charlott and find albert sit by her side in the summerhous
in the garden i am unabl to bear it behav like a fool and commit a
thousand extravag for heaven sake said charlott todai let
us have no more scene like those of last night you terrifi me when you
ar so violent between ourselv i am alwai awai now when he visit
her and i feel delight when i find her alon
august 8
believ me dear wilhelm i did not allud to you when i spoke so
sever of those who advis resign to inevit fate i did not
think it possibl for you to indulg such a sentiment but in fact you
ar right i onli suggest on object in thi world on is seldom
reduc to make a select between two altern there ar as mani
varieti of conduct and opinion as there ar turn of featur between
an aquilin nose and a flat on
you will therefor permit me to conced your entir argument and yet
contriv mean to escap your dilemma
your posit is thi i hear you sai either you have hope of
obtain charlott or you have none well in the first case pursu
your cours and press on to the fulfil of your wish in the
second be a man and shake off a miser passion which will enerv
and destroi you my dear friend thi is well and easili said
but would you requir a wretch be whose life is slowli wast
under a linger diseas to despatch himself at onc by the stroke of
a dagger doe not the veri disord which consum hi strength depriv
him of the courag to effect hi deliver
you mai answer me if you pleas with a similar analog who would
not prefer the amput of an arm to the peril of life by doubt and
procrastin but i know not if i am right and let us leav these
comparison
enough there ar moment wilhelm when i could rise up and shake it
all off and when if i onli knew where to go i could fly from thi
place
the same even
my diari which i have for some time neglect came befor me todai
and i am amaz to see how deliber i have entangl myself step by
step to have seen my posit so clearli and yet to have act so like
a child even still i behold the result plainli and yet have no thought
of act with greater prudenc
august 10
if i were not a fool i could spend the happiest and most delight
life here so mani agreeabl circumst and of a kind to ensur
a worthi man happi ar seldom unit ala i feel it too
sensiblyth heart alon make our happi to be admit into
thi most charm famili to be love by the father as a son by the
children as a father and by charlott then the nobl albert who never
disturb my happi by ani appear of illhumour receiv me with
the heartiest affect and love me next to charlott better
than all the world wilhelm you would be delight to hear us in our
rambl and convers about charlott noth in the world can be
more absurd than our connect and yet the thought of it often move
me to tear
he tell me sometim of her excel mother how upon her deathb
she had commit her hous and children to charlott and had given
charlott herself in charg to him how sinc that time a new spirit
had taken possess of her how in care and anxieti for their welfar
she becam a real mother to them how everi moment of her time wa
devot to some labour of love in their behalfand yet her mirth and
cheer had never forsaken her i walk by hi side pluck flower
by the wai arrang them carefulli into a nosegai then fling them into
the first stream i pass and watch them as thei float gentli awai i
forget whether i told you that albert is to remain here he ha receiv
a govern appoint with a veri good salari and i understand
he is in high favour at court i have met few person so punctual and
method in busi
august 12
certainli albert is the best fellow in the world i had a strang scene
with him yesterdai i went to take leav of him for i took it into my
head to spend a few dai in these mountain from where i now write
to you as i wa walk up and down hi room my ey fell upon hi
pistol lend me those pistol said i for my journei by all
mean he repli if you will take the troubl to load them for thei
onli hang there for form i took down on of them and he continu
ever sinc i wa near suffer for my extrem caution i will have
noth to do with such thing i wa curiou to hear the stori i wa
stai said he some three month ago at a friend hous in the
countri i had a brace of pistol with me unload and i slept without
ani anxieti on raini afternoon i wa sit by myself do noth
when it occur to me i do not know how that the hous might be
attack that we might requir the pistol that we might in short you
know how we go on fanci when we have noth better to do i gave
the pistol to the servant to clean and load he wa plai with the
maid and try to frighten her when the pistol went offgod know
howth ramrod wa in the barrel and it went straight through
her right hand and shatter the thumb i had to endur all the
lament and to pai the surgeon bill so sinc that time i have
kept all my weapon unload but my dear friend what is the us of
prudenc we can never be on our guard against all possibl danger
howevernow you must know i can toler all men till thei come to
howeverfor it is selfevid that everi univers rule must have
it except but he is so exceedingli accur that if he onli
fanci he ha said a word too precipit or too gener or onli half
true he never ceas to qualifi to modifi and extenu till at last
he appear to have said noth at all upon thi occas albert wa
deepli immers in hi subject i ceas to listen to him and becam
lost in reveri with a sudden motion i point the mouth of the pistol
to my forehead over the right ey what do you mean cri albert
turn back the pistol it is not load said i and even if not
he answer with impati what can you mean i cannot comprehend how
a man can be so mad as to shoot himself and the bare idea of it shock
me
but why should ani on said i in speak of an action ventur
to pronounc it mad or wise or good or bad what is the mean of all
thi have you carefulli studi the secret motiv of our action do
you understandcan you explain the caus which occas them and make
them inevit if you can you will be less hasti with your decis
but you will allow said albert that some action ar crimin let
them spring from whatev motiv thei mai i grant it and shrug
my shoulder
but still my good friend i continu there ar some except
here too theft is a crime but the man who commit it from extrem
poverti with no design but to save hi famili from perish is he an
object of piti or of punish who shall throw the first stone at a
husband who in the heat of just resent sacrific hi faithless
wife and her perfidi seduc or at the young maiden who in her
weak hour of raptur forget herself in the impetu joi of love
even our law cold and cruel as thei ar relent in such case and
withhold their punish
that is quit anoth thing said albert becaus a man under the
influenc of violent passion lose all power of reflect and is
regard as intox or insan
oh you peopl of sound understand i repli smile ar ever
readi to exclaim extravag and mad and intox you
moral men ar so calm and so subdu you abhor the drunken man and
detest the extravag you pass by like the levit and thank god
like the pharise that you ar not like on of them i have been more
than onc intox my passion have alwai border on extravag
i am not asham to confess it for i have learn by my own
experi that all extraordinari men who have accomplish great and
astonish action have ever been decri by the world as drunken or
insan and in privat life too is it not intoler that no on can
undertak the execut of a nobl or gener deed without give rise
to the exclam that the doer is intox or mad shame upon you
ye sage
thi is anoth of your extravag humour said albert you alwai
exagger a case and in thi matter you ar undoubtedli wrong for we
were speak of suicid which you compar with great action when it
is imposs to regard it as anyth but a weak it is much easier
to die than to bear a life of miseri with fortitud
i wa on the point of break off the convers for noth put me
so complet out of patienc as the utter of a wretch commonplac
when i am talk from my inmost heart howev i compos myself for
i had often heard the same observ with suffici vexat and
i answer him therefor with a littl warmth you call thi a
weaknessbewar of be led astrai by appear when a nation
which ha long groan under the intoler yoke of a tyrant rise at
last and throw off it chain do you call that weak the man
who to rescu hi hous from the flame find hi physic strength
redoubl so that he lift burden with eas which in the absenc of
excit he could scarc move he who under the rage of an insult
attack and put to flight half a score of hi enemi ar such person
to be call weak my good friend if resist be strength how can
the highest degre of resist be a weak
albert look steadfastli at me and said prai forgiv me but i do
not see that the exampl you have adduc bear ani relat to the
question veri like i answer for i have often been told that
my style of illustr border a littl on the absurd but let us see
if we cannot place the matter in anoth point of view by inquir
what can be a man state of mind who resolv to free himself from
the burden of lifea burden often so pleasant to bearfor we cannot
otherwis reason fairli upon the subject
human natur i continu ha it limit it is abl to endur a
certain degre of joi sorrow and pain but becom annihil as soon
as thi measur is exceed the question therefor is not whether a
man is strong or weak but whether he is abl to endur the measur
of hi suffer the suffer mai be moral or physic and in
my opinion it is just as absurd to call a man a coward who destroi
himself as to call a man a coward who di of a malign fever
paradox all paradox exclaim albert not so paradox as you
imagin i repli you allow that we design a diseas as mortal
when natur is so sever attack and her strength so far exhaust
that she cannot possibl recov her former condit under ani chang
that mai take place
now my good friend appli thi to the mind observ a man in
hi natur isol condit consid how idea work and how
impress fasten on him till at length a violent passion seiz him
destroi all hi power of calm reflect and utterli ruin him
it is in vain that a man of sound mind and cool temper understand the
condit of such a wretch be in vain he counsel him he can no
more commun hi own wisdom to him than a healthi man can instil hi
strength into the invalid by whose bedsid he is seat
albert thought thi too gener i remind him of a girl who had
drown herself a short time previous and i relat her histori
she wa a good creatur who had grown up in the narrow sphere of
household industri and weekli appoint labour on who knew no pleasur
beyond indulg in a walk on sundai arrai in her best attir
accompani by her friend or perhap join in the danc now and then
at some festiv and chat awai her spare hour with a neighbour
discuss the scandal or the quarrel of the villag trifl
suffici to occupi her heart at length the warmth of her natur is
influenc by certain new and unknown wish inflam by the flatteri
of men her former pleasur becom by degre insipid till at length
she meet with a youth to whom she is attract by an indescrib
feel upon him she now rest all her hope she forget the world
around her she see hear desir noth but him and him onli he
alon occupi all her thought uncorrupt by the idl indulg of
an enerv vaniti her affect move steadili toward it object
she hope to becom hi and to realis in an everlast union with
him all that happi which she sought all that bliss for which
she long hi repeat promis confirm her hope embrac and
endear which increas the ardour of her desir overmast her
soul she float in a dim delus anticip of her happi and
her feel becom excit to their utmost tension she stretch out
her arm final to embrac the object of all her wish and her lover
forsak her stun and bewild she stand upon a precipic all
is dark around her no prospect no hope no consolationforsaken
by him in whom her exist wa centr she see noth of the wide
world befor her think noth of the mani individu who might
suppli the void in her heart she feel herself desert forsaken by
the world and blind and impel by the agoni which wring her soul
she plung into the deep to end her suffer in the broad embrac of
death see here albert the histori of thousand and tell me is not
thi a case of physic infirm natur ha no wai to escap from the
labyrinth her power ar exhaust she can contend no longer and the
poor soul must die
shame upon him who can look on calmli and exclaim the foolish girl
she should have wait she should have allow time to wear off the
impress her despair would have been soften and she would have
found anoth lover to comfort her on might as well sai the fool
to die of a fever why did he not wait till hi strength wa restor
till hi blood becam calm all would then have gone well and he would
have been aliv now
albert who could not see the justic of the comparison offer some
further object and amongst other urg that i had taken the
case of a mere ignor girl but how ani man of sens of more enlarg
view and experi could be excus he wa unabl to comprehend my
friend i exclaim man is but man and whatev be the extent
of hi reason power thei ar of littl avail when passion rage
within and he feel himself confin by the narrow limit of natur
it were better thenbut we will talk of thi some other time i said
and caught up my hat ala my heart wa full and we part without
convict on either side how rare in thi world do men understand
each other
august 15
there can be no doubt that in thi world noth is so indispens as
love i observ that charlott could not lose me without a pang and the
veri children have but on wish that is that i should visit them again
tomorrow i went thi afternoon to tune charlott piano but i could
not do it for the littl on insist on my tell them a stori and
charlott herself urg me to satisfi them i wait upon them at tea
and thei ar now as fulli content with me as with charlott and
i told them my veri best tale of the princess who wa wait upon by
dwarf i improv myself by thi exercis and am quit surpris at the
impress my stori creat if i sometim invent an incid which i
forget upon the next narrat thei remind on directli that the stori
wa differ befor so that i now endeavour to relat with exact
the same anecdot in the same monoton tone which never chang i
find by thi how much an author injur hi work by alter them
even though thei be improv in a poetic point of view the first
impress is readili receiv we ar so constitut that we believ
the most incred thing and onc thei ar engrav upon the memori
woe to him who would endeavour to effac them
august 18
must it ever be thusthat the sourc of our happi must also be the
fountain of our miseri the full and ardent sentiment which anim
my heart with the love of natur overwhelm me with a torrent of
delight and which brought all paradis befor me ha now becom an
insupport torment a demon which perpetu pursu and harass
me when in bygon dai i gaze from these rock upon yonder mountain
across the river and upon the green floweri vallei befor me and saw
all natur bud and burst around the hill cloth from foot
to peak with tall thick forest tree the vallei in all their vari
wind shade with the loveliest wood and the soft river glide
along amongst the lisp reed mirror the beauti cloud which
the soft even breez waft across the skywhen i heard the grove
about me melodi with the music of bird and saw the million swarm
of insect danc in the last golden beam of the sun whose set
rai awok the hum beetl from their grassi bed whilst the
subdu tumult around direct my attent to the ground and i there
observ the arid rock compel to yield nutriment to the dry moss
whilst the heath flourish upon the barren sand below me all thi
displai to me the inner warmth which anim all natur and fill
and glow within my heart i felt myself exalt by thi overflow
ful to the percept of the godhead and the gloriou form of
an infinit univers becam visibl to my soul stupend mountain
encompass me abyss yawn at my feet and cataract fell headlong
down befor me impetu river roll through the plain and rock
and mountain resound from afar in the depth of the earth i saw
innumer power in motion and multipli to infin whilst
upon it surfac and beneath the heaven there teem ten thousand
varieti of live creatur everyth around is aliv with an
infinit number of form while mankind fly for secur to their petti
hous from the shelter of which thei rule in their imagin over

thing ar littl from the inaccess mountain across the desert
which no mortal foot ha trod far as the confin of the unknown ocean
breath the spirit of the etern creator and everi atom to which he
ha given exist find favour in hi sight ah how often at that
time ha the flight of a bird soar abov my head inspir me
with the desir of be transport to the shore of the immeasur
water there to quaff the pleasur of life from the foam goblet
of the infinit and to partak if but for a moment even with
the confin power of my soul the beatitud of that creator who
accomplish all thing in himself and through himself
my dear friend the bare recollect of those hour still consol me
even thi effort to recal those ineff sensat and give them
utter exalt my soul abov itself and make me doubli feel the
intens of my present anguish
it is as if a curtain had been drawn from befor my ey and instead
of prospect of etern life the abyss of an ever open grave yawn
befor me can we sai of anyth that it exist when all pass awai
when time with the speed of a storm carri all thing onwardand
our transitori exist hurri along by the torrent is either
swallow up by the wave or dash against the rock there is not a

august 21
in vain do i stretch out my arm toward her when i awaken in the morn
from my weari slumber in vain do i seek for her at night in my bed
when some innoc dream ha happili deceiv me and place her near me
in the field when i have seiz her hand and cover it with countless
kiss and when i feel for her in the half confus of sleep with the
happi sens that she is near tear flow from my oppress heart and
bereft of all comfort i weep over my futur woe

albert upon open it i found on of the pink ribbon which charlott
wore in her dress the first time i saw her and which i had sever

of wetstein homer a book i had often wish for to save me the
inconveni of carri the larg ernestin edit with me upon my
walk you see how thei anticip my wish how well thei understand
all those littl attent of friendship so superior to the costli
present of the great which ar humili i kiss the ribbon a
thousand time and in everi breath inhal the remembr of those

wilhelm is our fate i do not murmur at it the flower of life ar but
visionari how mani pass awai and leav no trace behindhow few yield

suffer the littl that doe realli ripen to rot decai and perish
unenjoi farewel thi is a gloriou summer i often climb into the
tree in charlott orchard and shake down the pear that hang on the
highest branch she stand below and catch them as thei fall

trackless thicket where i am lacer and torn by thorn and brier
and thenc i find relief sometim i lie stretch on the ground

the last time i am free i have had the courag in an interview of
two hour durat not to betrai my intent and o wilhelm what a
convers it wa
albert had promis to come to charlott in the garden immedi
after supper i wa upon the terrac under the tall chestnut tree and
watch the set sun i saw him sink for the last time beneath thi
delight vallei and silent stream i had often visit the same
spot with charlott and wit that gloriou sight and nowi wa
walk up and down the veri avenu which wa so dear to me a secret
sympathi had frequent drawn me thither befor i knew charlott and
we were delight when in our earli acquaint we discov that we
each love the same spot which is inde as romant as ani that ever
captiv the fanci of an artist
from beneath the chestnut tree there is an extens view but i
rememb that i have mention all thi in a former letter and have
describ the tall mass of beech tree at the end and how the avenu
grow darker and darker as it wind it wai among them till it end
in a gloomi recess which ha all the charm of a mysteri solitud i
still rememb the strang feel of melancholi which came over me the
first time i enter that dark retreat at bright middai i felt some
secret forebod that it would on dai be to me the scene of some
happi or miseri
i had spent half an hour struggl between the contend thought of

forward and sat down again i wa restless and miser charlott
drew our attent to the beauti effect of the moonlight which threw
a silver hue over the terrac in front of us beyond the beech tree

which surround the spot where we were we remain for some time
silent when charlott observ whenev i walk by moonlight it

we arriv here yesterdai the ambassador is indispos and will not
go out for some dai if he were less peevish and moros all would
be well i see but too plainli that heaven ha destin me to sever
trial but courag a light heart mai bear anyth a light heart
i smile to find such a word proceed from my pen a littl more
lighthearted would render me the happiest be under the sun
but must i despair of my talent and faculti whilst other of far
inferior abil parad befor me with the utmost selfsatisfact
graciou provid to whom i ow all my power why didst thou not
withhold some of those bless i possess and substitut in their
place a feel of selfconfid and content
but patienc all will yet be well for i assur you my dear friend
you were right sinc i have been oblig to associ continu with
other peopl and observ what thei do and how thei emploi themselv
i have becom far better satisfi with myself for we ar so
constitut by natur that we ar ever prone to compar ourselv with
other and our happi or miseri depend veri much on the object
and person around us on thi account noth is more danger than
solitud there our imagin alwai dispos to rise take a new
flight on the wing of fanci pictur to us a chain of be of whom
we seem the most inferior all thing appear greater than thei realli
ar and all seem superior to us thi oper of the mind is quit
natur we so continu feel our own imperfect and fanci we
perceiv in other the qualiti we do not possess attribut to them
also all that we enjoi ourselv that by thi process we form the idea
of a perfect happi mana man howev who onli exist in our own
imagin
but when in spite of weak and disappoint we set to work in
earnest and persever steadili we often find that though oblig
continu to tack we make more wai than other who have the
assist of wind and tide and in truth there can be no greater
satisfact than to keep pace with other or outstrip them in the race

i begin to find my situat here more toler consid all

entertain for me i have form the acquaint of the count
cand i esteem him more and more everi dai he is a man of strong
understand and great discern but though he see farther than
other peopl he is not on that account cold in hi manner but capabl
of inspir and return the warmest affect he appear interest
in me on on occas when i had to transact some busi with him he
perceiv at the first word that we understood each other and that
he could convers with me in a differ tone from what he us with
other i cannot suffici esteem hi frank and open kind to me
it is the greatest and most genuin of pleasur to observ a great mind
in sympathi with our own

will do but recommend me to look over them again as on mai
alwai improv by us a better word or a more appropri particl

conjunct not an adverb must be omit he ha a deadli antipathi
to all those transposit of which i am so fond and if the music
of our period is not tune to the establish offici kei he cannot
comprehend our mean it is deplor to be connect with such a
fellow
my acquaint with the count ci the onli compens for such an
evil he told me frankli the other dai that he wa much displeas
with the difficulti and delai of the ambassador that peopl like him
ar obstacl both to themselv and to other but ad he on
must submit like a travel who ha to ascend a mountain if the
mountain wa not there the road would be both shorter and pleasant
but there it is and he must get over it
the old man perceiv the count partial for me thi annoi him
and he seiz everi opportun to depreci the count in my hear
i natur defend him and that onli make matter wors yesterdai he
made me indign for he also allud to me the count he said is
a man of the world and a good man of busi hi style is good
and he write with facil but like other genius he ha no solid
learn he look at me with an express that seem to ask if i
felt the blow but it did not produc the desir effect i despis a
man who can think and act in such a manner howev i made a stand and
answer with not a littl warmth the count i said wa a man entitl
to respect alik for hi charact and hi acquir i had never
met a person whose mind wa store with more us and extens
knowledgewho had in fact master such an infinit varieti of

took my leav lest my anger should be too highli excit by some new
absurd of hi

neck to thi yoke by preach a life of activ to me if the man who
plant veget and carri hi corn to town on marketdai is not

in such constant agit that i am well content to let other pursu
their own cours if thei onli allow me the same privileg
what provok me most is the unhappi extent to which distinct of

though in doubt and seem desir of return but would nevertheless
proce and engag in such thought and soliloqui as we have
describ he final reach the huntinglodg with a sort of
involuntari consent
upon on occas he enter the hous and inquir for charlott
he observ that the inmat were in a state of unusu confus
the eldest boi inform him that a dread misfortun had occur
at walheimthat a peasant had been murder but thi made littl
impress upon him enter the apart he found charlott engag
reason with her father who in spite of hi infirm insist on
go to the scene of the crime in order to institut an inquiri the
crimin wa unknown the victim had been found dead at hi own door
that morn suspicion were excit the murder man had been in
the servic of a widow and the person who had previous fill the
situat had been dismiss from her employ
as soon as werther heard thi he exclaim with great excit
is it possibl i must go to the spoti cannot delai a moment he
hasten to walheim everi incid return vividli to hi remembr
and he entertain not the slightest doubt that that man wa the
murder to whom he had so often spoken and for whom he entertain
so much regard hi wai took him past the wellknown lime tree to the
hous where the bodi had been carri and hi feel were greatli
excit at the sight of the fondli recollect spot that threshold
where the neighbour children had so often plai togeth wa stain
with blood love and attach the noblest feel of human natur
had been convert into violenc and murder the huge tree stood there
leafless and cover with hoarfrost the beauti hedgerow which
surround the old churchyard wall were wither and the graveston
half cover with snow were visibl through the open
as he approach the inn in front of which the whole villag wa
assembl scream were suddenli heard a troop of arm peasant wa
seen approach and everi on exclaim that the crimin had been
apprehend werther look and wa not long in doubt the prison
wa no other than the servant who had been formerli so attach to the
widow and whom he had met prowl about with that suppress anger
and illconc despair which we have befor describ
what have you done unfortun man inquir werther as he advanc
toward the prison the latter turn hi ey upon him in silenc and
then repli with perfect composur no on will now marri her and
she will marri no on the prison wa taken into the inn and werther
left the place the mind of werther wa fearfulli excit by thi
shock occurr he ceas howev to be oppress by hi usual
feel of melancholi moros and indiffer to everyth
that pass around him he entertain a strong degre of piti for the
prison and wa seiz with an indescrib anxieti to save him from
hi impend fate he consid him so unfortun he deem hi
crime so excus and thought hi own condit so nearli similar
that he felt convinc he could make everi on els view the matter in
the light in which he saw it himself he now becam anxiou to undertak
hi defenc and commenc compos an eloqu speech for the
occas and on hi wai to the huntinglodg he could not refrain
from speak aloud the statement which he resolv to make to the
judg
upon hi arriv he found albert had been befor him and he wa a
littl perplex by thi meet but he soon recov himself and
express hi opinion with much warmth to the judg the latter shook
hi head doubtingli and although werther urg hi case with the utmost
zeal feel and determin in defenc of hi client yet as we
mai easili suppos the judg wa not much influenc by hi appeal
on the contrari he interrupt him in hi address reason with
him serious and even administ a rebuk to him for becom
the advoc of a murder he demonstr that accord to thi
preced everi law might be violat and the public secur utterli
destroi he ad moreov that in such a case he could himself do
noth without incur the greatest respons that everyth
must follow in the usual cours and pursu the ordinari channel
werther howev did not abandon hi enterpris and even besought the
judg to conniv at the flight of the prison but thi propos
wa peremptorili reject albert who had taken some part in the
discuss coincid in opinion with the judg at thi werther becam
enrag and took hi leav in great anger after the judg had more
than onc assur him that the prison could not be save
the excess of hi grief at thi assur mai be infer from a note we
have found amongst hi paper and which wa doubtless written upon thi
veri occas
you cannot be save unfortun man i see clearli that we cannot be
save
werther wa highli incens at the observ which albert had made
to the judg in thi matter of the prison he thought he could detect
therein a littl bitter toward himself person and although
upon reflect it could not escap hi sound judgment that their view
of the matter wa correct he felt the greatest possibl reluct to
make such an admiss
a memorandum of werther upon thi point express of hi gener
feel toward albert ha been found amongst hi paper
what is the us of my continu repeat that he is a good and
estim man he is an inward torment to me and i am incap of
be just toward him
on fine even in winter when the weather seem inclin to thaw
charlott and albert were return home togeth the former look
from time to time about her as if she miss werther compani albert
began to speak of him and censur him for hi prejudic he
allud to hi unfortun attach and wish it were possibl
to discontinu hi acquaint i desir it on our own account he
ad and i request you will compel him to alter hi deport toward
you and to visit you less frequent the world is censori and i
know that here and there we ar spoken of charlott made no repli
and albert seem to feel her silenc at least from that time he never
again spoke of werther and when she introduc the subject he allow
the convers to die awai or els he direct the discours into
anoth channel
the vain attempt werther had made to save the unhappi murder wa the
last feebl glimmer of a flame about to be extinguish he sank
almost immedi afterward into a state of gloom and inact until
he wa at length brought to perfect distract by learn that he
wa to be summon as a wit against the prison who assert hi
complet innoc
hi mind now becam oppress by the recollect of everi misfortun
of hi past life the mortif he had suffer at the ambassador
and hi subsequ troubl were reviv in hi memori he becam
utterli inact destitut of energi he wa cut off from everi pursuit
and occup which compos the busi of common life and he becam
a victim to hi own suscept and to hi restless passion for the
most amiabl and belov of women whose peac he destroi in thi
unvari monotoni of exist hi dai were consum and hi power
becam exhaust without aim or design until thei brought him to a
sorrow end
a few letter which he left behind and which we here subjoin afford
the best proof of hi anxieti of mind and of the depth of hi passion
as well as of hi doubt and struggl and of hi weari of life

in the meantim charlott wa in a pitiabl state of mind after her
last convers with werther she found how pain to herself it
would be to declin hi visit and knew how sever he would suffer
from their separ
she had in convers with albert mention casual that werther
would not return befor christma ev and soon afterward albert went
on horseback to see a person in the neighbourhood with whom he had to
transact some busi which would detain him all night
charlott wa sit alon none of her famili were near and she gave
herself up to the reflect that silent took possess of her mind
she wa for ever unit to a husband whose love and fidel she had
prove to whom she wa heartili devot and who seem to be a special
gift from heaven to ensur her happi on the other hand werther had
becom dear to her there wa a cordial unanim of sentiment between
them from the veri first hour of their acquaint and their long
associ and repeat interview had made an indel impress
upon her heart she had been accustom to commun to him everi
thought and feel which interest her and hi absenc threaten to
open a void in her exist which it might be imposs to fill how
heartili she wish that she might chang him into her brotherthat
she could induc him to marri on of her own friend or could
reestablish hi intimaci with albert
she pass all her intim friend in review befor her mind but found
someth objection in each and could decid upon none to whom she
would consent to give him
amid all these consider she felt deepli but indistinctli that her
own real but unexpress wish wa to retain him for herself and her
pure and amiabl heart felt from thi thought a sens of oppress
which seem to forbid a prospect of happi she wa wretch a dark
cloud obscur her mental vision
it wa now halfpast six oclock and she heard werther step on the
stair she at onc recognis hi voic as he inquir if she were at

by their presenc might prevent her be left alon with werther he
put down some book he had brought with him then made inquiri about
some other until she began to hope that her friend might arriv
shortli entertain at the same time a desir that thei might stai
awai

adjoin room then she chang her mind werther meanwhil walk
impati up and down she went to the piano and determin not

were realis in a wai that she could neither forese nor avoid her
blood wa boil in her vein and a thousand pain sensat rent
her pure heart wa it the ardour of werther passion embrac that
she felt within her bosom wa it anger at hi dare wa it the sad
comparison of her present condit with former dai of innoc
tranquil and selfconfid how could she approach her husband
and confess a scene which she had no reason to conceal and which she
yet felt nevertheless unwil to avow thei had preserv so long a
silenc toward each other and should she be the first to break it by so
unexpect a discoveri she fear that the mere statement of werther
visit would troubl him and hi distress would be heighten by her
perfect candour she wish that he could see her in her true light and
judg her without prejudic but wa she anxiou that he should read her
inmost soul on the other hand could she deceiv a be to whom all
her thought had ever been expos as clearli as crystal and from whom
no sentiment had ever been conceal these reflect made her anxiou
and thought her mind still dwelt on werther who wa now lost to
her but whom she could not bring herself to resign and for whom she
knew noth wa left but despair if she should be lost to him for ever
a recollect of that mysteri estrang which had late
subsist between herself and albert and which she could never

to conceal hi anxiou desir to quit thi world he had often discuss
the subject with albert and between the latter and charlott it had
not unfrequ form a topic of convers albert wa so oppos
to the veri idea of such an action that with a degre of irrit
unusu in him he had more than onc given werther to understand that
he doubt the serious of hi threat and not onli turn them into
ridicul but caus charlott to share hi feel of incredul
her heart wa thu tranquillis when she felt dispos to view
the melancholi subject in a seriou point of view though she never
