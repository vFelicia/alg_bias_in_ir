thi book wa written primarili for student of forestri to whom
a knowledg of the technic properti of wood is essenti
the mechan involv is reduc to the simplest term and
without refer to higher mathemat with which the student
rare ar familiar the intent throughout ha been to avoid
all unnecessarili technic languag and descript therebi
make the subjectmatt readili avail to everi on
interest in wood
part i is devot to a discuss of the mechan properti
of woodth relat of wood materi to stress and strain
much of the subjectmatt is mere elementari mechan of
materi in gener though written with refer to wood in
particular numer tabl ar includ show the variou
strength valu of mani of the more import american wood
part ii deal with the factor affect the mechan
properti of wood thi is a subject of interest to all who ar
concern in the ration us of wood and to the forest it
also by retrospect suggest wai and mean of regul
hi forest product through control of the condit of
product attempt ha been made in the light of all data at
hand to answer mani moot question such as the effect on the
qualiti of wood of rate of growth season of cut heartwood
and sapwood local of growth weight water content

part i the mechan properti of wood
introduct
the mechan properti of wood ar it fit and abil to
resist appli or extern forc by extern forc is meant
ani forc outsid of a given piec of materi which tend to
deform it in ani manner it is larg such properti that
determin the us of wood for structur and build purpos
and innumer other us of which furnitur vehicl
implement and tool handl ar a few common exampl
knowledg of these properti is obtain through
experiment either in the employ of the wood in practic
or by mean of special test apparatu in the laboratori
ow to the wide rang of variat in wood it is necessari
that a great number of test be made and that so far as possibl
all disturb factor be elimin for comparison of
differ kind or size a standard method of test is
necessari and the valu must be express in some defin
unit for these reason laboratori experi if properli
conduct have mani advantag over ani other method
on object of such investig is to find unit valu for
strength and stiff etc these becaus of the complex
structur of wood cannot have a constant valu which will be
exactli repeat in each test even though no error be made the
most that can be accomplish is to find averag valu the
amount of variat abov and below and the law which govern
the variat on account of the great variabl in strength
of differ specimen of wood even from the same stick and
appear to be alik it is import to elimin as far as
possibl all extran factor liabl to influenc the result
of the test
the mechan properti of wood consid in thi book ar
1 stiff and elast 2 tensil strength 3
compress or crush strength 4 shear strength 5
transvers or bend strength 6 tough 7 hard 8
cleavabl 9 resili in connect with these
associ properti of import ar briefli treat
in make us of figur indic the strength or other
mechan properti of wood for the purpos of compar the
rel merit of differ speci the fact should be born
in mind that there is a consider rang in variabl of
each individu materi and that small differ such as a
few hundr pound in valu of 10000 pound cannot be
consid as a criterion of the qualiti of the timber in
test materi of the same kind and grade differ of 25
per cent between individu specimen mai be expect in
conif and 50 per cent or even more in hardwood the figur
given in the tabl should be taken as indic rather than
fix valu and as applic to a larg number collect
and not to individu piec
fundament consider and definit
studi of the mechan properti of a materi is concern
mostli with it behavior in relat to stress and strain
and the factor affect thi behavior a stress is a
distribut forc and mai be defin as the mutual action 1 of
on bodi upon anoth or 2 of on part of a bodi upon anoth
part in the first case the stress is extern in the other
intern the same stress mai be intern from on point of
view and extern from anoth an extern forc is alwai
balanc by the intern stress when the bodi is in
equilibrium
if no extern forc act upon a bodi it particl assum
certain rel posit and it ha what is call it
natur shape and size if suffici extern forc is
appli the natur shape and size will be chang thi
distort or deform of the materi is known as the
strain everi stress produc a correspond strain and
within a certain limit see elast limit in fundament
consider and definit abov the strain is directli
proport to the stress produc it1 the same intens
of stress howev doe not produc the same strain in
differ materi or in differ qualiti of the same
materi no strain would be produc in a perfectli rigid bodi
but such is not known to exist
footnot 1 thi is in accord with the discoveri made in
1678 by robert hook and is known as hook law
stress is measur in pound or other unit of weight or forc
a unit stress is the stress on a unit of the section
p
area unit stress for instanc if a load p of on
a
hundr pound is uniformli support by a vertic post with a
crosssect area a of ten squar inch the unit
compress stress is ten pound per squar inch
strain is measur in inch or other linear unit a unit
strain is the strain per unit of length thu if a post 10
inch long befor compress is 99 inch long under the
compress stress the total strain is 01 inch and the unit
l 01
strain is 001 inch per inch of length
l 10
as the stress increas there is a correspond increas in the
strain thi ratio mai be graphic shown by mean of a
diagram or curv plot with the increment of load or stress
as ordin and the increment of strain as absciss thi is
known as the stressstrain diagram within the limit mention
abov the diagram is a straight line see fig 1 if the
result of similar experi on differ specimen ar
plot to the same scale the diagram furnish a readi mean
for comparison the greater the resist a materi offer to
deform the steeper or nearer the vertic axi will be the
line
illustr fig 1stressstrain diagram of two longleaf
pine beam el elast limit the area of the triangl
0ela and 0elb repres the elast resili of the dry
and green beam respect
there ar three kind of intern stress name 1
tensil 2 compress and 3 shear when extern
forc act upon a bar in a direct awai from it end or a
direct pull the stress is a tensil stress when toward the
end or a direct push compress stress in the first instanc
the strain is an elong in the second a shorten
whenev the forc tend to caus on portion of the materi to
slide upon anoth adjac to it the action is call a
shear the action is that of an ordinari pair of shear when
rivet plate slide on each other the rivet ar shear off
these three simpl stress mai act togeth produc compound
stress as in flexur when a bow is bent there is a
compress of the fibr on the inner or concav side and an
elong of the fibr on the outer or convex side there is
also a tendenc of the variou fibr to slide past on anoth
in a longitudin direct if the bow were made of two or more
separ piec of equal length it would be note on bend
that slip occur along the surfac of contact and that
the end would no longer be even if these piec were secur
glu togeth thei would no longer slip but the tendenc to do
so would exist just the same moreov it would be found in the
latter case that the bow would be much harder to bend than where
the piec were not glu togetherin other word the
stiff of the bow would be materi increas
stiff is the properti by mean of which a bodi act upon
by extern forc tend to retain it natur size and shape
or resist deform thu a materi that is difficult to
bend or otherwis deform is stiff on that is easili bent or
otherwis deform is flexibl flexibl is not the exact
counterpart of stiff as it also involv tough and
pliabil
if success larger load ar appli to a bodi and then
remov it will be found that at first the bodi complet
regain it origin form upon releas from the stressin other
word the bodi is elast no substanc known is perfectli
elast though mani ar practic so under small load
eventu a point will be reach where the recoveri of the
specimen is incomplet thi point is known as the elast
limit which mai be defin as the limit beyond which it is
imposs to carri the distort of a bodi without produc a
perman alter in shape after thi limit ha been
exceed the size and shape of the specimen after remov of
the load will not be the same as befor and the differ or
amount of chang is known as the perman set
elast limit as measur in test and us in design mai be
defin as that unit stress at which the deform begin to
increas in a faster ratio than the appli load in practic
the elast limit of a materi under test is determin from
the stressstrain diagram it is that point in the line where
the diagram begin percept to curve2 see fig 1
footnot 2 if the straight portion doe not pass through the
origin a parallel line should be drawn through the origin and
the load at elast limit taken from thi line see fig 32
resili is the amount of work done upon a bodi in deform
it within the elast limit it is also a measur of the
potenti energi store in the materi and repres the
amount of work the materi would do upon be releas from a
state of stress thi mai be graphic repres by a
diagram in which the absciss repres the amount of deflect
and the ordin the forc act the area includ between
the stressstrain curv and the initi line which is zero
repres the work done see fig 1 if the unit of space is
in inch and the unit of forc is in pound the result is
inchpound if the elast limit is taken as the apex of the
triangl the area of the triangl will repres the elast
resili of the specimen thi amount of work can be appli
repeatedli and is perhap the best measur of the tough of
the wood as a work qualiti though it is not synonym with
tough
perman set is due to the plastic of the materi a
perfectli plastic substanc would have no elast and the
smallest forc would caus a set lead and moist clai ar
nearli plastic and wood possess thi properti to a greater or
less extent the plastic of wood is increas by wet
heat and especi by steam and boil were it not for
thi properti it would be imposs to dry wood without
destroi complet it cohes due to the irregular of
shrinkag
a substanc that can undergo littl chang in shape without
break or ruptur is brittl chalk and glass ar common
exampl of brittl materi sometim the word brash is
us to describ thi condit in wood a brittl wood break
suddenli with a clean instead of a splinteri fractur and
without warn such wood ar unfit to resist shock or
sudden applic of load
the measur of the stiff of wood is term the modulu of
elast or coeffici of elast it is the ratio of
stress per unit of area to the deform per unit of
unit stress
length e it is a number indic of
unit strain
stiff not of strength and onli appli to condit
within the elast limit it is nearli the same whether deriv
from compress test or from tension test

tensil strength
tension result when a pull forc is appli to opposit
end of a bodi thi extern pull is commun to the
interior so that ani portion of the materi exert a pull or
tensil forc upon the remaind the abil to do so depend
upon the properti of cohes the result is an elong or
stretch of the materi in the direct of the appli
forc the action is the opposit of compress
wood exhibit it greatest strength in tension parallel to the
grain and it is veri uncommon in practic for a specimen to be
pull in two lengthwis thi is due to the difficulti of
make the end fasten secur enough for the full tensil
strength to be brought into plai befor the fasten shear off
longitudin thi is not the case with metal and as a
result thei ar us in almost all place where tensil strength
is particularli need even though the remaind of the
structur such as sill beam joist post and floor
mai be of wood thu in a wooden truss bridg the tension
member ar steel rod
the tensil strength of wood parallel to the grain depend upon
the strength of the fibr and is affect not onli by the
natur and dimens of the wood element but also by their
arrang it is greatest in straightgrain specimen with

compress or crush strength
compress across the grain is veri close relat to
hard and transvers shear there ar two wai in which wood
is subject to stress of thi kind name 1 with the load
act over the entir area of the specimen and 2 with a load
concentr over a portion of the area see fig 2 the
latter is the condit more commonli met with in practic as
for exampl where a post rest on a horizont sill or a rail
rest on a crossti the former condit howev give the
true resist of the grain to simpl crush
illustr fig 2compress across the grain
the first effect of compress across the grain is to compact
the fibr the load gradual but irregularli increas as the
densiti of the materi is increas if the specimen li on a
flat surfac and the load is appli to onli a portion of the
upper area the bear plate indent the wood crush the
upper fibr without affect the lower part see fig 3 as
the load increas the project end sometim split
horizont see fig 4 the irregular in the load ar
due to the fact that the fibr collaps a few at a time
begin with those with the thinnest wall the project of
the end increas the strength of the materi directli beneath
the compress weight by introduc a beam action which help
support the load thi influenc is exert for a short distanc
onli
illustr fig 3side view of failur in compress
across the grain show crush of block under bear
plate specimen at right show split at end
illustr fig 4end view of failur in compress
across the grain show split of the end of the test
specimen
when wood is us for column prop post and spoke the
weight of the load tend to shorten the materi endwis thi
is endwis compress or compress parallel to the grain
in the case of long column that is piec in which the length
is veri great compar with their diamet the failur is by
sidewis bend or flexur instead of by crush or
split see fig 5 a familiar instanc of thi action is
afford by a flexibl walkingstick if downward pressur is
exert with the hand on the upper end of the stick place
vertic on the floor it will be note that a definit amount
of forc must be appli in each instanc befor decid flexur
take place after thi point is reach a veri slight increas
of pressur veri larg increas the deflect thu
obtain so great a leverag about the middl section as to
caus ruptur

the later bend of a column produc a combin of
bend with compress stress over the section the
compress stress be maximum at the section of greatest
deflect on the concav side the convex surfac is under
tension as in an ordinari beam test see fig 6 if the same
stick is brace in such a wai that flexur is prevent it
support strength is increas enorm sinc the
compress stress act uniformli over the section and failur
is by crush or split as in small block in all column
free to bend in ani direct the deflect will be seen in the
direct in which the column is least stiff thi sidewis
bend can be overcom by make pillar and column thicker in
the middl than at the end and by brace stud prop and
compress member of truss the strength of a column also
depend to a consider extent upon whether the end ar free
to turn or ar fix

maximum load is the greatest load a materi will support and
is usual greater than the load at ruptur
safe load is the load consid safe for a materi to
support in actual practic it is alwai less than the load at
elast limit and is usual taken as a certain proport of
the ultim or break load
the ratio of the break to the safe load is call the factor
of safeti factor of safeti ultim strength safe load in
order to make due allow for the natur variat and
imperfect in wood and in the aggreg structur as well as
for variat in the load the factor of safeti is usual as
high as 6 or 10 especi if the safeti of human life depend
upon the structur thi mean that onli from onesixth to
onetenth of the comput strength valu is consid safe to
us if the depth of timber exce four time their thick
there is a great tendenc for the materi to twist when load

harmon repetit which is frequent seriou in the case
of bridg
1 static load or the gradual imposit of load so that
the move part acquir no appreci momentum load ar so
appli in the ordinari test machin
2 sudden imposit of load without initi veloc thu
in the case of place a load on a beam if the load be brought
into contact with the beam but it weight sustain by extern
mean as by a cord and then thi extern support be
suddenli instantan remov as by quickli cut the
cord then although the load is alreadi touch the beam and
henc there is no real impact yet the beam is at first
offer no resist as it ha yet suffer no deform
furthermor as the beam deflect the resist increas but
doe not come to be equal to the load until it ha attain it
normal deflect in the meantim there ha been an unbalanc
forc of graviti act of a constantli diminish amount
equal at first to the entir load at the normal deflect but
at thi instant the load and the beam ar in motion the
hitherto unbalanc forc have produc an acceler
veloc and thi veloc of the weight and beam give to them
an energi or vi viva which must now spend itself in
overcom an excess of resist over and abov the impos
load and the whole mass will not stop until the deflect as
well as the resist ha come to be equal to twice that
correspond to the static load impos henc we sai the
effect of a suddenli impos load is to produc twice the
deflect and stress of the same load static appli it
must be evid howev that thi case ha noth in common
with either the ordinari static test of structur materi
in testingmachin or with impact tests13

3 impact shock or blow14 there ar variou common
us of wood where the materi is subject to sudden shock
and jar or impact such is the action on the fello and spoke
of a wagon wheel pass over a rough road on a hammer handl
when a blow is struck on a maul when it strike a wedg
footnot 14 see tiemann harri d the theori of impact and
it applic to test materi jour franklin inst

resist to impact is resist to energi which is measur
by the product of the forc into the space through which it
move or by the product of onehalf the move mass which
caus the shock into the squar of it veloc the work done
upon the piec at the instant the veloc is entir remov
from the strike bodi is equal to the total energi of that
bodi it is imposs howev to get all of the energi of the
strike bodi store in the specimen though the greater the
mass and the shorter the space through which it move or in
other word the greater the proport of weight and the
smaller the proport of veloc make up the energi of the
strike bodi the more energi the specimen will absorb the
rest is lost in friction vibrat heat and motion of the
anvil
in impact the stress produc becom veri complex and
difficult to measur especi if the veloc is high or the
mass of the beam itself is larg compar to that of the weight
the difficulti attend the measur of the stress
beyond the elast limit ar so great that commonli thei ar not
reckon within the elast limit the formul for calcul
the stress ar base on the assumpt that the deflect is
proport to the stress in thi case as in static test
a common method of make test upon the resist of wood to
shock is to support a small beam at the end and drop a heavi
weight upon it in the middl see fig 40 the height of the
weight is increas after each drop and record of the
deflect taken until failur the total work done upon the
specimen is equal to the area of the stressstrain diagram plu
the effect of local inertia of the molecul at point of
contact
the stress involv in impact ar complic by the fact that
there ar variou wai in which the energi of the strike bodi
mai be spent
a it produc a local deform of both bodi at the
surfac of contact within or beyond the elast limit in
test wood the compress of the substanc of the steel
strikingweight mai be neglect sinc the steel is veri hard
in comparison with the wood in addit to the compress of
the fibr at the surfac of contact resist is also offer
by the inertia of the particl there the combin effect of
which is a stress at the surfac of contact often entir out
of proport to the compress which would result from the
action of a static forc of the same magnitud it frequent
exce the crush strength at the extrem surfac of contact
as in the case of the swage action of a hammer on the head of
an iron spike or of a locomot wheel on the steel rail thi
is also the case when a bullet is shot through a board or a pane
of glass without break it as a whole
b it mai move the struck bodi as a whole with an acceler
veloc the resist consist of the inertia of the bodi
thi effect is seen when a croquet ball is struck with a mallet
c it mai deform a fix bodi against it extern support
and resist in make impact test in the laboratori the
test specimen is in realiti in the natur of a cushion between
two impact bodi name the strike weight and the base
of the machin it is import that the mass of thi base be
suffici great that it rel veloc to that of the
common centr of graviti of itself and the strike weight mai
be disregard
d it mai deform the struck bodi as a whole against the
resist stress develop by it own inertia as for
exampl when a basebal bat is broken by strike the ball

impact test is difficult to conduct satisfactorili and the

for compar the shockresist abil of wood of which like

yet thi test is on of the most import made on wood as it
bring out properti not evid from other test defect and
brittl ar reveal by impact better than by ani other kind

failur in timber beam
if a beam is load too heavili it will break or fail in some
characterist manner these failur mai be classifi
accord to the wai in which thei develop as tension
compress and horizont shear and accord to the
appear of the broken surfac as brash and fibrou a
number of form mai develop if the beam is complet ruptur
sinc the tensil strength of wood is on the averag about three
time as great as the compress strength a beam should
therefor be expect to fail by the format in the first
place of a fold on the compress side due to the crush
action follow by failur on the tension side thi is usual
the case in green or moist wood in dry materi the first
visibl failur is not infrequ on the lower or tension
side and variou attempt have been made to explain why such is
the case15
footnot 15 see proc int assn for test materi 1912
xxiii2 pp 1213
within the elast limit the elong and shorten ar
equal and the neutral plane li in the middl of the beam
see transvers or bend strength beam abov later the
top layer of fibr on the upper or compress side fail and
on the load increas the next layer of fibr fail and so
on even though thi failur mai not be visibl as a result the
shorten on the upper side of the beam becom consider
greater than the elong on the lower side the neutral
plane must be presum to sink gradual toward the tension
side and when the stress on the outer fibr at the bottom
have becom suffici great the fibr ar pull in two
the tension area be much smaller than the compress area
the ruptur is often irregular as in direct tension test
failur mai occur partial in singl bundl of fibr some
time befor the final failur take place on reason why the
failur of a dry beam is differ from on that is moist is
that dry increas the stiff of the fibr so that thei
offer more resist to crush while it ha much less effect
upon the tensil strength
there is consider variat in tension failur depend
upon the tough or the brittl of the wood the
arrang of the grain defect etc make further
classif desir the four most common form ar
1simpl tension in which there is a direct pull in two
of the wood on the under side of the beam due to a tensil
stress parallel to the grain see fig 17 no 1 thi is
common in straightgrain beam particularli when the wood is
season
illustr fig 17characterist failur of simpl
beam
2crossgrain tension in which the fractur is caus by a
tensil forc act obliqu to the grain see fig 17 no 2
thi is a common form of failur where the beam ha diagon
spiral or other form of cross grain on it lower side sinc the
tensil strength of wood across the grain is onli a small
fraction of that with the grain it is easi to see why a
crossgrain timber would fail in thi manner
3splinter tension in which the failur consist of a
consider number of slight tension failur produc a
rag or splinteri break on the under surfac of the beam see
fig 17 no 3 thi is common in tough wood in thi case the
surfac of fractur is fibrou
4brittl tension in which the beam fail by a clean break
extend entir through it see fig 17 no 4 it is
characterist of a brittl wood which give wai suddenli
without warn like a piec of chalk in thi case the surfac
of fractur is describ as brash
compress failur see fig 17 no 5 ha few variat
except that it appear at variou distanc from the neutral
plane of the beam it is veri common in green timber the
compress stress parallel to the fibr caus them to buckl
or bend as in an endwis compress test thi action usual
begin on the top side shortli after the elast limit is
reach and extend downward sometim almost reach the
neutral plane befor complet failur occur frequent two or
more failur develop at about the same time
horizont shear failur in which the upper and lower
portion of the beam slide along each other for a portion of
their length either at on or at both end see fig 17 no 6
is fairli common in airdri materi and in green materi when
the ratio of the height of the beam to the span is rel
larg it is not common in small clear specimen it is often
due to shake or season check common in larg timber which
reduc the actual area resist the shear action
consider below the calcul area us in the formul for
horizont shear see page 98 for thi formul for thi
reason it is unsaf in design larg timber beam to us
shear stress higher than those calcul for beam that
fail in horizont shear the effect of a failur in
horizont shear is to divid the beam into two or more beam
the combin strength of which is much less than that of the
origin beam fig 18 show a larg beam in which two failur
in horizont shear occur at the same end that the part
behav independ is shown by the compress failur below

tough torsion
tough is a term appli to more than on properti of wood
thu wood that is difficult to split is said to be tough again
a tough wood is on that will not ruptur until it ha deform
consider under load at or near it maximum strength or on
which still hang togeth after it ha been ruptur and mai be
bent back and forth without break apart tough includ
flexibl and is the revers of brittl in that tough
wood break gradual and give warn of failur tough wood
offer great resist to impact and will permit rougher
treatment in manipul attend manufactur and us
tough is depend upon the strength cohes qualiti
length and arrang of fibr and the pliabil of the
wood conifer wood as a rule ar not as tough as hardwood
of which hickori and elm ar the best exampl
the torsion or twist test is us in determin the
tough of wood if the end of a shaft ar turn in opposit
direct or on end is turn and the other is fix all of
the fibr except those at the axi tend to assum the form of
helic see fig 19 the strain produc by torsion or
twist is essenti shear transvers and parallel to the
fibr combin with longitudin tension and transvers
compress within the elast limit the strain increas
directli as the distanc from the axi of the specimen the
outer element ar subject to tensil stress and as thei
becom twist tend to compress those near the axi the
elong element also contract later cross section which
were origin plane becom warp with increas strain the
later adhes of the outer fibr is destroi allow them
to slide past each other and reduc greatli their power of
resist in thi wai the strain on the fibr nearer the
axi ar progress increas until final all of the
element ar shear apart it is onli in the toughest materi
that the full effect of thi action can be observ see fig

resist to indent and 2 resist to abras or

is a measur of the wear abil of wood and is an import
consider in the us of wood for floor pave block
bear and roller while resist to indent is
depend mostli upon the densiti of the wood the wear
qualiti mai be govern by other factor such as tough
and the size cohes and arrang of the fibr in us
for floor some wood tend to compact and wear smooth while
other becom splinteri and rough thi featur is affect to
some extent by the manner in which the wood is saw thu

thei appear as ringsoften spoken of as annual ring these
growth layer ar made up of wood cell of variou kind but
for the most part fibrou in timber like pine spruce

1 in gener rapidli grown wood less than eight ring per
inch is rel weak a studi of the individu test upon
which the averag point ar base show howev that when it
is not associ with light weight and a small proport of
summer wood rapid growth is not indic of weak wood
2 an averag rate of growth indic by from 12 to 16 ring
per inch seem to produc the best materi
3 in rate of growth lower than 16 ring per inch the
averag strength of the materi decreas appar
approach a uniform condit abov 24 ring per inch in such
slow rate of growth the textur of the wood is veri uniform
and natur there is littl variat in weight or strength
an analysi of test on larg beam wa made to ascertain if
averag rate of growth ha ani relat to the mechan
properti of the beam the analysi indic conclus
that there wa no such relat averag rate of growth without
consider also of densiti therefor ha littl
signific in grade structur timber18 thi is becaus
of the wide variat in the percentag of late wood in

no satisfactori explan can as yet be given for the real
caus underli the format of earli and late wood sever
factor mai be involv in conif at least rate of growth
alon doe not determin the proport of the two portion of
the ring for in some case the wood of slow growth is veri hard
and heavi while in other the opposit is true the qualiti of
the site where the tree grow undoubtedli affect the charact
of the wood form though it is not possibl to formul a
rule govern it in gener howev it mai be said that
where strength or eas of work is essenti wood of
moder to slow growth should be chosen but in choos a
particular specimen it is not the width of ring but the
proport and charact of the late wood which should govern
in the case of the ringpor hardwood there seem to exist a
pretti definit relat between the rate of growth of timber
and it properti thi mai be briefli sum up in the gener
statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the ring
of growth the heavier harder stronger and stiffer the wood
thi it must be rememb appli onli to ringpor wood
such as oak ash hickori and other of the same group and is
of cours subject to some except and limit
in ringpor wood of good growth it is usual the middl
portion of the ring in which the thickwal strengthgiv
fibr ar most abund as the breadth of ring diminish
thi middl portion is reduc so that veri slow growth produc
compar light porou wood compos of thinwal vessel
and wood parenchyma in good oak these larg vessel of the
earli wood occupi from 6 to 10 per cent of the volum of the
log while in inferior materi thei mai make up 25 per cent or
more the late wood of good oak except for radial grayish
patch of small pore is dark color and firm and consist
of thickwal fibr which form onehalf or more of the wood
in inferior oak such fibr area ar much reduc both in
quantiti and qualiti such variat is veri larg the result
of rate of growth
widering wood is often call secondgrowth becaus the
growth of the young timber in open stand after the old tree
have been remov is more rapid than in tree in the forest and
in the manufactur of articl where strength is an import
consider such secondgrowth hardwood materi is
prefer thi is particularli the case in the choic of
hickori for handl and spoke here not onli strength but
tough and resili ar import the result of a seri
of test on hickori by the us forest servic show that the
work or shockresist abil is greatest in widering wood
that ha from 5 to 14 ring per inch is fairli constant from 14
to 38 ring and decreas rapidli from 38 to 47 ring the
strength at maximum load is not so great with the most
rapidgrow wood it is maximum with from 14 to 20 ring per
inch and again becom less as the wood becom more close
ring the natur deduct is that wood of firstclass
mechan valu show from 5 to 20 ring per inch and that
slower growth yield poorer stock thu the inspector or buyer
of hickori should discrimin against timber that ha more than
20 ring per inch except exist howev in the case of
normal growth upon dry situat in which the slowgrow
materi mai be strong and tough20

the effect of rate of growth on the qualiti of chestnut wood
is summar by the same author as follow when the ring
ar wide the transit from spring wood to summer wood is
gradual while in the narrow ring the spring wood pass into
summer wood abruptli the width of the spring wood chang but
littl with the width of the annual ring so that the narrow
or broaden of the annual ring is alwai at the expens of the
summer wood the narrow vessel of the summer wood make it
richer in wood substanc than the spring wood compos of wide
vessel therefor rapidgrow specimen with wide ring have
more wood substanc than slowgrow tree with narrow ring
sinc the more the wood substanc the greater the weight and
the greater the weight the stronger the wood chestnut with
wide ring must have stronger wood than chestnut with narrow
ring thi agre with the accept view that sprout which
alwai have wide ring yield better and stronger wood than
seedl chestnut which grow more slowli in diameter21

in diffusepor wood as ha been state the vessel or
pore ar scatter throughout the ring instead of collect in
the earli wood the effect of rate of growth is therefor not
the same as in the ringpor wood approach more nearli
the condit in the conif in gener it mai be state that
such wood of medium growth afford stronger materi than when
veri rapidli or veri slowli grown in mani us of wood
strength is not the main consider if eas of work is
prize wood should be chosen with regard to it uniform of
textur and straight of grain which will in most case
occur when there is littl contrast between the late wood of on
season growth and the earli wood of the next
heartwood and sapwood
examin of the end of a log of mani speci reveal a

slight so that it is not alwai easi to tell where on leav

light sometim pure white but more often with a decid ting

sapwood is compar new wood there is a time in the earli
histori of everi tree when it wood is all sapwood it
princip function ar to conduct water from the root to the
leav and to store up and give back accord to the season the
food prepar in the leav the more leav a tree bear and
the more thrifti it growth the larger the volum of sapwood
requir henc tree make rapid growth in the open have
thicker sapwood for their size than tree of the same speci
grow in dens forest sometim tree grown in the open mai
becom of consider size a foot or more in diamet befor
ani heartwood begin to form for exampl in secondgrowth
hickori or fieldgrown white and loblolli pine
as a tree increas in ag and diamet an inner portion of the
sapwood becom inact and final ceas to function thi
inert or dead portion is call heartwood deriv it name
sole from it posit and not from ani vital import to
the tree as is shown by the fact that a tree can thrive with
it heart complet decai some speci begin to form
heartwood veri earli in life while in other the chang come
slowli thin sapwood is characterist of such tree as
chestnut black locust mulberri osag orang and sassafra
while in mapl ash gum hickori hackberri beech and
loblolli pine thick sapwood is the rule
there is no definit relat between the annual ring of growth
and the amount of sapwood within the same speci the
crosssect area of the sapwood is roughli proport to
the size of the crown of the tree if the ring ar narrow more
of them ar requir than where thei ar wide as the tree get
larger the sapwood must necessarili becom thinner or increas
materi in volum sapwood is thicker in the upper portion of
the trunk of a tree than near the base becaus the ag and the
diamet of the upper section ar less
when a tree is veri young it is cover with limb almost if
not entir to the ground but as it grow older some or all
of them will eventu die and be broken off subsequ growth
of wood mai complet conceal the stub which howev will
remain as knot no matter how smooth and clear a log is on the
outsid it is more or less knotti near the middl consequ
the sapwood of an old tree and particularli of a forestgrown
tree will be freer from knot than the heartwood sinc in most
us of wood knot ar defect that weaken the timber and
interfer with it eas of work and other properti it
follow that sapwood becaus of it posit in the tree mai
have certain advantag over heartwood
it is realli remark that the inner heartwood of old tree
remain as sound as it usual doe sinc in mani case it is
hundr of year and in a few instanc thousand of year
old everi broken limb or root or deep wound from fire
insect or fall timber mai afford an entranc for decai
which onc start mai penetr to all part of the trunk
the larv of mani insect bore into the tree and their tunnel
remain indefinit as sourc of weak whatev advantag
howev that sapwood mai have in thi connect ar due sole
to it rel ag and posit
if a tree grow all it life in the open and the condit of
soil and site remain unchang it will make it most rapid
growth in youth and gradual declin the annual ring of
growth ar for mani year quit wide but later thei becom
narrow and narrow sinc each succeed ring is laid down
on the outsid of the wood previous form it follow that
unless a tree materi increas it product of wood from
year to year the ring must necessarili becom thinner as a
tree reach matur it crown becom more open and the annual
wood product is lessen therebi reduc still more the
width of the growth ring in the case of forestgrown tree so
much depend upon the competit of the tree in their struggl
for light and nourish that period of rapid and slow growth
mai altern some tree such as southern oak maintain the
same width of ring for hundr of year upon the whole
howev as a tree get larger in diamet the width of the
growth ring decreas
it is evid that there mai be decid differ in the grain
of heartwood and sapwood cut from a larg tree particularli on
that is overmatur the relationship between width of growth
ring and the mechan properti of wood is discuss under
rate of growth in thi connect howev it mai be state
that as a gener rule the wood laid on late in the life of a
tree is softer lighter weaker and more eventextur than
that produc earlier it follow that in a larg log the
sapwood becaus of the time in the life of the tree when it wa
grown mai be inferior in hard strength and tough to
equal sound heartwood from the same log
after exhaust test on a number of differ wood the us
forest servic conclud as follow sapwood except that from
old overmatur tree is as strong as heartwood other thing
be equal and so far as the mechan properti go should
not be regard as a defect22 care inspect of the

in the studi of the hickori the conclus wa there is an

the sapwood nearest the bark is compar weak and the best

the best wood is in the sap23 the result of test from
select piec ly side by side in the same tree and also
the averag valu for heartwood and sapwood in shipment of the

the transform of sapwood into heartwood doe not affect

specif for pave block often requir that longleaf

not onli more subject to decai but is also weaker than
heartwood in realiti there is no sound basi for discrimin
against sapwood on account of strength provid other
condit ar equal it is true that sapwood will not resist
decai as long as heartwood if both ar untreat with

heartwood and is due to infiltr of tannin oil and

usual no differ in structur observ under the

flexur as in beam
spiral grain is a veri common defect in a tree and when
excess render the timber valueless for us except in the
round it is produc by the arrang of the wood fibr in a
spiral direct about the axi instead of exactli vertic
timber with spiral grain is also known as tors wood spiral
grain usual cannot be detect by casual inspect of a
stick sinc it doe not show in the socal visibl grain of
the wood by which is commonli meant a section view of the
annual ring of growth cut longitudin it is accordingli
veri easi to allow spiralgrain materi to pass inspect
therebi introduc an element of weak in a structur
there ar method for readili detect spiral grain the
simplest is that of split a small piec radial it is
necessari of cours that the split be radial that is in a
plane pass through the axi of the log and not tangenti
in the latter case it is quit probabl that the wood would
split straight the line of cleavag be between the growth
ring
in inspect the element to examin ar the rai in the case
of oak and certain other hardwood these rai ar so larg that
thei ar readili seen not onli on a radial surfac but on the
tangenti as well on the former thei appear as flake on the
latter as short line sinc these rai ar between the fibr
it natur follow that thei will be vertic or inclin
accord as the tree is straightgrain or spiralgrain
while thei ar not conspicu in the softwood thei can be
seen upon close scrutini and particularli so if a small hand
magnifi is us
when wood ha begun to dry and check it is veri easi to see
whether or not it is straight or spiralgrain sinc the
check will for the most part follow along the rai if on
examin a row of telephon pole for exampl he will probabl
find that most of them have check run spiral around them
if board were saw from such a pole after it wa badli check
thei would fall to piec of their own weight the onli wai to
get straight materi would be to split it out
it is for thi reason that split billet and squar ar
stronger than most saw materi the presenc of the spiral
grain ha littl if ani effect on the timber when it is us
in the round but in saw materi the greater the pitch of the
spiral the greater is the defect

on of the moot question among hickori men is the rel
valu of northern and southern hickori the impress prevail

southern hickori have a greater tendenc to be shaki and thi
result in much wast in tree from southern river bottom the
loss through shake and grubhol in mani case amount to as

it is clear therefor that the differ in northern and
southern hickori is not due to geograph locat but rather
to the charact of timber that is be cut nearli all of that
from southern river bottom and from the cumberland mountain is
from larg oldgrowth tree that from the north is from

season of cut
it is gener believ that winterfel timber ha decid
advantag over that cut at other season of the year and to
that caus alon ar frequent ascrib much greater
durabl less liabil to check and split better color and
even increas strength and tough the conclus from the
variou experi made on the subject is that while the time
of fell mai and often doe affect the properti of wood
such result is due to the weather condit rather than to the
condit of the wood
there ar two phase of thi question on is concern with the
physiolog chang which might take place dure the year in
the wood of a live tree the other deal with the pure
physic result due to the weather as differ in
temperatur humid moistur and other featur to be
mention later
those who adher to the first view maintain that wood cut in
summer is quit differ in composit from that cut in
winter on opinion is that in summer the sap is up while in
winter it is down consequ winterfel timber is drier
a variat of thi belief is that in summer the sap contain
certain chemic which affect the properti of wood and doe
not contain them in winter again it is sometim assert that
wood is actual denser in winter than in summer as part of the
wood substanc is dissolv out in the spring and us for plant
food be restor in the fall
it is obviou that such view could appli onli to sapwood sinc
it alon is in live condit at the time of cut
heartwood is dead wood and ha almost no function in the
exist of the tree other than the pure mechan on of
support heartwood doe undergo chang but thei ar gradual
and almost entir independ of the season
sapwood might reason be expect to respond to season
chang and to some extent it doe just beneath the bark there
is a thin layer of cell which dure the grow season have
not attain their greatest densiti with the except of thi
on annual ring or portion of on the densiti of the wood
substanc of the sapwood is nearli the same the year round
slight variat mai occur due to impregn with sugar and
starch in the winter and it dissolut in the grow season
the time of cut can have no materi effect on the inher
strength and other mechan properti of wood except in the
outermost annual ring of growth
the popular belief that sap is up in the spring and summer and
is down in the winter ha not been substanti by experi
there ar season differ in the composit of sap but so
far as the amount of sap in a tree is concern there is fulli
as much if not more dure the winter than in summer

the import consider in regard to thi question is the
seri of circumst attend the handl of the timber
after it is fell wood dri more rapidli in summer than in
winter not becaus there is less moistur at on time than
anoth but becaus of the higher temperatur in summer thi
greater heat is often accompani by low humid and
condit ar favor for the rapid remov of moistur from
the expos portion of wood wood dri by evapor and
other thing be equal thi will proce much faster in hot
weather than in cold
it is a matter of common observ that when wood dri it
shrink and if shrinkag is not uniform in all direct the
materi pull apart caus season check see fig 27 if
evapor proce more rapidli on the outsid than insid
the greater shrinkag of the outer portion is bound to result
in mani check the number and size increas with the degre
of inequ of dry
in cold weather dry proce slowli but uniformli thu
allow the wood element to adjust themselv with the least
amount of ruptur in summer dry proce rapidli and
irregularli so that materi season at that time is more
like to split and check
there is less danger of sap rot when tree ar fell in winter
becaus the fungu doe not grow in the veri cold weather and
the lumber ha a chanc to season to below the danger point
befor the fungu get a chanc to attack it if the log in
each case could be cut into lumber immedi after fell and

to be note that thei appli onli to wood in a much drier
condit than is us in practic for airdri wood the ratio

for a given surfac area the loss of water from wood is alwai

a wood cell shrink veri littl lengthwis a dry wood cell is
therefor practic of the same length as it wa in a green

thinner wall and a larger caviti it is at onc evid that
thi fact make shrinkag more irregular for wherev cell
cross each other at a decid angl thei will tend to pull apart
upon dry thi occur wherev pith rai and wood fibr
meet a consider portion of everi wood is made up of these
rai which for the most part have their cell ly in a radial
direct instead of longitudin see frontispiec in

tangenti as appli to the posit in a stand tree but
veri littl in length or radial the other element of the
wood shrink radial and tangenti but almost none
lengthwis or vertic as appli to the tree here then we
find the shrinkag of the rai tend to shorten a stick of
wood while the other cell resist it and the tendenc of a
stick to get smaller in circumfer is resist by the endwis
reaction or thrust of the rai onli in a tangenti direct
or around the stick in direct of the annual ring of growth
do the two forc coincid anoth factor to the same end is
that the denser band of late wood ar continu in a
tangenti direct while radial thei ar separ by
altern zone of less dens earli wood consequ the
shrinkag along the ring tangenti is fulli twice as much as
toward the centr radial see tabl xiv thi explain why
some crack open more and more as dry advanc see fig

although actual shrinkag in length is small nevertheless the
tendenc of the rai to shorten a stick produc strain which
ar respons for some of the split open of ti post

the wood is light and weak while farther out it becom denser
and stronger longitudin shrinkag is accordingli least at the

greatest in the sapwood when a round or a boxheart timber
dri fast it split radial and as dry continu the cleft
widen partli on account of the greater tangenti shrinkag and
also becaus the greater contract of the outer fibr warp
the section apart if a small hardwood stem is split while

the us of sshape thin steel clamp to prevent larg check
