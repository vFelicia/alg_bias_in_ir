it is not my intent to write a treatis on apicultur or on
practic beekeep excel work of the kind abound in all
civilis countri and it were useless to attempt anoth franc
ha those of dadant georg de layen and bonnier bertrand hamet
weber clement the abb collin etc englishspeak countri
have langstroth bevan cook cheshir cowan root etc germani
ha dzierzon van berlespoch pollmann vogel and mani other
nor is thi book to be a scientif monograph on api mellifica
ligustica fasciata dorsata etc or a collect of new
observ and studi i shall sai scarc anyth that those
will not know who ar somewhat familiar with bee the note and
experi i have made dure my twenti year of beekeep i shall
reserv for a more technic work for their interest is necessarili
of a special and limit natur and i am anxiou not to overburden
thi essai i wish to speak of the bee veri simpli as on speak
of a subject on know and love to those who know it not i do not
intend to adorn the truth or merit the just reproach reaumur
address to hi predecessor in the studi of our honeyfli whom
he accus of substitut for the marvel realiti marvel that
were imaginari and mere plausibl the fact that the hive contain
so much that is wonder doe not warrant our seek to add to it
wonder besid i myself have now for a long time ceas to look
for anyth more beauti in thi world or more interest than
the truth or at least than the effort on is abl to make toward
the truth i shall state noth therefor that i have not
verifi myself or that is not so fulli accept in the textbook
as to render further verif superflu my fact shall be as
accur as though thei appear in a practic manual or scientif
monograph but i shall relat them in a somewhat liveli fashion
than such work would allow shall group them more harmoni
togeth and blend them with freer and more matur reflect the
reader of thi book will not learn therefrom how to manag a hive
but he will know more or less all that can with ani certainti be
known of the curiou profound and intim side of it
inhabit nor will thi be at the cost of what still remain to
be learn i shall pass over in silenc the hoari tradit that
in the countri and mani a book still constitut the legend of the
hive whenev there be doubt disagr hypothesi when i
arriv at the unknown i shall declar it loyal you will find
that we often shall halt befor the unknown beyond the appreci
fact of their life we know but littl of the bee and the closer
our acquaint becom the nearer is our ignor brought to us
of the depth of their real exist but such ignor is better
than the other kind which is unconsci and satisfi
doe an analog work on the bee exist i believ i have read
almost all that ha been written on bee but of kindr matter i
know onli michelet chapter at the end of hi book the insect
and ludwig buchner essai in hi mind in anim michelet mere
hover on the fring of hi subject buchner treatis is
comprehens enough but contain so mani hazard statement so
much longdiscard gossip and hearsai that i suspect him of never
have left hi librari never have set forth himself to question
hi heroin or open on of the mani hundr of rustl
winglit hive which we must profan befor our instinct can be
attun to their secret befor we can perceiv the spirit and
atmospher perfum and mysteri of these virgin daughter of toil
the book smell not of the bee or it honei and ha the defect of
mani a learn work whose conclus often ar preconceiv and
whose scientif attain is compos of a vast arrai of doubt
anecdot collect on everi side but in thi essai of mine we
rare shall meet each other for our startingpoint our aim and
our point of view ar all veri differ

the bibliographi of the bee we will begin with the book so as to
get rid of them as soon as we can and go to the sourc of the book
is veri extens from the begin thi strang littl creatur
that live in a societi under complic law and execut
prodigi labour in the dark attract the notic of men
aristotl cato varro plini columella palladiu all studi the
bee to sai noth of aristomachu who accord to cicero
watch them for fiftyeight year and of phyliscu whose write
ar lost but these dealt rather with the legend of the bee and all
that we can gather therefromwhich inde is exceedingli littlew
mai find condens in the fourth book of virgil georgic
the real histori of the bee begin in the seventeenth centuri with
the discoveri of the great dutch savant swammerdam it is well
howev to add thi detail but littl known befor swammerdam a
flemish naturalist name clutiu had arriv at certain import
truth such as the sole matern of the queen and her possess
of the attribut of both sex but he had left these unprov
swammerdam found the true method of scientif investig he
invent the microscop contriv inject to ward off decai wa
the first to dissect the bee and by the discoveri of the ovari
and the oviduct definit fix the sex of the queen hitherto
look upon as a king and threw the whole polit scheme of the
hive into most unexpect light by base it upon matern final
he produc woodcut and engrav so perfect that to thi dai thei
serv to illustr mani book on apicultur he live in the
turbul restless amsterdam of those dai regret het zoet
buiten leve the sweet life of the countryand di wornout
with work at the ag of fortythre he wrote in a piou formal
style with beauti simpl outburst of a faith that fear of
fall awai ascrib all thing to the glori of the creator and
embodi hi observ and studi in hi great work bybel der
natuur which the doctor boerhav a centuri later caus to be
translat from the dutch into latin under the titl of biblia
natura leyden 1737
then came reaumur who pursu similar method made a vast number
of curiou experi and research in hi garden at charenton
and devot to the bee an entir volum of hi note to serv for
a histori of insect on mai read it with profit todai and
without fatigu it is clear direct and sincer and possess of
a certain hard arid charm of it own he sought especi the
destruct of ancient error he himself wa respons for
sever new on he partial understood the format of swarm
and the polit establish of queen in a word he discov
mani difficult truth and pave the wai for the discoveri of more
he fulli appreci the marvel architectur of the hive and
what he said on the subject ha never been better said it is to
him too that we ow the idea of the glass hive which have
sinc been perfect enabl us to follow the entir privat life of
these fierc insect whose work begun in the dazzl sunshin
receiv it crown in the dark to be comprehens on should
mention also the somewhat subsequ work and investig of
charl bonnet and schirach who solv the enigma of the royal
egg but i will keep to the broad line and pass at onc to
francoi huber the master and classic of contemporari apiarian
scienc
huber wa born in geneva in 1750 and fell blind in hi earliest
youth the experi of reaumur interest him he sought to
verifi them and soon becom passion absorb in these
research eventu with the assist of an intellig and
faith servant francoi burnen devot hi entir life to the
studi of the bee in the annal of human suffer and human triumph
there is noth more touch no lesson more admir than the
stori of thi patient collabor wherein the on who saw onli
with immateri light guid with hi spirit the ey and hand of
the other who had the real earthli vision where he who as we ar
assur had never with hi own ey beheld a comb of honei wa yet
abl notwithstand the veil on hi dead ey that render doubl
the veil in which natur enwrap all thing to penetr the
profound secret of the geniu that had made thi invis comb as
though to teach us that no condit in life can warrant our
abandon our desir and search for the truth i will not enumer
all that apiarian scienc ow to huber to state what it doe not
ow were the briefer task hi new observ on bee of which
the first volum wa written in 1789 in the form of letter to
charl bonnet the second not appear till twenti year later
have remain the unfail abund treasur into which everi
subsequ writer ha dip and though a few mistak mai be found
therein a few incomplet truth though sinc hi time consider
addit have been made to the micrographi and practic cultur of
bee the handl of queen etc there is not a singl on of hi
princip statement that ha been disprov or discov in
error and in our actual experi thei stand untouch and inde
at it veri foundat
3
some year of silenc follow these revel but soon a german
clergyman dzierzon discov parthenogenesi i e the
virgin parturit of queen and contriv the first hive with
movabl comb therebi enabl the beekeep henceforth to take
hi share of the harvest of honei without be forc to destroi
hi best coloni and in on instant annihil the work of an
entir year thi hive still veri imperfect receiv masterli
improv at the hand of langstroth who invent the movabl
frame properli so call which ha been adopt in america with
extraordinari success root quinbi dadant cheshir de layen
cowan heddon howard etc ad still further and preciou
improv then it occur to mehr that if bee were suppli
with comb that had an artifici waxen foundat thei would be
spare the labour of fashion the wax and construct the cell
which cost them much honei and the best part of their time he
found that the bee accept these comb most readili and adapt
them to their requir
major de hruschka invent the honeyextractor which enabl the
honei to be withdrawn by centrifug forc without break the
comb etc and thu in a few year the method of apicultur
underw a radic chang the capac and fruit of the
hive were trebl great and product apiari aros on everi
side an end wa put to the useless destruct of the most
industri citi and to the odiou select of the least fit
which wa it result man truli becam the master of the bee
although furtiv and without their knowledg direct all
thing without give an order receiv obedi but not
recognit for the destini onc impos by the season he ha
substitut hi will he repair the injustic of the year unit
hostil republ and equalis wealth he restrict or augment
the birth regul the fecund of the queen dethron her and
instal anoth in her place after dexter obtain the
reluct consent of a peopl who would be madden at the mere
suspicion of an inconceiv intervent when he think fit he
will peacefulli violat the secret of the sacr chamber and the
elabor tortuou polici of the palac he will five or six time
in success depriv the bee of the fruit of their labour without
harm them without their becom discourag or even
impoverish he proport the storehous and granari of their
dwell to the harvest of flower that the spring is spread
over the dip of the hill he compel them to reduc the extravag
number of lover who await the birth of the royal princess in a
word he doe with them what he will he obtain what he will
provid alwai that what he seek be in accord with their law
and their virtu for beyond all the desir of thi strang god
who ha taken possess of them who is too vast to be seen and too
alien to be understood their ey see further than the ey of the
god himself and their on thought is the accomplish with
untir sacrific of the mysteri duti of their race
4
let us now have learn from book all that thei had to teach us
of a veri ancient histori leav the scienc other have acquir
and look at the bee with our own ey an hour spent in the midst
of the apiari will be less instruct perhap but the thing we
shall see will be infinit more stimul and more actual
i have not yet forgotten the first apiari i saw where i learn to
love the bee it wa mani year ago in a larg villag of dutch
flander the sweet and pleasant countri whose love for brilliant
colour rival that of zealand even the concav mirror of holland a
countri that gladli spread out befor us as so mani pretti
thought toi her illumin gabl and waggon and tower
her cupboard and clock that gleam at the end of the passag her
littl tree marshal in line along quai and canalbank
wait on almost might think for some quiet benefic
ceremoni her boat and her barg with sculptur poop her
flowerlik door and window immacul dam and elabor
manycolour drawbridg and her littl varnish hous bright
as new potteri from which bellshap dame come forth all
aglitt with silver and gold to milk the cow in the whitehedg
field or spread the linen on floweri lawn cut into pattern of
oval and lozeng and most astoundingli green
to thi spot where life would seem more restrict than
elsewhereif it be possibl for life inde to becom restricteda
sort of ag philosoph had retir an old man somewhat akin to
virgil
man equal to king and approach the god
whereto lafontain might have ad
and like the god content and at rest
here had he built hi refug be a littl weari not disgust
for the larg avers ar unknown to the sage but a littl weari
of interrog men whose answer to the onli interest
question on can put concern natur and her verit law ar
far less simpl than those that ar given by anim and plant hi
happi like the scythian philosoph lai all in the beauti
of hi garden and bestlov and visit most often wa the
apiari compos of twelv dome of straw some of which he had
paint a bright pink and some a clear yellow but most of all a
tender blue have notic long befor sir john lubbock
demonstr the bee fond for thi colour
these hive stood against the wall of the hous in the angl form
by on of those pleasant and grace dutch kitchen whose
earthenwar dresser all bright with copper and tin reflect
itself through the open door on to the peac canal and the
water burden with these familiar imag beneath it curtain of
poplar led on ey to a calm horizon of mill and of meadow
here as in all place the hive lent a new mean to the flower
and the silenc the balm of the air and the rai of the sun on
seem to have drawn veri near to the festiv spirit of natur on
wa content to rest at thi radiant crossroad where the aerial wai
converg and divid that the busi and tune bearer of all countri
perfum unceasingli travel from dawn unto dusk on heard the
music voic of the garden whose loveliest hour reveal their
rejoic soul and sang of their glad on came hither to the
school of the bee to be taught the preoccup of allpow
natur the harmoni concord of the three kingdom the
indefatig organis of life and the lesson of ardent and
disinterest work and anoth lesson too with a moral as good
that the heroic worker taught there and emphasis as it were
with the fieri dart of their myriad wing wa to appreci the
somewhat vagu savour of leisur to enjoi the almost unspeak
delight of those immacul dai that revolv on themselv in the
field of space form mere a transpar globe as void of
memori as the happi without alloi
5
in order to follow as simpli as possibl the life of the bee
through the year we will take a hive that awak in the spring and
duli start on it labour and then we shall meet in their natur
order all the great episod viz the format and departur of
the swarm the foundat of the new citi the birth combat and
nuptial flight of the young queen the massacr of the male and
final the return of the sleep of winter with each of these
episod there will go the necessari explan as to the law
habit peculiar and event that produc and accompani it so
that when arriv at the end of the bee short year which extend
onli from april to the last dai of septemb we shall have gaze
upon all the mysteri of the palac of honei befor we open it
therefor and throw a gener glanc around we onli need sai that
the hive is compos of a queen the mother of all her peopl of
thousand of worker or neuter who ar incomplet and steril
femal and lastli of some hundr of male from whom on shall
be chosen as the sole and unfortun consort of the queen that the
worker will elect in the futur after the more or less voluntari
departur of the reign mother
6
the first time that we open a hive there come over us an emot
akin to that we might feel at profan some unknown object charg
perhap with dread surpris as a tomb a legend of menac and
peril still cling to the bee there is the distress
recollect of her sting which produc a pain so characterist
that on know not wherewith to compar it a kind of destroi
dryness a flame of the desert rush over the wound limb as
though these daughter of the sun had distil a dazzl poison
from their father angri rai in order more effect to defend
the treasur thei gather from hi benefic hour
it is true that were some on who neither know nor respect the
custom and charact of the bee suddenli to fling open the hive it
would turn at onc into a burn bush of heroism and anger but the
slight amount of skill need to handl it with impun can be most
readili acquir let but a littl smoke be deftli appli much
cool and gentl be shown and our wellarm worker will
suffer themselv to be despoil without dream of draw their
sting it is not the fact as some have maintain that the bee
recognis their master nor have thei ani fear of man but at the
smell of the smoke at the larg slow gestur that travers their
dwell without threaten them thei imagin that thi is not
the attack of an enemi against whom defenc is possibl but that it
is a forc or a natur catastroph whereto thei do well to submit
instead of vainli struggl therefor thei do what thei can to
safeguard the futur and obei a foresight that for onc is in
error thei fly to their reserv of honei into which thei eagerli
dip in order to possess within themselv the wherewith to start a
new citi immedi and no matter where should the ancient on be
destroi or thei be compel to forsak it
7
the first impress of the novic befor whom an observationh
is open will be on of some disappoint he had been told that
thi littl glass case contain an unparallel activ an
infinit number of wise law and a startl amalgam of mysteri
experi geniu calcul scienc of variou industri of
certitud and prescienc of intellig habit and curiou feel
and virtu all that he see is a confus mass of littl reddish
group somewhat resembl roast coffeeberri or bunch of
raisin pile against the glass thei look more dead than aliv
their movement ar slow incoher and incomprehens can
these be the wonder drop of light he had seen but a moment ago
unceasingli flash and sparkl as thei dart among the pearl
and the gold of a thousand wideopen calyc
by observationh is meant a hive of glass furnish with black
curtain or shutter the best kind have onli on comb thu
permit both face to be studi these hive can be place in a
drawingroom librari etc without inconveni or danger the
bee that inhabit the on i have in my studi in pari ar abl even
in the stoni desert of that great citi to find the wherewith to
nourish themselv and to prosper
thei appear to be shiver in the dark to be numb
suffoc so close ar thei huddl togeth on might fanci
thei were ail captiv or queen dethron who have had their
on moment of glori in the midst of their radiant garden and ar
now compel to return to the shame squalor of their poor
overcrowd home
it is with them as with all that is deepli real thei must be
studi and on must learn how to studi them the inhabit of
anoth planet who should see men and women come and go almost
impercept through our street crowd at certain time around
certain build or wait for on know not what without
appar movement in the depth of their dwell might conclud
therefrom that thei too were miser and inert it take time to
distinguish the manifold activ contain in thi inertia
and inde everi on of the littl almost motionless group in the
hive is incessantli work each at a differ trade repos is
unknown to ani and such for instanc as seem the most torpid as
thei hang in dead cluster against the glass ar intrust with the
most mysteri and fatigu task of all it is thei who secret
and form the wax but the detail of thi univers activ will be
given in their place for the moment we need onli call attent to
the essenti trait in the natur of the bee which account for the
extraordinari agglomer of the variou worker the bee is abov
all and even to a greater extent than the ant a creatur of the
crowd she can live onli in the midst of a multitud when she
leav the hive which is so dens pack that she ha to forc
her wai with blow of her head through the live wall that enclos
her she depart from her proper element she will dive for an
instant into flowerfil space as the swimmer will dive into the
sea that is fill with pearl but under pain of death it behov
her at regular interv to return and breath the crowd as the
swimmer must return and breath the air isol her and howev
abund the food or favour the temperatur she will expir in
a few dai not of hunger or cold but of loneli from the crowd
from the citi she deriv an invis aliment that is as necessari
to her as honei thi crave will help to explain the spirit of the
law of the hive for in them the individu is noth her
exist condit onli and herself for on indiffer moment
a wing organ of the race her whole life is an entir sacrific to
the manifold everlast be whereof she form part it is
strang to note that it wa not alwai so we find even todai
among the mellifer hymenoptera all the stage of progress
civilis of our own domest bee at the bottom of the scale we
find her work alon in wretched often not see her
offspr the prosopi the collet etc sometim live in
the midst of the limit famili that she produc annual as in
the case of the humblebe then she form temporari associ the
panurgi the dasypodo the hacliti etc and at last we arriv
through success stage at the almost perfect but pitiless societi of
our hive where the individu is entir merg in the republ and
the republ in it turn invari sacrif to the abstract and
immort citi of the futur
8
let us not too hastili deduc from these fact conclus that
appli to man he possess the power of withstand certain of
natur law and to know whether such resist be right or wrong
is the gravest and obscurest point in hi moral but it is deepli
interest to discov what the will of natur mai be in a
differ world and thi will is reveal with extraordinari
clear in the evolut of the hymenoptera which of all the
inhabit of thi globe possess the highest degre of intellect
after that of man the aim of natur is manifestli the improv
of the race but no less manifest is her inabl or refus to
obtain such improv except at the cost of the liberti the
right and the happi of the individu in proport as a
societi organis itself and rise in the scale so doe a
shrinkag enter the privat life of each on of it member where
there is progress it is the result onli of a more and more complet
sacrific of the individu to the gener interest each on is
compel first of all to renounc hi vice which ar act of
independ for instanc at the last stage but on of apiarian
civilis we find the humblebe which ar like our cannib
the adult worker ar incessantli hover around the egg which
thei seek to devour and the mother ha to displai the utmost
stubborn in their defenc then have freed himself from hi
most danger vice each individu ha to acquir a certain
number of more and more pain virtu among the humblebe for
instanc the worker do not dream of renounc love wherea our
domest bee live in a state of perpetu chastiti and inde we
soon shall show how much more she ha to abandon in exchang for
the comfort and secur of the hive for it architectur
econom and polit perfect and we shall return to the
evolut of the hymenoptera in the chapter devot to the progress
of the speci
ii the swarm
9
we will now so as to draw more close to natur consid the
differ episod of the swarm as thei come to pass in an ordinari
hive which is ten or twenti time more popul than an observ
on and leav the bee entir free and untrammel
here then thei have shaken off the torpor of winter the queen
start lai again in the veri first dai of februari and the
worker have flock to the willow and nuttre gors and
violet anemon and lungwort then spring invad the earth and
cellar and stream with honei and pollen while each dai behold the
birth of thousand of bee the overgrown male now all salli forth
from their cell and disport themselv on the comb and so
crowd doe the too prosper citi becom that hundr of belat
worker come back from the flower toward even will vainli
seek shelter within and will be forc to spend the night on the
threshold where thei will be decim by the cold restless
seiz the peopl and the old queen begin to stir she feel that
a new destini is be prepar she ha religi fulfil her
duti as a good creatress and from thi duti done there result onli
tribul and sorrow an invinc power menac her
tranquil she will soon be forc to quit thi citi of her
where she ha reign but thi citi is her work it is she
herself she is not it queen in the sens in which men us the
word she issu no order she obei as meekli as the humblest of
her subject the mask power sovereignli wise that for the
present and till we attempt to locat it we will term the spirit
of the hive but she is the uniqu organ of love she is the mother
of the citi she found it amid uncertainti and poverti she ha
peopl it with her own substanc and all who move within it
wallswork male larva nymph and the young princess
whose approach birth will hasten her own departur on of them
be alreadi design as her successor by the spirit of the
hiveal these have issu from her flank
10
what is thi spirit of the hivewher doe it resid it is not
like the special instinct that teach the bird to construct it
well plan nest and then seek other ski when the dai for
migrat return nor is it a kind of mechan habit of the race
or blind crave for life that will fling the bee upon ani wild
hazard the moment an unforeseen event shall derang the accustom
order of phenomena on the contrari be the event never so
master the spirit of the hive still will follow it step by
step like an alert and quickwit slave who is abl to deriv
advantag even from hi master most danger order
it dispos pitilessli of the wealth and the happi the liberti
and life of all thi wing peopl and yet with discret as
though govern itself by some great duti it regul dai by dai
the number of birth and contriv that these shall strictli accord
with the number of flower that brighten the countrysid it
decre the queen deposit or warn her that she must depart it
compel her to bring her own rival into the world and rear them
royal protect them from their mother polit hatr so
too in accord with the generos of the flower the ag of
the spring and the probabl danger of the nuptial flight will it
permit or forbid the firstborn of the virgin princess to slai in
their cradl her younger sister who ar sing the song of the
queen at other time when the season wane and floweri hour
grow shorter it will command the worker themselv to slaughter
the whole imperi brood that the era of revolut mai close and
work becom the sole object of all the spirit of the hive is
prudent and thrifti but by no mean parsimoni and thu awar
it would seem that natur law ar somewhat wild and extravag
in all that pertain to love it toler dure summer dai of
abund the embarrass presenc in the hive of three or four
hundr male from whose rank the queen about to be born shall
select her lover three or four hundr foolish clumsi useless
noisi creatur who ar pretenti glutton dirti coars
total and scandal idl insati and enorm
but after the queen impregn when flower begin to close
sooner and open later the spirit on morn will coldli decre
the simultan and gener massacr of everi male it regul
the worker labour with due regard to their ag it allot their
task to the nurs who tend the nymph and the larva the ladi of
honour who wait on the queen and never allow her out of their sight
the housebe who air refresh or heat the hive by fan their
wing and hasten the evapor of the honei that mai be too
highli charg with water the architect mason waxwork and
sculptor who form the chain and construct the comb the forag
who salli forth to the flower in search of the nectar that turn
into honei of the pollen that feed the nymph and the larva the

the water and salt requir by the youth of the nation it order
have gone to the chemist who ensur the preserv of the honei

goer recognis the novic who return from their veri first
flight scare awai vagabond maraud and loiter expel all
intrud attack redoubt foe in a bodi and if need be
barricad the entranc
final it is the spirit of the hive that fix the hour of the
great annual sacrific to the geniu of the race the hour that is
of the swarm when we find a whole peopl who have attain the
topmost pinnacl of prosper and power suddenli abandon to the
gener to come their wealth and their palac their home and
the fruit of their labour themselv content to encount the
hardship and peril of a new and distant countri thi act be it
consciou or not undoubtedli pass the limit of human moral
it result will sometim be ruin but poverti alwai and the
thricehappi citi is scatter abroad in obedi to a law superior
to it own happi where ha thi law been decre which as we
soon shall find is by no mean as blind and inevit as on might
believ where in what assembl what council what intellectu
and moral sphere doe thi spirit resid to whom all must submit
itself be vassal to an heroic duti to an intellig whose ey
ar persist fix on the futur
it come to pass with the bee as with most of the thing in thi
world we remark some few of their habit we sai thei do thi thei
work in such and such fashion their queen ar born thu their
worker ar virgin thei swarm at a certain time and then we
imagin we know them and ask noth more we watch them hasten
from flower to flower we see the constant agit within the
hive their life seem veri simpl to us and bound like everi
life by the instinct care of reproduct and nourish but
let the ey draw near and endeavour to see and at onc the least
phenomenon of all becom overpoweringli complex we ar confront
by the enigma of intellect of destini will aim mean caus
the incomprehens organis of the most insignific act of
life
11
our hive then is prepar to swarm make readi for the great
immol to the exact god of the race in obedi to
the order of the spiritan order that to us mai well seem
incomprehens for it is entir oppos to all our own
instinct and feelings60000 or 70000 bee out of the 80000 or
90000 that form the whole popul will abandon the matern
citi at the prescrib hour thei will not leav at a moment of
despair or desert with sudden and wild resolv a home laid wast
by famin diseas or war no the exil ha long been plan and
the favour hour patient await were the hive poor had it
suffer from pillag or storm had misfortun befallen the royal
famili the bee would not forsak it thei leav it onli when it

will render them sourc of danger to all the littl republ

all thing go to prove that it is not the queen but the spirit of
the hive that decid on the swarm with thi queen of our it

more inexplic than those he issu to hi subordin the

noth of the manner in which the spirit convei it resolut to
the crowd certain as it mai seem that the bee commun with
each other we know not whether thi be done in human fashion it is
possibl even that their own refrain mai be inaud to them the
murmur that come to us heavili laden with perfum of honei the
ecstat whisper of fairest summer dai that the beekeep love so
well the festiv song of labour that rise and fall around the
hive in the crystal of the hour and might almost be the chant of
the eager flower hymn of their glad and echo of their soft
fragranc the voic of the white carnat the marjoram and the
thyme thei have howev a whole gamut of sound that we can
distinguish rang from profound delight to menac distress and
anger thei have the od of the queen the song of abund the
psalm of grief and lastli the long and mysteri warcri the
adolesc princess send forth dure the combat and massacr
that preced the nuptial flight mai thi be a fortuit music that
fail to attain their inward silenc in ani event thei seem not the
least disturb at the nois we make near the hive but thei regard
these perhap as not of their world and possess of no interest
for them it is possibl that we on our side hear onli a fraction
part of the sound that the bee produc and that thei have mani
harmoni to which our ear ar not attun we soon shall see with
what startl rapid thei ar abl to understand each other and
adopt concert measur when for instanc the great honei thief
the huge sphinx atropo the sinist butterfli that bear a death
head on it back penetr into the hive hum it own strang
note which act as a kind of irresist incant the new

14
it wa for a long time believ that when these wise bee gener
so prudent so farsight and econom abandon the treasur
of their kingdom and flung themselv upon the uncertainti of
life thei were yield to a kind of irresist folli a
mechan impuls a law of the speci a decre of natur or to
the forc that for all creatur li hidden in the revolut of
time it is our habit in the case of the bee no less than our own
to regard as fatal all that we do not as yet understand but now
that the hive ha surrend two or three of it materi secret
we have discov that thi exodu is neither instinct nor
inevit it is not a blind emigr but appar the
wellconsid sacrific of the present gener in favour of the
gener to come the beekeep ha onli to destroi in their
cell the young queen that still ar inert and at the same time
if nymph and larva abound to enlarg the storehous and
dormitori of the nation for thi unprofit tumult
instantan to subsid for work to be at onc resum and the
flower revisit while the old queen who now is essenti again
with no successor to hope for or perhap to fear will renounc for
thi year her desir for the light of the sun reassur as to the
futur of the activ that will soon spring into life she will
tranquilli resum her matern labour which consist in the lai
of two or three thousand egg a dai as she pass in a method
spiral from cell to cell omit none and never paus to rest
where is the fatal here save in the love of the race of todai
for the race of tomorrow thi fatal exist in the human speci
also but it extent and power seem infinit less among men it
never give rise to sacrific as great as unanim or as
complet what farse fatal take the place of thi on do
we ourselv obei we know not as we know not the be who watch
us as we watch the bee
but the hive that we have select is disturb in it histori by no
interfer of man and as the beauti dai advanc with radiant
and tranquil step beneath the tree it ardour still bath in
dew make the appoint hour seem laggard over the whole surfac
of the golden corridor that divid the parallel wall the worker
ar busili make prepar for the journei and each on will
first of all burden herself with provis of honei suffici for
five or six dai from thi honei that thei bear within them thei
will distil by a chemic process still unexplain the wax
requir for the immedi construct of build thei will
provid themselv also with a certain amount of propoli a kind of
resin with which thei will seal all the crevic in the new
dwell strengthen weak place varnish the wall and exclud the
light for the bee love to work in almost total obscur guid
themselv with their manyfacet ey or with their antenna
perhap the seat it would seem of an unknown sens that fathom
and measur the dark
16
thei ar not without prescienc therefor of what is to befal
them on thi the most danger dai of all their exist absorb
by the care the prodigi peril of thi mighti adventur thei
will have no time now to visit the garden and meadow and
tomorrow and after tomorrow it mai happen that rain mai fall or
there mai be wind that their wing mai be frozen or the flower
refus to open famin and death would await them were it not for
thi foresight of their none would come to their help nor would
thei seek help of ani for on citi know not the other and
assist never is given and even though the beekeep deposit
the hive in which he ha gather the old queen and her attend
cluster of bee by the side of the abod thei have but thi moment
quit thei would seem be the disast never so great that shall
now have befallen them to have wholli forgotten the peac and the
happi activ that onc thei had known there the abund wealth
and the safeti that had then been their portion and all on by
on and down to the last of them will perish of hunger and cold
around their unfortun queen rather than return to the home of
their birth whose sweet odour of plenti the fragranc inde of
their own past assidu labour reach them even in their
distress
17
that is a thing some will sai that men would not doa proof that
the bee notwithstand the marvel of it organis still is
lack in intellect and verit conscious is thi so
certain other be sure mai possess an intellect that differ
from our and produc differ result without therefor be
inferior and besid ar we even in thi littl human parish of
our such infal judg of matter that pertain to the spirit
can we so readili divin the thought that mai govern the two or
three peopl we mai chanc to see move and talk behind a close
window when their word do not reach us or let us suppos that an
inhabit of venu or mar were to contempl us from the height
of a mountain and watch the littl black speck that we form in
space as we come and go in the street and squar of our town
would the mere sight of our movement our build machin and
canal convei to him ani precis idea of our moral intellect
our manner of think and love and hopingin a word of our
real and intim self all he could do like ourselv when we gaze
at the hive would be to take note of some fact that seem veri
surpris and from these fact to deduc conclus probabl no
less erron no less uncertain than those that we choos to form
concern the bee
thi much at least is certain our littl black speck would not
reveal the vast moral direct the wonder uniti that ar so
appar in the hive whither do thei tend and what is it thei do
he would ask after year and centuri of patient watch what
is the aim of their life or it pivot do thei obei some god i can

know not what it is thei seek in numberless case the spectacl
thei present is altogeth inexplic there ar some for

by their more consider bulk thei occupi build ten or twenti

can onli assum that these person must be indispens to the

natur of thi servic mai be there ar other again who ar

18
is it not strang that the hive which we vagu survei from the
height of anoth world should provid our first question glanc
with so sure and profound a repli must we not admir the manner in
which the thought or the god that the bee obei is at onc reveal
by their edific wrought with such strike convict by their
custom and law their polit and econom organis their
virtu and even their cruelti nor is thi god though it be
perhap the onli on to which man ha as yet never offer seriou
worship by ani mean the least reason or the least legitim
that we can conceiv the god of the bee is the futur when we in
our studi of human histori endeavour to gaug the moral forc or
great of a peopl or race we have but on standard of
measurementth digniti and perman of their ideal and the
abneg wherewith thei pursu it have we often encount an
ideal more conform to the desir of the univers more wide

there ar numberless instanc of the absolut attach and
devot that the worker displai toward their queen should

collaps should man prove ignor or brutal should thei suffer

their young and their food you still shall never succe in make

disastr moment and thereupon will immedi reassum their
labour with an ardour a patienc a tenac and intellig not
often to be found exist to such a degre in natur true though
it be that most of it creatur displai more confid and courag
than man
but the presenc of the queen is not even essenti for their
discourag to vanish and their love to endur it is enough that
she should have left at the moment of her death or departur the
veri slenderest hope of descend we have seen a coloni sai
langstroth on of the father of modern apicultur that had not
bee suffici to cover a comb of three inch squar and yet
endeavour to rear a queen for two whole week did thei cherish
thi hope final when their number wa reduc by onehalf their
queen wa born but her wing were imperfect and she wa unabl to

respect a week more and there remain hardli a dozen bee yet a
few dai and the queen had vanish leav a few wretch
inconsol insect upon the comb
there is anoth instanc and on that reveal most palpabl the
ultim gestur of filial love and devot it aris from on of
the extraordinari ordeal that our recent and tyrann
intervent inflict on these hapless unflinch heroin i in
common with all amateur beekeep have more than onc had
impregn queen sent me from itali for the italian speci is
more prolif stronger more activ and gentler than our own it
is the custom to forward them in small perfor box in these
some food is place and the queen enclos togeth with a certain
number of worker select as far as possibl from among the oldest

the act of present the last drop of honei she held in her sac to
the queen who wa symbol of a life more preciou more vast than

28
thi unwav affect have come under the notic of man he

the hive in accord with the manner in which he deal with
hera it were plai with herh can increas and hasten the
swarm or restrict and retard it he can unit or divid coloni
and direct the emigr of kingdom and yet it is none the less
true that the queen is essenti mere a sort of live symbol
stand as all symbol must for a vaster although less
percept principl and thi principl the apiarist will do well
to take into account if he would not expos himself to more than
on unexpect revers for the bee ar by no mean delud the
presenc of the queen doe not blind them to the exist of their
verit sovereign immateri and everlast which is no other
than their fix idea why inquir as to whether thi idea be
consciou or not such specul can have valu onli if our
anxieti be to determin whether we should more rightli admir the
bee that have the idea or natur that ha plant it in them
wherev it lodg in the vast unknow bodi or in the tini on
that we see it merit our deepest attent nor mai it be out of
place here to observ that it is the habit we have of subordin
our wonder to accid of origin or place that so often caus us
to lose the chanc of deep admir which of all thing in the
world is the most help to us
29
these conjectur mai perhap be regard as exceedingli
venturesom and possibl also as unduli human it mai be urg that
the bee in all probabl have no idea of the kind that their
care for the futur love of the race and mani other feel we
choos to ascrib to them ar truli no more than form assum by
the necess of life the fear of suffer or death and the
attract of pleasur let it be so look on it all as a figur of
speech it is a matter to which i attach no import the on
thing certain here as it is the on thing certain in all other
case is that under special circumst the bee will treat
their queen in a special manner the rest is all mysteri around
which we onli can weav more or less ingeni and pleasant
conjectur and yet were we speak of man in the manner wherein
it were wise perhap to speak of the bee is there veri much more we
could sai he too yield onli to necess the attract of
pleasur and the fear of suffer and what we call our intellect
ha the same origin and mission as what in anim we choos to term
instinct we do certain thing whose result we conceiv to be
known to us other thing happen and we flatter ourselv that we
ar better equip than anim can be to divin their caus but
apart from the fact that thi supposit rest on no veri solid
foundat event of thi natur ar rare and infinitesim
compar with the vast mass of other that elud comprehens and
all the pettiest and the most sublim the best known and the most
inexplic the nearest and the most distant come to pass in a
night so profound that our blind mai well be almost as great as
that we suppos in the bee
30
all must agre remark buffon who ha a somewhat amus
prejudic against the beeall must agre that these fli
individu consid possess far less geniu than the dog the
monkei or the major of anim that thei displai far less
docil attach or sentiment that thei have in a word less
qualiti that relat to our own and from that we mai conclud that
their appar intellig deriv onli from their assembl
multitud nor doe thi union even argu intellig for it is
govern by no moral consider it be without their consent
that thei find themselv gather togeth thi societi
therefor is no more than a physic assemblag ordain by natur
and independ either of knowledg or reason or aim the
motherbe produc ten thousand individu at a time and in the
same place these ten thousand individu were thei a thousand
time stupid than i suppos them to be would be compel for
the mere purpos of exist to contriv some form of arrang
and assum that thei had begun by injur each other thei
would as each on possess the same strength as it fellow soon
have end by do each other the least possibl harm or in other
word by render assist thei have the appear of
understand each other and of work for a common aim and the
observ therefor is apt to endow them with reason and intellect
that thei truli ar far from possess he will pretend to account
for each action show a reason behind everi movement and from
thenc the gradat is easi to proclaim them marvel or
monster of innumer idea wherea the truth is that these ten
thousand individu that have been produc simultan that
have live togeth and undergon metamorphosi at more or less the
same time cannot fail all to do the same thing and ar compel
howev slight the sentiment within them to adopt common habit to
live in accord and union to busi themselv with their dwell to
return to it after their journei etc etc and on thi foundat
aris the architectur the geometri the order the foresight love
of countryin a word the republ all spring as we have
seen from the admir of the observ there we have our bee
explain in a veri differ fashion and if it seem more natur
at first is it not for the veri simpl reason that it realli
explain almost noth i will not allud to the materi error
thi chapter contain i will onli ask whether the mere fact of the
bee accept a common exist while do each other the least
possibl harm doe not in itself argu a certain intellig and
doe not thi intellig appear the more remark to us as we
more close examin the fashion in which these ten thousand
individu avoid hurt each other and end by give assist
and further is thi not the histori of ourselv and doe not all
that the angri old naturalist sai appli equal to everi on of our
human societi and yet onc again if the bee is inde to be
credit with none of the feel or idea that we have ascrib to
it shall we not veri willingli shift the ground of our wonder if
we must not admir the bee we will then admir natur the moment
must alwai come when admir can be no longer deni us nor
shall there be loss to us through our have retreat or wait
howev these thing mai be and without abandon thi conjectur
of our that at least ha the advantag of connect in our mind
certain action that have evid connect in fact it is certain
that the bee have far less ador for the queen herself than for
the infinit futur of the race that she repres thei ar not
sentiment and should on of their number return from work so
sever wound as to be held incap of further servic thei
will ruthlessli expel her from the hive and yet it cannot be said
that thei ar altogeth incap of a kind of person attach
toward their mother thei will recognis her from among all even
when she is old crippl and wretch the sentinel at the door
will never allow anoth queen to enter the hive though she be
young and fruit it is true that thi is on of the fundament
principl of their politi and never relax except at time of
abund honei in favour of some foreign worker who shall be well
laden with food
when the queen ha becom complet steril the bee will rear a
certain number of royal princess to fill her place but what
becom of the old sovereign as to thi we have no precis
knowledg but it ha happen at time that apiarist have found
a magnific queen in the flower of her ag on the central comb
of the hive and in some obscur corner right at the back the
gaunt decrepit old mistress as thei call her in normandi in
such case it would seem that the bee have to exercis the greatest
care to protect her from the hatr of the vigor rival who long
for her death for queen hate queen so fierc that two who might
happen to be under the same roof would immedi fly at each
other it would be pleasant to believ that the bee ar thu
provid their ancient sovereign with a humbl shelter in a remot
corner of the citi where she mai end her dai in peac here again
we touch on of the thousand enigma of the waxen citi and it is
onc more prove to us that the habit and the polici of the bee
ar by no mean narrow or rigidli predetermin and that their
action have motiv far more complex than we ar inclin to
suppos
32
but we ar constantli tamper with what thei must regard as
immov law of natur constantli place the bee in a posit
that mai be compar to that in which we should ourselv be place
were the law of space and graviti of light and heat to be
suddenli suppress around us what ar the bee to do when we by
forc or by fraud introduc a second queen into the citi it is
probabl that in a state of natur thank to the sentinel at the
gate such an event ha never occur sinc thei first came into
the world but thi prodigi conjunctur doe not scatter their
wit thei still contriv to reconcil the two principl that thei
appear to regard in the light of divin command the first is that
of uniqu matern never infring except in the case of steril
in the reign queen and even then onli veri exception the
second is more curiou still and although never transgress
suscept of what mai almost be term a judaic evas it is the
law that invest the person of a queen whoever she be with a sort
of inviol it would be a simpl matter for the bee to pierc
the intrud with their myriad envenom sting she would die on
the spot and thei would mere have to remov the corps from the
hive but though thi sting is alwai held readi to strike though
thei make constant us of it in their fight among themselv thei
will never draw it against a queen nor will a queen ever draw her
on a man an anim or an ordinari bee she will never unsheath her
royal weaponcurv in scimet fashion instead of be
straight like that of the ordinari beesav onli in the case of
her do battl with an equal in other word with a sister queen
no bee it would seem dare take on herself the horror of direct and
bloodi regicid whenev therefor the good order and prosper
of the republ appear to demand that a queen shall die thei
endeavour to give to her death some semblanc of natur deceas
and by infinit subdivis of the crime to render it almost
anonym
thei will therefor to us the picturesqu express of the
apiarist ball the queenli intrud in other word thei will
entir surround her with their innumer interlac bodi thei
will thu form a sort of live prison wherein the captiv is unabl
to move and in thi prison thei will keep her for twentyfour
hour if need be till the victim die of suffoc or hunger
but if at thi moment the legitim queen draw near and
scent a rival appear dispos to attack her the live wall of
the prison will at onc fly open and the bee form a circl
around the two enemi will eagerli watch the strang duel that
will ensu though remain strictli imparti and take no share
in it for it is written that against a mother the sting mai be
drawn by a mother alon onli she who bear in her flank close on
two million live appear to possess the right with on blow to
inflict close on two million death
but if the combat last too long without ani result if the circular
weapon glide harmlessli over the heavi cuirass if on of the
queen appear anxiou to make her escap then be she the
legitim sovereign or be she the stranger she will at onc be
seiz and lodg in the live prison until such time as she
manifest onc more the desir to attack her foe it is right to add
howev that the numer experi that have been made on thi
subject have almost invari result in the victori of the
reign queen ow perhap to the extra courag and ardour she
deriv from the knowledg that she is at home with her subject
around her or to the fact that the bee howev imparti while
the fight is in progress mai possibl displai some favourit in
their manner of imprison the rival for their mother would seem
scarc to suffer from the confin wherea the stranger almost
alwai emerg in an appreci bruis and enfeebl condit
33
there is on simpl experi which prove the readi with which
the bee will recognis their queen and the depth of the attach
thei bear her remov her from the hive and there will soon be
manifest all the phenomena of anguish and distress that i have
describ in a preced chapter replac her a few hour later
and all her daughter will hasten toward her offer honei on
section will form a lane for her to pass through other with head
bent low and abdomen high in the air will describ befor her great
semicircl throb with sound hymn doubtless the chant of
welcom their rite dictat for moment of suprem happi or
solemn respect
but let it not be imagin that a foreign queen mai with impun be
substitut for the legitim mother the bee will at onc detect
the impostur the intrud will be seiz and immedi enclos
in the terribl tumultu prison whose obstin wall will be
reliev as it were till she di for in thi particular instanc
it hardli ever occur that the stranger emerg aliv
and here it is curiou to note to what diplomaci and elabor
stratagem man is compel to resort in order to delud these littl
sagaci insect and bend them to hi will in their unswerv
loyalti thei will accept the most unexpect event with touch
courag regard them probabl as some new and inevit fatal
capric of natur and inde all thi diplomaci notwithstand
in the desper confus that mai follow on of these hazard
expedi it is on the admir good sens of the bee that man
alwai and almost empir reli on the inexhaust
treasur of their marvel law and custom on their love of
peac and order their devot to the public weal and fidel to
the futur on the adroit strength the earnest disinterested
of their charact and abov all on the untir devot with
which thei fulfil their duti but the enumer of such procedur
belong rather to technic treatis on apicultur and would take
us too far
the stranger queen is usual brought into the hive
enclos in a littl cage with iron wire which is hung
between two comb the cage ha a door made of wax and
honei which the worker their anger over proce to gnaw
thu free the prison whom thei will often receiv
without ani illwil mr simmin manag of the great
apiari at rottingdean ha recent discov anoth
method of introduc a queen which be extrem simpl
and almost invari success bid fair to be gener
adopt by apiarist who valu their art it is the
behaviour of the queen that usual make her introduct a
matter of so great difficulti she is almost distract
fli to and fro hide and gener comport herself as
an intrud thu arous the suspicion of the bee which
ar soon confirm by the worker examin mr simmin
at first complet isol the queen he intend to
introduc and let her fast for half an hour he then lift
a corner of the inner cover of the orphan hive and place
the strang queen on the top of on of the comb her former
isol have terrifi her she is delight to find
herself in the midst of the bee and be famish she
eagerli accept the food thei offer her the worker
deceiv by her assur do not examin her but probabl
imagin that their old queen ha return and welcom her
joyfulli it would seem therefor that contrari to the
opinion of huber and all other investig the bee ar
not capabl of recognis their queen in ani event the
two explan which ar both equal plausiblethough
the truth mai lurk perhap in a third that is not yet
known to usonli prove onc again how complex and obscur
is the psycholog of the bee and from thi as from all
question that deal with life we can draw on conclus
onli that till better obtain curios still must rule in
our heart
34
as regard thi person affect of which we have spoken there is
on word more to be said that such affect exist is certain but
it is certain also that it memori is exceedingli shortliv dare
to replac in her kingdom a mother whose exil ha last some dai
and her indign daughter will receiv her in such a fashion as to
compel you hastili to snatch her from the deadli imprison
reserv for unknown queen for the bee have had time to transform
a dozen worker habit into royal cell and the futur of the
race is no longer in danger their affect will increas or
dwindl in the degre that the queen repres the futur thu we
often find when a virgin queen is perform the peril ceremoni
known as the nuptial flight of which i will speak later that her
subject ar so fear of lose her that thei will all accompani
her on thi tragic and distant quest of love thi thei will never
do howev if thei be provid with a fragment of comb contain
broodcel whenc thei shall be abl to rear other queen inde
their affect even mai turn into furi and hatr should their
sovereign fail in her duti to that sort of abstract divin that we
should call futur societi which the bee would appear to regard
far more serious than we it happen for instanc at time that
apiarist for variou reason will prevent the queen from join a
swarm by insert a trelli into the hive the nimbl and slender
worker will flit through it unperceiv but to the poor slave of
love heavier and more corpul than her daughter it offer an
impass barrier the bee when thei find that the queen ha not
follow will return to the hive and scold the unfortun
prison hustl and illtreat her accus her of lazi
probabl or suspect her of feebl mind on their second
departur when thei find that she still ha not follow her
illfaith becom evid to them and their attack grow more
seriou and final when thei shall have gone forth onc more and
still with the same result thei will almost alwai condemn her as
be irremedi faithless to her destini and to the futur of the
race and put her to death in the royal prison
35
it is to the futur therefor that the bee subordin all
thing and with a foresight a harmoni cooper a skill in
interpret event and turn them to the best advantag that
must compel our heartiest admir particularli when we rememb
in how startl and supernatur a light our recent intervent
must present itself to them it mai be said perhap that in the
last instanc we have given thei place a veri fals construct
upon the queen inabl to follow them but would our power of
discern be so veri much subtler if an intellig of an order
entir differ from our own and serv by a bodi so coloss
that it movement were almost as impercept as those of a
natur phenomenon were to divert itself by lai trap of thi
kind for us ha it not taken us thousand of year to invent a
suffici plausibl explan for the thunderbolt there is a
certain feebl that overwhelm everi intellect the moment it
emerg from it own sphere and is brought face to face with event
not of it own initi and besid it is quit possibl that
if thi ordeal of the trelli were to obtain more regularli and
gener among the bee thei would end by detect the pitfal
and by take step to elud it thei have master the intricaci
of the movabl comb of the section that compel them to store their
surplu honei in littl box symmetr pile and in the case
of the still more extraordinari innov of foundat wax where
the cell ar indic onli by a slender circumfer of wax thei
ar abl at onc to grasp the advantag thi new system present
thei most carefulli extend the wax and thu without loss of time
or labour construct perfect cell so long as the event that
confront them appear not a snare devis by some cun and
malici god the bee mai be trust alwai to discov the best
nai the onli human solut let me cite an instanc an event
that though occur in natur is still in itself wholli
abnorm i refer to the manner in which the bee will dispos of a
mous or a slug that mai happen to have found it wai into the hive
the intrud kill thei have to deal with the bodi which will
veri soon poison their dwell if it be imposs for them to
expel or dismemb it thei will proce method and
hermet to enclos it in a verit sepulchr of propoli and
wax which will tower fantast abov the ordinari monument of
the citi in on of my hive last year i discov three such tomb
side by side erect with partywal like the cell of the comb
so that no wax should be wast these tomb the prudent
gravedigg had rais over the remain of three snail that a
child had introduc into the hive as a rule when deal with
snail thei will be content to seal up with wax the orific of the
shell but in thi case the shell were more or less crack and
broken and thei had consid it simpler therefor to buri the
entir snail and had further contriv in order that circul
in the entrancehal might not be imped a number of galleri
exactli proportion not to their own girth but to that of the
male which ar almost twice as larg as themselv doe not thi
instanc and the on that follow warrant our believ that thei
would in time discov the caus of the queen inabl to follow
them through the trelli thei have a veri nice sens of proport
and of the space requir for the movement of bodi in the region
where the hideou deathshead sphinx the acherontia atropo
abound thei construct littl pillar of wax at the entranc of the
hive so restrict the dimens as to prevent the passag of the
nocturn maraud enorm abdomen
36
but enough on thi point were i to cite everi instanc i should
never have done to return to the queen whose posit in the hive
and the part that she plai therein we shall most fitli describ by
declar her to be the captiv heart of the citi and the centr
around which it intellig revolv uniqu sovereign though she
be she is also the royal servant the respons deleg of love
and it captiv custodian her peopl serv her and vener her
but thei never forget that it is not to her person that their homag
is given but to the mission that she fulfil and the destini she
repres it would not be easi for us to find a human republ
whose scheme compris more of the desir of our planet or a
democraci that offer an independ more perfect and ration
combin with a submiss more logic and more complet and
nowher sure should we discov more pain and absolut
sacrific let it not be imagin that i admir thi sacrific to
the extent that i admir it result it were evid to be
desir that these result might be obtain at the cost of less
renounc and suffer but the principl onc acceptedand
thi is need perhap in the scheme of our globeit
organis compel our wonder whatev the human truth on thi
point mai be life in the hive is not look on as a seri of
more or less pleasant hour whereof it is wise that those moment
onli should be sour and embitt that ar essenti for
maintain exist the bee regard it as a great common duti
imparti distribut amongst them all and tend toward a
futur that goe further and further back ever sinc the world
began and for the sake of thi futur each on renounc more
than half of her right and her joi the queen bid farewel to
freedom the light of dai and the calyx of flower the worker
give five or six year of their life and shall never know love or
the joi of matern the queen brain turn to pulp that the
reproduct organ mai profit in the worker these organ atrophi
to the benefit of their intellig nor would it be fair to alleg
that the will plai no part in all these renounc we have seen
that each worker larva can be transform into a queen if lodg
and fed on the royal plan and similarli could each royal larva be
turn into worker if her food were chang and her cell reduc
these mysteri elect take place everi dai in the golden shade
of the hive it is not chanc that control them but a wisdom whose
deep loyalti graviti and unsleep watch man alon can
betrai a wisdom that make and unmak and keep care watch
over all that happen within and without the citi if sudden flower
abound or the queen grow old or less fruit if popul
increas and be press for room you then shall find that the bee
will proce to rear royal cell but these cell mai be destroi
if the harvest fail or the hive be enlarg often thei will be
retain so long as the young queen have not accomplish or
succeed in her marriag flightto be at onc annihil when
she return trail behind her trophywis the infal sign
of her impregn who shall sai where the wisdom resid that can
thu balanc present and futur and prefer what is not yet visibl
to that which alreadi is seen where the anonym prudenc that
select and abandon rais and lower that of so mani worker
make so mani queen and of so mani mother can make a peopl of
virgin we have said elsewher that it lodg in the spirit of the
hive but where shall thi spirit of the hive be look for if not
in the assembl of worker to be convinc of it resid there
we need not perhap have studi so close the habit of thi royal
republ it wa enough to place under the microscop as dujardin
brandt girard vogel and other entomologist have done the littl
uncouth and careworn head of the virgin worker side by side with the
somewhat empti skull of the queen and the male magnific
cranium glisten with it twentysix thousand ey within thi
tini head we should find the work of the vastest and most
magnific brain of the hive the most beauti and complex the
most perfect that in anoth order and with a differ
organis is to be found in natur after that of man here
again as in everi quarter where the scheme of the world is known to
us there where the brain is ar author and victori verit
strength and wisdom and here again it is an almost invis atom
of thi mysteri substanc that organis and subjug matter
and is abl to creat it own littl triumphant and perman place
in the midst of the stupend inert forc of nothing and
death
the brain of the bee accord to the calcul of
dujardin constitut the 1174th part of the insect
weight and that of the ant the 1296th on the other hand
the peduncular part whose develop usual keep pace
with the triumph the intellect achiev over instinct ar
somewhat less import in the bee than in the ant it would
seem to result from these estimateswhich ar of cours
hypothet and deal with a matter that is exceedingli
obscurethat the intellectu valu of the bee and the ant
must be more or less equal
37
and now to return to our swarm hive where the bee have alreadi
given the signal for departur without wait for these
reflect of our to come to an end at the moment thi signal is
given it is as though on sudden mad impuls had simultan
flung open wide everi singl gate in the citi and the black throng
issu or rather pour forth in a doubl or trebl or quadrupl
jet as the number of exit mai be in a tens direct vibrat
uninterrupt stream that at onc dissolv and melt into space
where the myriad transpar furiou wing weav a tissu throb
with sound and thi for some moment will quiver right over the
hive with prodigi rustl of gossam silk that countless
electrifi hand might be ceaselessli rend and stitch it
float undul it trembl and flutter like a veil of glad
invis finger support in the sky and wave to and fro from the
flower to the blue expect sublim advent or departur and at
last on angl declin anoth is lift the radiant mantl unit
it four sunlit corner and like the wonder carpet the
fairytal speak of that flit across space to obei it master
command it steer it straight cours bend forward a littl as
though to hide in it fold the sacr presenc of the futur
toward the willow the peartre or lime whereon the queen ha
alight and round her each rhythmic wave come to rest as
though on a nail of gold and suspend it fabric of pearl and of
lumin wing
and then there is silenc onc more and in an instant thi mighti
tumult thi aw curtain appar laden with unspeak menac
and anger thi bewild golden hail that stream upon everi
object nearal these becom mere a great inoffens peac
cluster of bee compos of thousand of littl motionless group
that patient wait as thei hang from the branch of a tree for the
scout to return who have gone in search of a place of shelter
38
thi is the first stage of what is known as the primari swarm at
whose head the old queen is alwai to be found thei will settl as
a rule on the shrub or the tree that is nearest the hive for the
queen besid be weigh down by her egg ha dwelt in constant
dark ever sinc her marriageflight or the swarm of the
previou year and is natur reluct to ventur far into space
have inde almost forgotten the us of her wing
the beekeep wait till the mass be complet gather togeth
then have cover hi head with a larg straw hat for the most
inoffens bee will conceiv itself caught in a trap if entangl
in hair and will infal us it sting but if he be
experienc wear neither mask nor veil have taken the
precaut onli of plung hi arm in cold water up to the elbow
he proce to gather the swarm by vigor shake the bough from
which the bee depend over an invert hive into thi hive the
cluster will fall as heavili as an overrip fruit or if the
branch be too stout he can plung a spoon into the mass and
deposit where he will the live spoon as though he were
ladl out corn he need have no fear of the bee that ar buzz
around him settl on hi face and hand the air resound with
their song of ecstasi which is differ far from their chant of
anger he need have no fear that the swarm will divid or grow
fierc will scatter or try to escap thi is a dai i repeat
when a spirit of holidai would seem to anim these mysteri
worker a spirit of confid that appar noth can
troubl thei have detach themselv from the wealth thei had to
defend and thei no longer recognis their enemi thei becom
inoffens becaus of their happi though why thei ar happi we
know not except it be becaus thei ar obei their law a moment
of such blind happi is accord by natur at time to everi
live thing when she seek to accomplish her end nor need we feel
ani surpris that here the bee ar her dupe we ourselv who
have studi her movement these centuri past and with a brain
more perfect than that of the bee we too ar her dupe and know
not even yet whether she be benevol or indiffer or onli
base cruel
there where the queen ha alight the swarm will remain and had
she descend alon into the hive the bee would have follow in
long black file as soon as intellig had reach them of the
matern retreat the major will hasten to her with utmost
eager but larg number will paus for an instant on the
threshold of the unknown abod and there will describ the circl
of solemn rejoic with which it is their habit to celebr happi
event thei ar beat to arm sai the french peasant and
then the strang home will at onc be accept and it remotest
corner explor it posit in the apiari it form it colour
ar grasp and retain in these thousand of prudent and faith

mind and the heart of all it inhabit the wall resound with
the lovehymn of the royal presenc and work begin
39
but if the swarm be not gather by man it histori will not end
here it will remain suspend on the branch until the return of the
worker who act as scout wing quartermast as it were
have at the veri first moment of swarm salli forth in all
direct in search of a lodg thei return on by on and
render account of their mission and as it is manifestli imposs
for us to fathom the thought of the bee we can onli interpret in
human fashion the spectacl that thei present we mai regard it as
probabl therefor that most care attent is given to the
report of the variou scout on of them it mai be dwell on the
advantag of some hollow tree it ha seen anoth is in favour of a
crevic in a ruinou wall of a caviti in a grotto or an abandon
burrow the assembl often will paus and deliber until the
follow morn then at last the choic is made and approv by
all at a given moment the entir mass stir disunit set in
motion and then in on sustain and impetu flight that thi
time know no obstacl it will steer it straight cours over
hedg and cornfield over haystack and lake over river and
villag to it determin and alwai distant goal it is rare
inde that thi second stage can be follow by man the swarm
return to natur and we lose the track of it destini
iii the foundat of the citi
40
let us rather consid the proceed of the swarm the apiarist
shall have gather into hi hive and first of all let us not be
forget of the sacrific these fifti thousand virgin have made
who as ronsard sing
in a littl bodi bear so true a heart
and let us yet onc again admir the courag with which thei begin
life anew in the desert whereon thei have fallen thei have
forgotten the splendour and wealth of their nativ citi where
exist had been so admir organis and certain where the
essenc of everi flower reminisc of sunshin had enabl them to
smile at the menac of winter there asleep in the depth of their
cradl thei have left thousand and thousand of daughter whom
thei never again will see thei have abandon not onli the

befor rais the fold of the mysteri curtain beneath whose
shelter ar laid the verit foundat of the home let us
endeavour to form some concept of the sure of vision the
accur calcul and industri our littl peopl of emigr
will be call to displai in order to adapt thi new dwell to
their requir in the void round about them thei must lai the
plan for their citi and logic mark out the site of the

and care attent be given to the distribut of store and
hous passag and streetsthi howev is in some measur
preestablish the plan alreadi arriv at be organ the
bestand there ar countless problem besid whose enumer
would take too long
now the form of the hive that man offer to the bee know infinit
varieti from the hollow tree or earthenwar vessel still obtain
in asia and africa and the familiar bellshap construct of
straw which we find in our farmer kitchengarden or beneath their
window lost beneath mass of sunflow phlox and hollyhock to
what mai realli be term the factori of the model apiarist of
todai an edific thi that can contain more than three hundr
pound of honei in three or four stori of superpos comb
enclos in a frame which permit of their be remov and
handl of the harvest be extract through centrifug forc by
mean of a turbin and of their be then restor to their place
like a book in a wellord librari
and on fine dai the industri or capric of man will instal a
docil swarm in on of these disconcert abod and there the
littl insect is expect to learn it bear to find it wai to
establish it home to modifi the seemingli unchang plan
dictat by the natur of thing in thi unfamiliar place it is
requir to determin the site of the winter storehous that must
not extend beyond the zone of heat that issu from the halfnumb

be ha just left the trunk of a fallen tree contain on long
narrow depress horizont galleri and it find itself now in a
towershap edific whose roof is lost in gloom or to take a
case that is more usual perhap and on that will give some idea
of the surpris habitu in store for the bee after have live
for centuri past beneath the straw dome of our villag hive thei
ar suddenli transplant to a speci of mighti cupboard or chest
three or four time as larg as the place of their birth and
instal in the midst of a confus scaffold of superpos
frame some run parallel to the entranc and some
perpendicular the whole form a bewild network that obscur
the surfac of their dwell
and yet for all thi there exist not a singl instanc of a swarm
refus it duti or allow itself to be baffl or discourag
by the strang of it surround except onli in the case of
the new dwell be absolut uninhabit or impregn with
evil odour and even then the bee will not be dishearten or
bewild even then thei will not abandon their mission the swarm
will simpli forsak the inhospit abod to seek better fortun
some littl distanc awai and similarli it can never be said of
them that thei can be induc to undertak ani illog or foolish
task their commonsens ha never been known to fail them thei
have never at a loss for definit decis erect at haphazard
structur of a wild or heterogen natur though you place the
swarm in a sphere a cube or a pyramid in an oval or polygon
basket you will find on visit the bee a few dai later that
if thi strang assembl of littl independ intellect ha
accept the new abod thei will at onc and unhesitatingli and
unanim have known how to select the most favour often
humanli speak the onli possibl spot in thi absurd habit
in pursuanc of a method whose principl mai appear inflex but
whose result ar strikingli vivid
when instal in on of the huge factori bristl with frame
that we mention just now these frame will interest them onli to
the extent in which thei provid them with a basi or point of
departur for their comb and thei veri natur pai not the
slightest heed to the desir or intent of man but if the
apiarist have taken the precaut of surround the upper lath of
some of these frame with a narrow fillet of wax thei will be quick
to perceiv the advantag thi tempt offer present and will
carefulli extract the fillet us their own wax as solder and
will prolong the comb in accord with the indic plan
similarlyand the case is frequent in modern apicultureif all the
frame of the hive into which the bee have been gather be cover
from top to bottom with leav of foundationwax thei will not
wast time in erect build across or besid these or in
produc useless wax but find that the work is alreadi half
finish thei will be satisfi to deepen and lengthen each of the

is the slightest deviat from the strictest vertic proceed
in thi fashion therefor thei will possess in a week a citi as
luxuri and wellconstruct as the on thei have quit
wherea had thei been thrown on their own resourc it would have
taken them two or three month to construct so great a profus of
dwell and storehous of shine wax
43
thi power of appropri mai well be consid to overstep the
limit of instinct and inde there can be noth more arbitrari
than the distinct we draw between instinct and intellig
properli socal sir john lubbock whose observ on ant
bee and wasp ar so interest and so person is reluct to
credit the bee from the moment it forsak the routin of it
habitu labour with ani power of discern or reason thi
attitud of hi mai be due in some measur to an unconsci bia in
favour of the ant whose wai he ha more special note for the
entomologist is alwai inclin to regard that insect as the more
intellig to which he ha more particularli devot himself and
we have to be on our guard against thi littl person
predilect as a proof of hi theori sir john cite as an
instanc an experi within the reach of all if you place in a
bottl half a dozen bee and the same number of fli and lai the
bottl down horizont with it base to the window you will find
that the bee will persist till thei die of exhaust or hunger
in their endeavour to discov an issu through the glass while the
fli in less than two minut will all have salli forth through
the neck on the opposit side from thi sir john lubbock conclud
that the intellig of the bee is exceedingli limit and that
the fly show far greater skill in extric itself from a
difficulti and find it wai thi conclus howev would not
seem altogeth flawless turn the transpar sphere twenti time
if you will hold now the base now the neck to the window and
you will find that the bee will turn twenti time with it so as
alwai to face the light it is their love of the light it is their
veri intellig that is their undo in thi experi of the
english savant thei evid imagin that the issu from everi
prison must be there where the light shine clearest and thei act
in accord and persist in too logic action to them glass is a
supernatur mysteri thei never have met with in natur thei have
had no experi of thi suddenli impenetr atmospher and the
greater their intellig the more inadmiss more
incomprehens will the strang obstacl appear wherea the
featherbrain fli careless of logic as of the enigma of crystal
disregard the call of the light flutter wildli hither and
thither and meet here the good fortun that often wait on the
simpl who find salvat there where the wiser will perish
necessarili end by discov the friendli open that restor
their liberti to them
the same naturalist cite yet anoth proof of the bee lack of
intellig and discov it in the follow quotat from the
great american apiarist the vener and patern langstroth
as the fly wa not intend to banquet on blossom but on
substanc in which it might easili be drown it cautious
alight on the edg of ani vessel contain liquid food and warili
help itself while the poor bee plung in headlong speedili
perish the sad fate of their unfortun companion doe not in
the least deter other who approach the tempt lure from madli
alight on the bodi of the dy and the dead to share the same
miser end no on can understand the extent of their infatu
until he ha seen a confection shop assail by myriad of
hungri bee i have seen thousand strain out from the syrup in
which thei had perish thousand more alight even on the
boil sweet the floor cover and window darken with bee
some crawl other fly and other still so complet
besmear as to be abl neither to crawl nor to flynot on in ten
abl to carri home it illgotten spoil and yet the air fill
with new host of thoughtless comer
thi howev seem to me no more conclus than might be the
spectacl of a battlefield or of the ravag of alcohol to a
superhuman observ bent on establish the limit of human
understand inde less so perhap for the situat of the
bee when compar with our own is strang in thi world it wa
intend to live in the midst of an indiffer and unconsci
natur and not by the side of an extraordinari be who is forev
disturb the most constant law and produc grandios
inexplic phenomena in the natur order of thing in the
monoton life of the forest the mad langstroth describ
would be possibl onli were some accid suddenli to destroi a hive
full of honei but in thi case even there would be no fatal
glass no boil sugar or cloi syrup no death or danger
therefor other than that to which everi anim is expos while
seek it prei
should we be more success than thei in preserv our presenc of
mind if some strang power were at everi step to ensnar our reason
let us not be too hasti in condemn the bee for the folli whereof
we ar the author or in derid their intellect which is as
poorli equip to foil our artific as our own would be to foil
those of some superior creatur unknown to us todai but on that
account not imposs none such be known at present we
conclud that we stand on the topmost pinnacl of life on thi
earth but thi belief after all is by no mean infal i am
not assum that when our action ar unreason or
contempt we mere fall into the snare that such a creatur
ha laid though it is not inconceiv that thi should on dai be
prove true on the other hand it cannot be wise to deni
intellig to the bee becaus it ha not yet succeed in
distinguish us from the great ap or the bear it is certain that
there ar in us and about us influenc and power no less
dissimilar whose distinct escap us as readili
and final to end thi apolog wherein i seem somewhat to have
fallen into the error i laid to sir john lubbock charg doe not
the capac for folli so great in itself argu intellig for
thu it is ever in the uncertain domain of the intellect appar
the most vacil and precari condit of matter the same
light that fall on the intellect fall also on passion whereof
none can tell whether it be the smoke of the flame or the wick in
the case abov it ha not been mere anim desir to gorg
themselv with honei that ha urg on the bee thei could do thi
at their leisur in the storeroom at home watch them in an
analog circumst follow them you will see that as soon as
their sac is fill thei will return to the hive and add their
spoil to the gener store and visit the marvel vintag and
leav it perhap thirti time in an hour their admir labour
therefor ar inspir by a singl desir zeal to bring as much
wealth as thei can to the home of their sister which is also the
home of the futur when we discov a caus as disinterest for
the folli of men we ar apt to call them by anoth name
44
howev the whole truth must be told in the midst of the marvel
of their industri their polici their sacrific on thing exist
that must alwai check and weaken our admir and thi is the
indiffer with which thei regard the misfortun or death of
their comrad there is a strang dualiti in the charact of the
bee in the heart of the hive all help and love each other thei ar
as unit as the good thought that dwell in the same soul wound
on of them and a thousand will sacrific themselv to aveng it
injuri but outsid the hive thei no longer recognis each other
mutil them crush themor rather do noth of the kind it
would be a useless cruelti for the fact is establish beyond ani
doubtbut were you to mutil or crush on a piec of comb
place a few step from their dwell twenti or thirti bee that
have all issu from the same hive those you have left untouch
will not even turn their head with their tongu fantast as a
chines weapon thei will tranquilli continu to absorb the liquid
thei hold more preciou than life heedless of the agoni whose last
gestur almost ar touch them of the cri of distress that
aris all around and when the comb is empti so great is their
anxieti that noth shall be lost that their eager to gather
the honei which cling to the victim will induc them tranquilli to
climb over dead and dy unmov by the presenc of the first and
never dream of help the other in thi case therefor thei
have no notion of the danger thei run see that thei ar wholli
untroubl by the death that is scatter about them and thei have
not the slightest sens of solidar or piti as regard the
danger the explan li readi to hand the bee know not the
mean of fear and with the except onli of smoke ar afraid
of noth in the world outsid the hive thei displai extrem
condescens and forbear thei will avoid whatev disturb
them and affect to ignor it exist so long as it come not too
close as though awar that thi univers belong to all that each
on ha hi place there and must need be discreet and peac
but beneath thi indulg is quietli hidden a heart so sure of
itself that it never dream of protest if thei ar threaten
thei will alter their cours but never attempt to escap in the
hive howev thei will not confin themselv to thi passiv
ignor of peril thei will spring with incred furi on ani
live thing ant or lion or man that dare to profan the sacr
ark thi we mai term anger ridicul obstinaci or heroism
accord as our mind be dispos
but of their want of solidar outsid the hive and even of
sympathi within it i can find noth to sai ar we to believ
that each form of intellect possess it own strang limit
and that the tini flame which with so much difficulti at last burn
it wai through inert matter and issu forth from the brain is
still so uncertain that if it illumin on point more strongli the
other ar forc into blacker dark here we find that the bee
or natur act within them have organis work in common the
love and cult of the futur in a manner more perfect than can
elsewher be discov is it for thi reason that thei have lost
sight of all the rest thei give their love to what li ahead of
them we bestow our on what is around and we who love here
perhap have no love left for what is beyond noth vari so
much as the direct of piti or chariti we ourselv should
formerli have been far less shock than we ar todai at the
insens of the bee and to mani an ancient peopl such
conduct would not have seem blameworthi and further can we tell
how mani of the thing that we do would shock a be who might be
watch us as we watch the bee
iv the life of the bee
45
let us now in order to form a clearer concept of the bee
intellectu power proce to consid their method of
intercommun there can be no doubt that thei understand
each other and inde it were sure imposs for a republ so
consider wherein the labour ar so vari and so marvel
combin to subsist amid the silenc and spiritu isol of so
mani thousand creatur thei must be abl therefor to give
express to thought and feel by mean either of a phonet
vocabulari or more probabl of some kind of tactil languag or
magnet intuit correspond perhap to sens and properti
of matter wholli unknown to ourselv and such intuit well might
lodg in the mysteri antennaecontain in the case of the
worker accord to cheshir calcul twelv thousand
tactil hair and five thousand smellhollow wherewith thei
probe and fathom the dark for the mutual understand of the
bee is not confin to their habitu labour the extraordinari
also ha a name and place in their languag as is prove by the
manner in which new good or bad normal or supernatur will at
onc spread in the hive the loss or return of the mother for
instanc the entranc of an enemi the intrus of a strang
queen the approach of a band of maraud the discoveri of
treasur etc and so characterist is their attitud so
essenti differ their murmur at each of these special event
that the experienc apiarist can without difficulti tell what is
troubl the crowd that move distractedli to and fro in the
shadow
if you desir a more definit proof you have but to watch a bee
that shall just have discov a few drop of honei on your
windowsil or the corner of your tabl she will immedi gorg
herself with it and so eagerli that you will have time without
fear of disturb her to mark her tini belt with a touch of paint
but thi gluttoni of her is all on the surfac the honei will not
pass into the stomach proper into what we might call her person
stomach but remain in the sac the first stomachthat of the
commun if on mai so express it thi reservoir full the bee
will depart but not with the free and thoughtless motion of the fly
or butterfli she on the contrari will for some moment fly
backward hover eagerli about the tabl or window with her head
turn toward the room
she is reconnoitr fix in her memori the exact posit of the
treasur thereupon she will go to the hive disgorg her plunder
into on of the provisioncel and in three or four minut
return and resum oper at the providenti window and thu
while the honei last will she come and go at interv of everi
five minut till even if need be without interrupt or
rest pursu her regular journei from the hive to the window
from the window back to the hive
46
mani of those who have written on bee have thought fit to adorn the
truth i myself have no such desir for studi of thi descript
to possess ani interest it is essenti that thei should remain
absolut sincer had the conclus been forc upon me that bee
ar incap of commun to each other new of an event
occur outsid the hive i should i imagin as a setoff
against the slight disappoint thi discoveri would have
entail have deriv some degre of satisfact in recognis
onc more that man after all is the onli truli intellig be
who inhabit our globe and there come too a period of life when we
have more joi in sai the thing that is true than in sai the
thing that mere is wonder here as in everi case the principl
hold that should the nake truth appear at the moment less
interest less great and nobl than the imaginari embellish
it li in our power to bestow the fault must rest with ourselv
who still ar unabl to perceiv the astonish relat in which
thi truth alwai must stand to our be and to univers law and
in that case it is not the truth but our intellect that need
embellish and ennobl
i will frankli confess therefor that the mark bee often return
alon shall we believ that in bee there exist the same
differ of charact as in men that of them too some ar
gossip and other prone to silenc a friend who stood by and
watch my experi declar that it wa evid mere
selfish or vaniti that caus so mani of the bee to refrain
from reveal the sourc of their wealth and from share with
other the glori of an achiev that must seem miracul to the
hive these were sad vice inde which give not forth the sweet
odour so fragrant and loyal that spring from the home of the mani
thousand sister but whatev the caus it often will also happen
that the bee whom fortun ha favour will return to the honei
accompani by two or three friend i am awar that sir john
lubbock in the appendix to hi book on ant bee and wasp
record the result of hi investig in long and minut tabl
and from these we ar led to infer that it is a matter of rarest
occurr for a singl bee to follow the on who ha made the
discoveri the learn naturalist doe not name the race of bee
which he select for hi experi or tell us whether the
condit were especi unfavour as for myself i onli can
sai that my own tabl compil with great careand everi
possibl precaut have been taken that the bee should not be
directli attract by the odour of the honeyestablish that on an
averag on bee will bring other four time out of ten
i even on dai came across an extraordinari littl italian bee
whose belt i had mark with a touch of blue paint in her second
trip she brought two of her sister whom i imprison without
interf with her she depart onc more and thi time return
with three friend whom i again confin and so till the end of
the afternoon when count my prison i found that she had
told the new to no less than eighteen bee
in fact you will find if you make thi experi yourself that
commun if not gener at least is frequent the possess
of thi faculti is so well known to american beehunt that thei
trade upon it when engag in search for nest mr josiah emeri
remark on thi head quot by roman in hi intellect of anim
go to a field or wood at a distanc from tame bee with
their box of honei thei gather up from the flower and imprison on
or more bee and after thei have becom suffici gorg let
them out to return to their home with their easili gotten load
wait patient a longer or shorter time accord to the
distanc of the beetre the hunter scarc ever fail to see the
bee or bee return accompani by other bee which ar in like
manner imprison till thei in turn ar fill then on or more ar
let out at place distant from each other and the direct in
which the bee fli note and thu by a kind of triangul the
posit of the beetre proxim ascertain
47
you will notic too in your experi that the friend who appear
to obei the behest of good fortun do not alwai fly togeth and
that there will often be an interv of sever second between the
differ arriv as regard these commun therefor we
must ask ourselv the question that sir john lubbock ha solv as
far as the ant ar concern
do the comrad who flock to the treasur onli follow the bee that
first made the discoveri or have thei been sent on by her and do
thei find it through follow her indic her descript of
the place where it li between these two hypothes that refer
directli to the extent and work of the bee intellect there is
obvious an enorm differ the english savant ha succeed
by mean of an elabor and ingeni arrang of gangwai
corridor moat full of water and fly bridg in establish
that the ant in such case do no more than follow in the track of
the pioneer insect with ant that can be made to pass where on
will such experi ar possibl but for the bee whose wing
throw everi avenu open some other expedi must of necess be
contriv i imagin the follow which though it gave no
definit result might yet under more favour condit and if
organis more carefulli give rise to definit and satisfactori
conclus
my studi in the countri is on the first floor abov a somewhat
lofti room suffici high therefor to be out of the ordinari
rang of the bee flight except at time when the chestnut and
lime tree ar in bloom and for more than a week befor i start
thi experi i had kept on my tabl an open comb of honei
without the perfum have attract or induc the visit of a
singl bee then i went to a glass hive that wa close to the hous
took an italian bee brought her to my studi set her on the comb
and mark her while she wa feed
when satisfi she flew awai and return to the hive i follow
saw her pass over the surfac of the crowd plung her head into an
empti cell disgorg her honei and prepar to set forth again at
the door of the hive i had place a glass box divid by a trap
into two compart the bee flew into thi box and as she wa
alon and no other bee seem to accompani or follow her i
imprison her and left her there i then repeat the experi on
twenti differ bee in success when the mark bee reappear
alon i imprison her as i had imprison the first but eight of
them came to the threshold of the hive and enter the box
accompani by two or three friend by mean of the trap i wa abl
to separ the mark bee from her companion and to keep her a
prison in the first compart then have mark her
companion with a differ colour i threw open the second
compart and set them at liberti myself return quickli to my
studi to await their arriv now it is evid that if a verbal or
magnet commun had pass indic the place describ
the wai etc a certain number of the bee have been furnish
with thi inform should have found their wai to my room i am
compel to admit that there came but a singl on wa thi mere
chanc or had she follow instruct receiv the experi
wa insuffici but circumst prevent me from carri it
further i releas the bait bee and my studi soon wa
besieg by the buzz crowd to whom thei had taught the wai to the
treasur
we need not concern ourselv with thi incomplet attempt of mine
for mani other curiou trait compel us to recognis the exist
among the bee of spiritu commun that go beyond a mere
ye or no and that ar manifest in case where mere exampl or
gestur would not be suffici of such for instanc ar the
remark harmoni of their work in the hive the extraordinari
divis of labour the regular with which on worker will take
the place of anoth etc i have often mark bee that went
forag in the morn and found that in the afternoon unless
flower were special abund thei would be engag in heat
and fan the broodcel or perhap would form part of the
mysteri motionless curtain in whose midst the waxmak and
sculptor would be at work similarli i have notic that worker
whom i have seen gather pollen for the whole of on dai will
bring no pollen back on the morrow but will concern themselv
exclus with the search for nectar and viceversa
48
and further we might mention what m georg de layen the
celebr french apiarist term the distribut of bee over
mellifer plant dai after dai at the first hour of sunris
the explor of the dawn return and the hive awak to receiv the
good new of the earth the lime tree ar blossom todai on the
bank of the canal the grass by the roadsid is gai with white
clover the sage and the lotu ar about to open the
mignonett the lili ar overflow with pollen whereupon the
bee must organis quickli and arrang to divid the work five
thousand of the sturdiest will sulli forth to the lime tree while
three thousand junior go and refresh the white clover those who
yesterdai were absorb nectar from the corolla will todai repos
their tongu and the gland of their sac and gather red pollen from
the mignonett or yellow pollen from the tall lili for never
shall you see a bee collect or mix pollen of a differ
colour or speci and inde on of the chief preoccup of
the hive is the method bestow of these pollen in the
storeroom in strict accord with their origin and colour thu
doe the hidden geniu issu it command the worker immedi
salli forth in long black file whereof each on will fly straight
to it allot task the bee sai de layen would seem to be
perfectli inform as to the local the rel mellifer
valu and the distanc of everi mellifer plant within a certain
radiu from the hive
if we carefulli note the differ direct in which these
forag fly and observ in detail the harvest thei gather from the
variou plant around we shall find that the worker distribut
themselv over the flower in proport not onli to the number of
flower of on speci but also to their mellifer valu nai
morethei make daili calcul as to the mean of obtain the
greatest possibl wealth of saccharin liquid in the spring for
instanc after the willow have bloom when the field still ar
bare and the first flower of the wood ar the on resourc of the
bee we shall see them eagerli visit gors and violet
lungwort and anemon but a few dai later when field of
cabbag and colza begin to flower in suffici abund we shall
find that the bee will almost entir forsak the plant in the
wood though these be still in full blossom and will confin their
visit to the flower of cabbag and colza alon in thi fashion
thei regul dai by dai their distribut over the plant so as
to collect the greatest valu of saccharin liquid in the least
possibl time
it mai fairli be claim therefor for the coloni of bee that
in it harvest labour no less than in it intern economi it
is abl to establish a ration distribut of the number of
worker without ever disturb the principl of the divis of
labour

but what have we to do some will ask with the intellig of the
bee what concern is it of our whether thi be a littl less or a
littl more why weigh with such infinit care a minut fragment
of almost invis matter as though it were a fluid whereon
depend the destini of man i hold and exagger noth that
our interest herein is of the most consider the discoveri of a
sign of true intellect outsid ourselv procur us someth of
the emot robinson cruso felt when he saw the imprint of a human
foot on the sandi beach of hi island we seem less solitari than we
had believ and inde in our endeavour to understand the
intellect of the bee we ar studi in them that which is most
preciou in our own substanc an atom of the extraordinari matter
which possess wherev it attach itself the magnific power of
transfigur blind necess of organis embellish and
multipli life and most strike of all of hold in suspens
the obstin forc of death and the mighti irrespons wave
that wrap almost all that exist in an etern unconsci
were we sole possessor of the particl of matter that when
maintain in a special condit of flower or incandesc we
term the intellect we should to some extent be entitl to look on
ourselv as privileg be and to imagin that in us natur
achiev some kind of aim but here we discov in the hymenoptera
an entir categori of be in whom a more or less ident aim is
achiev and thi fact though it decid noth perhap still
hold an honour place in the mass of tini fact that help to
throw light on our posit in thi world it afford even if
consid from a certain point of view a fresh proof of the most
enigmat part of our be for the superposit of destini
that we find in the hive ar survei by us from an emin loftier
than ani we can attain for the contempl of the destini of
man there we see befor us in miniatur the larg and simpl
line that in our own disproportion sphere we never have the
occas to disentangl and follow to the end spirit and matter ar
there the race and the individu evolut and perman life
and death the past and the futur all gather togeth in a
retreat that our hand can lift and on look of our ey embrac and
mai we not reason ask ourselv whether the mere size of a bodi
and the room that it fill in time and space can modifi to the
extent we imagin the secret idea of natur the idea that we try to
discov in the littl histori of the hive which in a few dai
alreadi is ancient no less than in the great histori of man of
whom three gener overlap a long centuri
50
let us go on then with the stori of our hive let us take it up
where we left it and rais as high as we mai a fold of the
festoon curtain in whose midst a strang sweat white as snow and
airier than the down of a wing is begin to break over the
swarm for the wax that is now be born is not like the wax that
we know it is immacul it ha no weight seem truli to be the
soul of the honei that itself is the spirit of flower and thi
motionless incant ha call it forth that it mai serv us
laterin memori of it origin doubtless wherein it is on with
the azur sky and heavi with perfum of magnific and
puritya the fragrant light of the last of our altar
51
to follow the variou phase of the secret and employ of wax
by a swarm that is begin to build is a matter of veri great
difficulti all come to pass in the blackest depth of the crowd
whose agglomer grow denser and denser produc the
temperatur need for thi exud which is the privileg of
the youngest bee huber who wa the first to studi these
phenomena bring incred patienc to bear and expos himself
at time to veri seriou danger devot to them more than two
hundr and fifti page which though of consider interest ar
necessarili somewhat confus but i am not treat thi subject
technic and while refer when necessari to huber admir
studi i shall confin myself gener to relat what is patent
to ani on who mai gather a swarm into a glass hive
we have to admit first of all that we know not yet by what process
of alchemi the honei transform itself into wax in the enigmat
bodi of our suspend bee we can onli sai that thei will remain
thu suspend for a period extend from eighteen to twentyfour
hour in a temperatur so high that on might almost believ that a
fire wa burn in the hollow of the hive and then white and
transpar scale will appear at the open of four littl pocket
that everi bee ha underneath it abdomen
when the bodi of most of those who form the invert cone have
thu been adorn with ivori tablet we shall see on of the bee
as though suddenli inspir abruptli detach herself from the mass
and climb over the back of the passiv crowd till she reach the
inner pinnacl of the cupola to thi she will fix herself solidli
dislodg with repeat blow of her head such of her neighbour
as mai seem to hamper her movement then with her mouth and claw
she will seiz on of the eight scale that hang from her abdomen
and at onc proce to clip it and plane it extend it knead it
with her saliva bend it and flatten it roll it and straighten it
with the skill of a carpent handl a pliabl panel when at last
the substanc thu treat appear to her to possess the requir
dimens and consist she will attach it to the highest point
of the dome thu lai the first or rather the keyston of the
new town for we have here an invert citi hang down from the
sky and not rise from the bosom of earth like a citi of men
to thi keyston depend in the void she will add other
fragment of wax that she take in success from beneath her ring
of horn and final with on last lick of the tongu on last
wave of antenna she will go as suddenli as she came and disappear
in the crowd anoth will at onc take her place continu the work
at the point where the first on ha left it add on her own chang
and adjust whatev mai seem to offend the ideal plan of the tribe
then vanish in her turn to be succeed by a third a fourth and a
fifth all appear unexpectedli suddenli on after the other
none complet the work but each bring her share to the task in
which all combin
52
a small block of wax formless as yet hang down from the top of
the vault so soon as it thick mai be deem suffici we
shall see anoth bee emerg from the mass her physic appear
differ appreci from that of the foundress who preced her
and her manner displai such settl convict her movement ar
follow so eagerli by all the crowd that we almost might fanci
that some illustri engin had been summon to trace in the
void the site of the first cell of all from which everi other must
mathemat depend thi bee belong to the sculptor or carver
class of worker she produc no wax herself and is content to deal
with the materi other provid she locat the first cell
scoop into the block for an instant lai the wax she ha remov
from the caviti on the border around it and then like the
foundress abruptli depart and abandon her model her place is
taken at onc by an impati worker who continu the task that a
third will finish while other close by ar attack the rest of
the surfac and the opposit side of the wall each on obei the
gener law of interrupt and success labour as though it were
an inher principl of the hive that the pride of toil should be
distribut and everi achiev be anonym and common to all
that it might therebi becom more fratern
53
the outlin of the nascent comb mai soon be divin in form it will
still be lenticular for the littl prismat tube that compos it
ar unequ in length and diminish in proport as thei reced
from the centr to the extrem in thick and appear at
present it more or less resembl a human tongu whose side might
be form of hexagon cell contigu and place back to back
the first cell have been built the foundress proce to add a
second block of wax to the roof and so in gradat a third and a
fourth these block follow each other at regular interv so
nice calcul that when at a much later period the comb shall
be fulli develop there will be ampl space for the bee to move
between it parallel wall
their plan must therefor embrac the final thick of everi comb
which will be from eightyeight to ninetytwo hundredth of an inch
and at the same time the width of the avenu between which must be
about half an inch or in other word twice the height of a bee
sinc there must be room to pass back to back between the comb
the bee howev ar not infal nor doe their certainti
appear mechan thei will commit grave error at time when
circumst present unusu difficulti thei will often leav too
much space or too littl between the comb thi thei will remedi
as best thei can either by give an obliqu twist to the comb that
too nearli approach the other or by introduc an irregular comb
into the gap the bee sometim make mistak reaumur remark on
thi subject and herein we mai find yet anoth fact which appear
to prove that thei reason
54
we know that the bee construct four kind of cell first of all
the royal cell which ar except and contriv somewhat in
the shape of an acorn then the larg cell destin for the rear
of male and store of provis when flower superabound and
the small cell serv as worker cradl and ordinari
storeroom which occupi normal about fourfifth of the
builtov surfac of the hive and lastli so as to connect in
orderli fashion the larger cell with the small the bee will erect
a certain number of what ar known as transit cell these must
of necess be irregular in form but so unerringli accur ar
the dimens of the second and third type that at the time when
the decim system wa establish and a fix measur sought in
natur to serv as a startingpoint and an incontest standard
it wa propos by reaumur to select for thi purpos the cell of
the bee
it wa as well perhap that thi standard wa not
adopt for although the diamet of the cell is admir
regular it is like all thing produc by a live
organ not mathemat invari in the same hive
further as m mauric girard ha point out the apothem
of the cell vari among differ race of bee so that
the standard would alter from hive to hive accord to the
speci of bee that inhabit it
each of the cell is an hexagon tube place on a pyramid base
and two layer of these tube form the comb their base be
oppos to each other in such fashion that each of the three rhomb
or lozeng which on on side constitut the pyramid base of on
cell compos at the same time the pyramid base of three cell on
the other it is in these prismat tube that the honei is store
and to prevent it escap dure the period of maturationwhich
would infal happen if the tube were as strictli horizont as
thei appear to beth bee inclin them slightli to an angl of 4
deg or 5 deg
besid the economi of wax sai reaumur when consid thi
marvel construct in it entireti besid the economi of wax
that result from the disposit of the cell and the fact that
thi arrang allow the bee to fill the comb without leav a
singl spot vacant there ar other advantag also with respect to
the solid of the work the angl at the base of each cell the
apex of the pyramid caviti is buttress by the ridg form by
two face of the hexagon of anoth cell the two triangl or
extens of the hexagon face which fill on of the converg
angl of the caviti enclos by the three rhomb form by their
junction a plane angl on the side thei touch each of these angl
concav within the cell support on it convex side on of the
sheet emploi to form the hexagon of anoth cell the sheet
press on thi angl resist the forc which is tend to push
it outward and in thi fashion the angl ar strengthen everi
advantag that could be desir with regard to the solid of each
cell is procur by it own format and it posit with
refer to the other
55
there ar onli sai dr reid three possibl figur of the
cell which can make them all equal and similar without ani useless
interstic these ar the equilater triangl the squar and the
regular hexagon mathematician know that there is not a fourth wai
possibl in which a plane shall be cut into littl space that shall
be equal similar and regular without useless space of the three
figur the hexagon is the most proper for conveni and
strength bee as if thei knew thi make their cell regular
hexagon
again it ha been demonstr that by make the bottom of the
cell to consist of three plane meet in a point there is a
save of materi and labour in no wai inconsider the bee as
if acquaint with these principl of solid geometri follow them
most accur it is a curiou mathemat problem at what
precis angl the three plane which compos the bottom of a cell
ought to meet in order to make the greatest possibl save or the
least expens of materi and labour thi is on of the problem
which belong to the higher part of mathemat it ha accordingli
been resolv by some mathematician particularli by the ingeni
maclaurin by a fluctionari calcul which is to be found in the
transact of the royal societi of london he ha determin
precis the angl requir and he found by the most exact
mensur the subject would admit that it is the veri angl in
which the three plane at the bottom of the cell of a honei comb do
actual meet
reaumur suggest the follow problem to the celebr
mathematician koenig of all possibl hexagon cell with
pyramid base compos of three equal and similar rhomb
to find the on whose construct would need the least
materi koenig answer wa the cell that had for it
base three rhomb whose larg angl wa 109 deg 26 and the
small 70 deg 34 anoth savant maraldi had measur as
exactli as possibl the angl of the rhomb construct by
the bee and discov the larger to be 109 deg 28 and
the other 70 deg 32 between the two solut there wa a
differ therefor of onli 2 it is probabl that the
error if error there be should be attribut to maraldi
rather than to the bee for it is imposs for ani
instrument to measur the angl of the cell which ar not
veri clearli defin with infal precis
the problem suggest to koenig wa put to anoth mathematician
cramer whose solut came even closer to that of the bee viz
109 deg 28 12 for the larg angl and 70 deg 31 12 for the
small
56
i myself do not believ that the bee indulg in these abstrus
calcul but on the other hand it seem equal imposs to
me that such astound result can be due to chanc alon or to
the mere forc of circumst the wasp for instanc also build
comb with hexagon cell so that for them the problem wa
ident and thei have solv it in a far less ingeni fashion
their comb have onli on layer of cell thu lack the common
base that serv the bee for their two opposit layer the wasp
comb therefor is not onli less regular but also less
substanti and so wastefulli construct that besid loss of
materi thei must sacrific about a third of the avail space
and a quarter of the energi thei put forth again we find that the
trigona and melipona which ar verit and domest bee
though of less advanc civilis erect onli on row of
rearingcel and support their horizont superpos comb on
shapeless and costli column of wax their provisioncel ar
mere great pot gather togeth without ani order and at the
point between the sphere where these might have intersect and
induc a profit economi of space and materi the melipona
clumsili insert a section of cell with flat wall inde to
compar on of their nest with the mathemat citi of our own
honeyfli is like imagin a hamlet compos of primit hut
side by side with a modern town whose ruthless regular is the
logic though perhap somewhat charmless result of the geniu of
man that todai more fierc than ever befor seek to conquer
space matter and time
57
there is a theori origin propound by buffon and now reviv
which assum that the bee have not the least intent of
construct hexagon with a pyramid base but that their desir
is mere to contriv round cell in the wax onli that as their
neighbour and those at work on the opposit side of the comb ar
dig at the same moment and with the same intent the point
where the cell meet must of necess becom hexagon besid it
is said thi is precis what happen to crystal the scale of
certain kind of fish soapbubbl etc as it happen in the
follow experi that buffon suggest if he said you fill
a dish with pea or ani other cylindr bean pour as much water
into it as the space between the bean will allow close it
carefulli and then boil the water you will find that all these
cylind have becom sixsid column and the reason is evid
be inde pure mechan each of the cylindr bean tend
as it swell to occupi the utmost possibl space within a given
space wherefor it follow that the reciproc compress compel
them all to becom hexagon similarli each bee seek to occupi the
utmost possibl space within a given space with the necessari
result that it bodi be cylindr the cell becom hexagon
for the same reason as befor viz the work of reciproc
obstacl
58
these reciproc obstacl it would seem ar capabl of marvel
achiev on the same principl doubtless that the vice of man
produc a gener virtu wherebi the human race hate often in
it individu ceas to be so in the mass we might repli first
of all with brougham kirbi and spenc and other that
experi with pea and soapbubbl prove noth for the reason
that in both case the pressur produc onli irregular form and
in no wise explain the exist of the prismat base of the
cell but abov all we might answer that there ar more wai than
on of deal with rigid necess that the wasp the humblebe
the trigona and melipona of mexico and brazil achiev veri
differ and manifestli inferior result although the
circumst and their own intent ar absolut ident
with those of the bee it might further be urg that if the bee
cell doe inde follow the law that govern crystal snow
soapbubbl as well as buffon boil pea it also through it
gener symmetri disposit in opposit layer and angl of
inclin obei mani other law that ar not to be found in
matter mai we not sai too of man that all hi geniu is compris
in hi fashion of handl kindr necess and if it appear to
us that hi manner of treat these is the best there can possibl
be the reason onli can lie in the absenc of a judg superior to
ourselv but it is well that argument should make wai for fact
and inde to the object base on an experi the best repli
of all must be a counterexperi
in order to satisfi myself that hexagon architectur truli wa
written in the spirit of the bee i cut off and remov on dai a
disc of the size of a fivefranc piec from the centr of a comb at
a spot where there were both broodcel and cell full of honei i
cut into the circumfer of thi disc at the intersect point
of the pyramid cell insert a piec of tin on the base of on
of these section shape exactli to it dimens and possess
of resist suffici to prevent the bee from bend or
twist it then i replac the slice of comb duli furnish with
it slab of tin on the spot whenc i had remov it so that while
on side of the comb present no abnorm featur the damag
have been repair the other displai a sort of deep caviti
cover the space of about thirti cell with the piec of tin as
it base the bee were disconcert at first thei flock in
number to inspect and examin thi curiou chasm dai after dai
thei wander agitatedli to and fro appar unabl to form a
decis but as i fed them copious everi even there came a
moment when thei had no more cell avail for the storag of
provis thereupon thei probabl summon their great engin
distinguish sculptor and waxwork and invit them to turn
thi useless caviti to profit account
the waxmak have gather around and form themselv into a
dens festoon so that the necessari heat might be maintain other
bee descend into the hole and proceed solidli to attach the
metal and connect it with the wall of adjac cell by mean of
littl waxen hook which thei distribut regularli over it
surfac in the upper semicircl of the disc thei then began to
construct three or four cell unit these to the hook each of
these transit or accommod cell wa more or less deform
at the top to allow of it be solder to the adjoin cell on
the comb but it lower portion alreadi design on the tin three
veri clear angl whenc there ran three littl straight line that
correctli indic the first half of the follow cell
after fortyeight hour and notwithstand the fact that onli
three bee at a time were abl to work in the caviti the entir
surfac of the tin wa cover with outlin cell these were less
regular certainli than those of an ordinari comb wherefor the
queen have inspect them wise declin to lai ani egg there
for the gener that would have arisen therefrom would
necessarili have been deform each cell howev wa a perfect
hexagon nor did it contain a singl crook line a singl curv
figur or angl and yet the ordinari condit had all been
chang the cell had neither been scoop out of a block
accord to huber descript nor had thei been design within
a waxen hood and from be circular at first been subsequ
convert into hexagon by the pressur of adjoin cell as
explain by darwin neither could there be question here of
reciproc obstacl the cell have been form on by on and
their first line trace on what practic wa a bare tabl it
would seem incontest therefor that the hexagon is not mere
the result of mechan necess but that it ha it true place
in the plan the experi the intellect and will of the bee i
mai relat here anoth curiou instanc of the worker sagac
the cell thei built on the tin had no other base than the metal
itself the engin of the corp had evid decid that the
tin could adequ retain the honei and had consid that the
substanc be imperm thei need not wast the materi thei
valu so highli by cover the metal with a layer of wax but a
short time after some drop of honei have been place in two of
these cell the bee discov in tast it that the contact of
the metal had a deterior effect thereupon thei reconsid
the matter and cover over with wax the entir surfac of the tin
59
were it our desir to throw light upon all the secret of thi
geometr architectur we should have more than on curiou
question still to consid as for instanc the shape of the first
cell which be attach to the roof ar modifi in such a
manner as to touch the roof at the greatest possibl number of
point
the design of the princip thoroughfar is determin by the
parallel of the comb but we must admir the ingeni
construct of allei and gangwai through and around the comb so
skilfulli contriv as to provid short cut in everi direct and
prevent congest of traffic while ensur free circul of
air and final we should have to studi the construct of
transit cell wherein we see a unanim instinct at work that
impel the bee at a given moment to increas the size of their
dwell three reason mai dictat thi step an extraordinari
harvest mai call for larger receptacl the worker mai consid
the popul to be suffici numer or it mai have becom
necessari that male should be born nor can we in such case
refrain from wonder at the ingeni economi the uner
harmoni convict with which the bee will pass from the small
to the larg from the larg to the small from perfect symmetri to
where unavoid it veri revers return to ideal regular
so soon as the law of a live geometri will allow and all the time
not lose a cell not suffer a singl on of their numer
structur to be sacrif to be ridicul uncertain or
barbar or ani section thereof to becom unfit for us but i
fear that i have alreadi wander into mani detail that will have
but slender interest for the reader whose ey perhap mai never
have follow a flight of bee or who mai have regard them onli
with the pass interest with which we ar all of us apt to regard
the flower the bird or the preciou stone ask of these no more
than a slight superfici assur and forget that the most
trivial secret of the nonhuman object we behold in natur connect
more close perhap with the profound enigma of our origin and our
end than the secret of those of our passion that we studi the most
eagerli and the most passion
60
and i will pass over tooin my desir that thi essai shall not
becom too didacticth remark instinct that induc the bee
at time to thin and demolish the extrem of their comb when
these ar to be enlarg or lengthen though it must be admit
that in thi case the blind build instinct fail signal to
account for their demolish in order that thei mai rebuild or
undo what ha been done that it mai be done afresh and with more
regular i will content myself also with a mere refer to the
remark experi that enabl us with the aid of a piec of
glass to compel the bee to start their comb at a right angl
when thei most ingeni contriv that the enlarg cell on the
convex side shall coincid with the reduc cell on the concav
side of the comb
but befor final quit thi subject let us paus though it be
but for an instant and consid the mysteri fashion in which
thei manag to act in concert and combin their labour when
simultan carv two opposit side of a comb and unabl
therefor to see each other take a finish comb to the light fix
your ey on the diaphan wax you will see most clearli
design an entir network of sharpli cut prism a whole system of
concord so infal that on might almost believ them to be
stamp on steel
i wonder whether those who never have seen the interior of a hive
can form an adequ concept of the arrang and aspect of the
comb let them imaginew will take a peasant hive where the
bee is left entir to it own resourceslet them imagin a dome
of straw or osier divid from top to bottom by five six eight
sometim ten strip of wax resembl somewhat great slice of
bread that run in strictli parallel line from the top of the dome
to the floor espous close the shape of the ovoid wall
between these strip is contriv a space of about half an inch to
enabl the bee to stand and to pass each other at the moment when
thei begin to construct on of these strip at the top of the hive
the waxen wall which is it rough model and will later be thin
and extend is still veri thick and complet exclud the fifti
or sixti bee at work on it inner face from the fifti or sixti
simultan engag in carv the outer so that it is wholli
imposs for on group to see the other unless inde their sight
be abl to penetr opaqu matter and yet there is not a hole that
is scoop on the inner surfac not a fragment of wax that is
ad but correspond with mathemat precis to a protuber
or caviti on the outer surfac and vice versa how doe thi
happen how is it that on doe not dig too deep anoth not deep
enough whenc the invari magic coincid between the angl
of the lozeng what is it tell the bee that at thi point thei
must begin and at that point stop onc again we must content
ourselv with the repli that is no repli it is a mysteri of the
hive
huber ha sought to explain thi mysteri by suggest that the
pressur of the bee hook and teeth mai possibl produc slight
project at regular interv on the opposit side of the comb
or that thei mai be abl to estim the thick of the block by
the flexibl elast or some other physic qualiti of the
wax or again that their antenna which seem so well adapt for
the question of the finer less evid side of thing mai serv
as a compass in the invis or lastli that the posit of
everi cell mai deriv mathemat from the arrang and
dimens of the cell on the first row and thu dispens with the
need for further measur but these explan ar evid
insuffici the first ar mere hypothes that cannot be verifi
the other do no more than transplant the mysteri and us as it
mai be to transplant mysteri as often as we possibl can it were
not wise to imagin that a mysteri ha ceas to be becaus we have
shift it home
61
now let us leav these dreari build ground thi geometr
desert of cell the comb have been start and ar becom
habit though it be here the infinit littl that without
appar hope add itself to the infinit littl though our ey
with it limit vision look and see noth the work of wax

dure the slight spasm that visibl accompani the emiss of an

worker deal out is nice proport to the abund of flower
to the spoil brought back by those who visit the calyc here
then as everywher els in the world on part of the circl is
wrap in dark here as everywher it is from without from
an unknown power that the suprem order issu and the bee like
ourselv obei the nameless lord of the wheel that incessantli
turn on itself and crush the will that have set it in motion
some littl time back i conduct a friend to on of my hive of
glass and show him the movement of thi wheel which wa as
readili percept as the great wheel of a clock show him in
all it bare the univers agit on everi comb the

full well that it is not thei alon that we ar strive to see not

a pitiabl form of the great power that quicken us also
sad let it be as all thing in natur ar sad when our ey rest

we have seen that the worker when free for the moment from the
threaten fecund of the queen hasten to erect cell for
provis whose construct is more econom and capac
greater we have seen too that the queen prefer to lai in the
smaller cell for which she is incessantli clamour when these
ar want howev or till thei be provid she resign herself
to lai her egg in the larg cell she find on her road
these egg though absolut ident with those from which
worker ar hatch will give birth to male or drone now
convers to what take place when a worker is turn into queen
it is here neither the form nor the capac of the cell that
produc thi chang for from an egg laid in a larg cell and
afterward transfer to that of a worker a most difficult
oper becaus of the microscop minut and extrem
fragil of the egg but on that i have four or five time
successfulli accomplish there will issu an undeni male
though more or less atrophi it follow therefor that the queen
must possess the power while lai of know or determin the
sex of the egg and of adapt it to the cell over which she is
bend she will rare make a mistak how doe she contriv from
among the myriad egg her ovari contain to separ male from
femal and lower them at will into the uniqu oviduct
here yet again there confront us an enigma of the hive and in
thi case on of the most unfathom we know that the virgin
queen is not steril but the egg that she lai will produc onli
male it is not till after the impregn of the nuptial flight
that she can produc worker or drone at will the nuptial flight
place her perman in possess till death of the spermatozoa
torn from her unfortun lover these spermatozoa whose number dr
leuckart estim at twentyf million ar preserv aliv in a
special gland known as the spermatheca that is situat under the
ovari at the entranc to the common oviduct it is imagin that
the narrow apertur of the smaller cell and the manner in which
the form of thi apertur compel the queen to bend forward
exercis a certain pressur upon the spermatheca in consequ of
which the spermatozoa spring forth and fecund the egg as it
pass in the larg cell thi pressur would not take place and
the spermatheca would therefor not open other again believ
that the queen ha perfect control over the muscl that open and
close the spermatheca on the vagina and these muscl ar certainli
veri numer complex and power for myself i inclin to the
second of these hypothes though i do not for a moment pretend to
decid which is the more correct for inde the further we go and
the more close we studi the more plainli is it brought home to us
that we mere ar waif shipwreck on the ocean of natur and
ever and anon from a sudden wave that shall be more transpar
than other there leap forth a fact that in an instant confound
all we imagin we knew but the reason of my prefer the second
theori is that for on thing the experi of a bordeaux
beekeep m drori have shown that in case where all the larg
cell have been remov from the hive the mother will not hesit
when the moment for lai male egg ha come to deposit these in
worker cell and that invers she will lai worker egg in
cell provid for male if she have no other at her dispos
and further we learn from the interest observ of m fabr
on the osmia which ar wild and olitari bee of the gastrilegida
famili that not onli doe the osmia know in advanc the sex of the
egg she will lai but that thi sex is option for the mother who
decid it in accord with the space of which she dispos thi
space be often govern by chanc and not to be modifi and she
will deposit a male egg here and a femal there i shall not enter
into the detail of the great french entomologist experi for
thei ar exceedingli minut and would take us too far but
whichev be the hypothesi we prefer to accept either will serv
to explain the queen inclin to lai her egg in worker
cell without it be necessari to credit her with the least
concern for the futur
it is not imposs that thi slavemoth whom we ar inclin to
piti mai be inde a great amorist a great voluptuari deriv a
certain enjoy an aftertast as it were of her on
marriageflight from the union of the male and femal principl
that thu come to pass in her be here again natur never so
ingeni so cunningli prudent and divers as when contriv her
snare of love will not have fail to provid a certain pleasur
as a bait in the interest of the speci and yet let us paus for a
moment and not becom the dupe of our own explan for inde
to attribut an idea of thi kind to natur and regard that as
suffici is like fling a stone into an unfathom gulf we
mai find in the depth of a grotto and imagin that the sound it
creat as it fall shall answer our everi question or reveal to us
aught besid the immens of the abyss
when we sai to ourselv thi thing is of natur devis
she ha ordain thi marvel those ar her desir that we see
befor us the fact is mere that our special attent ha been
drawn to some tini manifest of life upon the boundless surfac
of matter that we deem inact and choos to describ with
evid inaccuraci as nothing and death a pure fortuit
chain of event ha allow thi special manifest to attract
our attent but a thousand other no less interest perhap
and inform with no less intellig have vanish not meet
with a like goodfortun and have lost for ever the chanc of
excit our wonder it were rash to affirm aught besid and all
that remain our reflect our obstin search for the final
caus our admir and hopesal these in truth ar no more than
our feebl cry as in the depth of the unknown we clash against
what is more unknow still and thi feebl cry declar the
highest degre of individu exist attain for us on thi
mute and impenetr surfac even as the flight of the condor the
song of the nightingal reveal to them the highest degre of
exist their speci allow but the evoc of thi feebl
cry whenev opportun offer is none the less on of our most
unmistak duti nor should we let ourselv be discourag by
it appar futil

here let us close our hive where we find that life is reassum
it circular movement is extend and multipli to be again
divid as soon as it shall attain the ful of it happi and
strength and let us for the last time reopen the motherc and
see what is happen there after the departur of the swarm
the tumult have subsid the hapless citi that two third of her
children have abandon for ever becom feebl empti moribund
like a bodi from which the blood ha been drain some thousand of
bee have remain howev and these though a trifl languid
perhap ar still immov faith to the duti a precis destini

best thei can the place of those who have gone remov all trace of
the orgi carefulli hous the provis that have escap pillag
salli forth to the flower again and keep scrupul guard over the
hostag of the futur
and for all that the moment mai appear gloomi hope abound wherev
the ey mai turn we might be in on of the castl of german
legend whose wall ar compos of myriad phial contain the
soul of men about to be born for we ar in the abod of life that
goe befor life on all side asleep in their close seal
cradl in thi infinit superposit of marvel sixsid

as yet i believ been abl to divin
a few dai more and the lid of these myriad urnswhereof a

break and two larg and earnest black ey will appear surmount
by antenna that alreadi ar grope at life while activ jaw ar
busili engag in enlarg the open from within the nurs at
onc come run thei help the young bee to emerg from her
prison thei clean her and brush her and at the tip of their tongu
present the first honei of the new life but the bee that ha come
from anoth world is bewild still trembl and pale she
wear the feebl look of a littl old man who might have escap
from hi tomb or perhap of a travel strewn with the powderi
dust of the wai that lead unto life she is perfect howev from
head to foot she know at onc all that ha to be known and like
the children of the peopl who learn as it were at their birth
that for them there shall never be time to plai or to laugh she
instantli make her wai to the cell that ar close and proce
to beat her wing and to danc in cadenc so that she in her turn
mai quicken her buri sister nor doe she for on instant paus
to deciph the astound enigma of her destini or her race
65
the most arduou labour will howev at first be spare her a
week must elaps from the dai of her birth befor she will quit the
hive she will then perform her first cleans flight and absorb
the air into her trachea which fill expand her bodi and
proclaim her the bride of space thereupon she return to the hive
and wait yet on week more and then with her sister born the
same dai as herself she will for the first time set forth to visit
the flower a special emot now will lai hold of her on that
french apiarist term the soleil dartific but which might more
rightli perhap be call the sun of disquiet for it is evid
that the bee ar afraid that these daughter of the crowd of
seclud dark shrink from the vault of blue from the infinit
loneli of the light and their joi is halt and woven of
terror thei cross the threshold and paus thei depart thei
return twenti time thei hover aloft in the air their head
persist turn to the home thei describ great soar circl
that suddenli sink beneath the weight of regret and their thirteen
thousand ey will question reflect and retain the tree and the
fountain the gate and the wall the neighbour window and
hous till at last the aerial cours whereon their return shall
glide have becom as indel stamp in their memori as though it
were mark in space by two line of steel
66
a new mysteri confront us here which we shall do well to
challeng for though it repli not it silenc still will extend
the field of our consciou ignor which is the most fertil of
all that our activ know how do the bee contriv to find their
wai back to the hive that thei cannot possibl see that is hidden
perhap by the tree that in ani event must form an impercept
point in space how is it that if taken in a box to a spot two or
three mile from their home thei will almost invari succe in
find their wai back
do obstacl offer no barrier to their sight do thei guid
themselv by certain indic and landmark or do thei possess
that peculiar imperfectli understood sens that we ascrib to the
swallow and pigeon for instanc and term the sens of
direct the experi of j h fabr of lubbock and abov
all of roman natur 29 oct 1886 seem to establish that it is
not thi strang instinct that guid them i have on the other
hand more than onc notic that thei appear to pai no attent to
the colour or form of the hive thei ar attract rather by the
ordinari appear of the platform on which their home repos by
the posit of the entranc and of the alightingboard but thi
even is mere subsidiari were the front of the hive to be alter
from top to bottom dure the worker absenc thei would still
unhesitatingli direct their cours to it from out the far depth of
the horizon and onli when confront by the unrecognis
threshold would thei seem for on instant to paus such
experi as lie in our power point rather to their guid
themselv by an extraordinarili minut and precis appreci of
landmark it is not the hive that thei seem to rememb but it
posit calcul to the minutest fraction in it relat to
neighbour object and so marvel is thi appreci so
mathemat certain so profoundli inscrib in their memori
that if after five month hibern in some obscur cellar the
hive when replac on the platform should be set a littl to right
or to left of it former posit all the worker on their return
from the earliest flower will infal steer their direct and
unwav cours to the precis spot that it fill the previou
year and onli after some hesit and grope will thei discov
the door which stand not now where it onc had stood it is as
though space had precious preserv the whole winter through the
indel track of their flight as though the print of their tini
labori footstep still lai graven in the sky
if the hive be displac therefor mani bee will lose their wai
except in the case of their have been carri far from their
former home and find the countri complet transform that
thei had grown to know perfectli within a radiu of two or three
mile for then if care be taken to warn them by mean of a littl
gangwai connect with the alightingboard at the entranc to the
hive that some chang ha occur thei will at onc proce to
seek new bear and creat fresh landmark
67
and now let us return to the citi that is be repeopl where
myriad cradl ar incessantli open and the solid wall even
appear to be move but thi citi still lack a queen seven or
eight curiou structur aris from the centr of on of the comb
and remind us scatter as thei ar over the surfac of the
ordinari cell of the circl and protuber that appear so
strang on the photograph of the moon thei ar a speci of
capsul contriv of wrinkl wax or of inclin gland
hermet seal which fill the place of three or four worker
cell as a rule thei ar group around the same point and a
numer guard keep watch with singular vigil and restless
over thi region that seem instinct with an indescrib prestig
it is here that the mother ar form in each on of these
capsul befor the swarm depart an egg will be place by the
mother or more probablythough as to thi we have no certain
knowledgebi on of the worker an egg that she will have taken
from some neighbour cell and that is absolut ident with
those from which worker ar hatch
from thi egg after three dai a small larva will issu and
receiv a special and veri abund nourish and henceforth we
ar abl to follow step by step the movement of on of those
magnific vulgar method of natur on which were we deal
with men we should bestow the august name of fatal the littl
larva thank to thi regimen assum an except develop
and in it idea no less than in it bodi there ensu so
consider a chang that the bee to which it will give birth might
almost belong to an entir differ race of insect
four or five year will be the period of her life instead of the
six or seven week of the ordinari worker her abdomen will be twice
as long her colour more golden and clearer her sting will be
curv and her ey have seven or eight thousand facet instead of
twelv or thirteen thousand her brain will be smaller but she will
possess enorm ovari and a special organ besid the
spermatheca that will render her almost an hermaphrodit none of
the instinct will be her that belong to a life of toil she will
have no brush no pocket wherein to secret the wax no basket
to gather the pollen the habit the passion that we regard as
inher in the bee will all be lack in her she will not crave
for air or the light of the sun she will die without even onc
have tast a flower her exist will pass in the shadow in
the midst of a restless throng her sole occup the
indefatig search for cradl that she must fill on the other
hand she alon will know the disquiet of love not even twice it
mai be in her life shall she look on the lightfor the departur
of the swarm is by no mean inevit on on occas onli
perhap will she make us of her wing but then it will be to fly
to her lover it is strang to see so mani thingsorgan idea
desir habit an entir destinydepend not on a germ which
were the ordinari miracl of the plant the anim and man but on
a curiou inert substanc a drop of honei
it is gener admit todai that worker and queen
after the hatch of the egg receiv the same
nourishmenta kind of milk veri rich in nitrogen that a
special gland in the nurs head secret but after a few
dai the worker larva ar wean and put on a coarser diet
of honei and pollen wherea the futur queen until she be
fulli develop is copious fed on the preciou milk known
as royal jelli
68
about a week ha pass sinc the departur of the old queen the
royal nymph asleep in the capsul ar not all of the same ag for
it is to the interest of the bee that the birth should be nice
gradat and take place at regular interv in accord with
their possibl desir for a second swarm a third or even a fourth
the worker have for some hour now been activ thin the wall
of the ripest cell while the young queen from within ha been
simultan gnaw the round lid of her prison and at last
her head appear she thrust herself forward and with the help of
the guardian who hasten eagerli to her who brush her caress her
and clean her she extric herself altogeth and take her first
step on the comb at the moment of birth she too like the worker
is trembl and pale but after ten minut or so her leg becom
stronger and a strang restless seiz her she feel that she
is not alon that her kingdom ha yet to be conquer that close
by pretend ar hide and she eagerli pace the waxen wall in
search of her rival but there interven here the mysteri
decis and wisdom of instinct of the spirit of the hive or of
the assembl of worker the most surpris featur of all as we
watch these thing happen befor us in a hive of glass is the
entir absenc of hesit of the slightest divis of opinion
there is not a trace of discuss or discord the atmospher of the
citi is on of absolut unanim preordain which reign over
all and everi on of the bee would appear to know in advanc the
thought of her sister and yet thi moment is the gravest the most
vital in their entir histori thei have to choos between three or
four cours whose result in the distant futur will be total
differ which too the slightest accid mai render disastr
thei have to reconcil the multipl of specieswhich is their
passion or innat dutywith the preserv of the hive and it
peopl thei will err at time thei will success send forth
three or four swarm therebi complet denud the motherc
and these swarm too feebl to organis will succumb it mai be
at the approach of winter caught unawar by thi climat of our
which is differ far from their origin climat that the bee
notwithstand all have never forgotten in such case thei suffer
from what is known as swarm fever a condit wherein life as
in ordinari fever react too ardent on itself pass it aim
complet the circl and discov onli death
69
of all the decis befor them there is none that would seem
imper nor can man if content to plai the part of spectat
onli foretel in the slightest degre which on the bee will
adopt but that the most care deliber govern their choic
is prove by the fact that we ar abl to influenc or even
determin it by for instanc reduc or enlarg the space we
accord them or by remov comb full of honei and set up in
their stead empti comb which ar well suppli with worker
cell
the question thei have to consid is not whether a second or third
swarm shall be immedi launchedfor in arriv at such a
decis thei would mere be blindli and thoughtlessli yield to
the capric or temptat of a favour momentbut the
instantan unanim adopt of measur that shall enabl them
to issu a second swarm or cast three or four dai after the birth
of the first queen and a third swarm three dai after the departur
of the second with thi first queen at their head it must be
admit therefor that we discov here a perfectli reason
system and a matur combin of plan extend over a period
consider inde when compar with the breviti of the bee
exist
these measur concern the care of the youth queen who still lie
immur in their waxen prison let us assum that the spirit of
the hive ha pronounc against the despatch of a second swarm two
cours still remain open the bee mai permit the firstborn of the
royal virgin the on whose birth we have wit to destroi her
sisterenemi or thei mai elect to wait till she have perform
the peril ceremoni known as the nuptial flight whereon the
nation futur depend the immedi massacr will be authoris
often and often deni but in the latter case it is of cours not
easi for us to pronounc whether the bee decis be due to a
desir for a second swarm or to their recognit of the danger
attend the nuptial flight for it will happen at time that on
account of the weather unexpectedli becom less favour or for
some other reason we cannot divin thei will suddenli chang their
mind renounc the cast that thei had decre and destroi the royal
progeni thei had so carefulli preserv but at present we will
suppos that thei have determin to dispens with a second swarm
and that thei accept the risk of the nuptial flight our young
queen hasten toward the larg cradl urg on by her great
desir and the guard make wai befor her listen onli to her
furiou jealousi she will fling herself on to the first cell she
come across madli strip off the wax with her teeth and claw tear
awai the cocoon that carpet the cell and divest the sleep
princess of everi cover if her rival should be alreadi
recognis the queen will turn so that her sting mai enter the
capsul and will frantic stab it with her venom weapon until
the victim perish she then becom calmer appeas by the death
that put a term to the hatr of everi creatur she withdraw her
sting hurri to the adjoin cell attack it and open it
pass it by should she find in it onli an imperfect larva or
nymph nor doe she paus till at last exhaust and breathless
her claw and teeth glide harmless over the waxen wall
the bee that surround her have calmli watch her furi have stood
by inact move onli to leav her path clear but no sooner ha
a cell been pierc and laid wast than thei eagerli flock to it
drag out the corps of the ravish nymph or the still live
larva and thrust it forth from the hive thereupon gorg
themselv with the preciou royal jelli that adher to the side
of the cell and final when the queen ha becom too weak to
persist in her passion thei will themselv complet the massacr
of the innoc and the sovereign race and their dwell will
all disappear
thi is the terribl hour of the hive the onli occas with that
of the more justifi execut of the drone when the worker
suffer discord and death to be busi amongst them and here as often
in natur it is the favour of love who attract to themselv the
most extraordinari shaft of violent death
it will happen at time that two queen will be hatch
simultan the occurr be rare howev for the bee
take special care to prevent it but whenev thi doe take place
the deadli combat will begin the moment thei emerg from their
cradl and of thi combat huber wa the first to remark an
extraordinari featur each time it would seem that the queen in
their pass present their chitrin cuirass to each other in
such a fashion that the draw of the sting would prove mutual
fatal on might almost believ that even as a god or goddess wa
wont to interpos in the combat of the iliad so a god or a
goddess the divin of the race perhap interpos here and the
two warrior stricken with simultan terror divid and fly to
meet shortli after and separ again should the doubl disast
onc more menac the futur of their peopl till at last on of
them shall succe in surpris her clumsier or less wari rival
and in kill her without risk to herself for the law of the race
ha call for on sacrific onli
the cradl have thu been destroi and the rival all slain the
young queen is accept by her peopl but she will not truli reign
over them or be treat as wa her mother befor her until the
nuptial flight be accomplish for until she be impregn the
bee will hold her but lightli and render most pass homag her
histori howev will rare be as unev as thi for the bee
will not often renounc their desir for a second swarm in that
case as befor quick with the same desir the queen will
approach the royal cell but instead of meet with docil
servant who second her effort she will find her path block by a
numer and hostil guard in her furi and urg on by her fix
idea she will endeavour to forc her wai through or to outflank
them but everywher sentinel ar post to protect the sleep
princess she persist she return to the charg to be repuls
with ever increas sever to be somewhat roughli handl even
until at last she begin vagu to understand that these littl
inflex worker stand for a law befor which that law must bend
wherebi she is inspir
and at last she goe and wander from comb to comb her unsatisfi
wrath find vent in a warsong or angri complaint that everi
beekeep know resembl somewhat the note of a distant trumpet
of silver so intens in it passion feebl as to be
clearli audibl in the even especi two or three yard from
the doubl wall of the most carefulli enclos hive
upon the worker thi royal cry ha a magic effect it terrifi
them it induc a kind of respect stupor and when the queen
send it forth as she halt in front of the cell whose approach is
deni her the guardian who have but thi moment been hustl
her push her back will at onc desist and wait with bent
head till the cry shall have ceas to resound inde some
believ that it is thank to the prestig of thi cry which the
sphinx atropo imit that the latter is abl to enter the hive
and gorg itself with honei without the least molest on the
part of the bee
for two or three dai sometim even for five thi indign
lament will be heard thi challeng that the queen address to her
well protect rival and as these in their turn develop in their
turn grow anxiou to see the light thei too set to work to gnaw the
lid of their cell a mighti disord would now appear to threaten
the republ but the geniu of the hive at the time that it form
it decis wa abl to foretel everi consequ that might
ensu and the guardian have had their instruct thei know
exactli what must be done hour by hour to meet the attack of a
foil instinct and conduct two opposit forc to a success
issu thei ar fulli awar that if the young queen should escap
who now clamour for birth thei would fall into the hand of their
elder sister by thi time irresist who would destroi them on
by on the worker therefor will pile on fresh layer of wax in
proport as the prison reduc from within the wall of her
tower and the impati princess will ardent persist in her
labour littl suspect that she ha to deal with an enchant
obstacl that rise ever afresh from it ruin she hear the
warcri of her rival and alreadi awar of her royal duti and
destini although she ha not yet look upon life nor know what a
hive mai be she answer the challeng from within the depth of her
prison but her cry is differ it is stifl and hollow for it
ha to travers the wall of a tomb and when night is fall and
nois ar hush and high over all there reign the silenc of the
star the apiarist who near these marvel citi and stand
question at their entranc recognis and understand the
dialogu that is pass between the wander queen and the virgin
in prison
72
to the young princess howev thi prolong reclus is of
materi benefit for when thei at last ar freed thei have grown
matur and vigor and ar abl to fly but dure thi period of
wait the strength of the first queen ha also increas and is
suffici now to enabl her to face the peril of the voyag the
time ha arriv therefor for the departur of the second swarm
or cast with the firstborn of the queen at it head no sooner
ha she gone than the worker left in the hive will set on of the
prison free and she will evinc the same murder desir send
forth the same cri of anger until at last after three or four
dai she will leav the hive in her turn at the head of the
tertiari swarm and so in success in the case of swarm
fever till the motherc shall be complet exhaust
swammerdam cite a hive that through it swarm and the swarm of
it swarm wa abl in a singl season to found no less than thirti
coloni
such extraordinari multipl is abov all notic after
disastr winter and on might almost believ that the bee
forev in touch with the secret desir of natur ar consciou of
the danger that menac their race but at ordinari time thi fever
will rare occur in a strong and wellgovern hive there ar mani
that swarm onli onc and some inde not at all
after the second swarm the bee as a rule will renounc further
divis ow either to their have observ the excess
feebl of their own stock or to the prudenc urg upon them by
threaten ski in that case thei will allow the third queen to
slaughter the captiv ordinari life will at onc be resum and
pursu with the more ardour for the reason that the worker ar all
veri young that the hive is depopul and impoverish and that
there ar great void to fill befor the arriv of winter
73
the departur of the second and third swarm resembl that of the
first and the condit ar ident with the except that the
bee ar fewer in number less circumspect and lack in scout
and also that the young and virgin queen be unencumb and
ardent will fly much further and in the first stage lead the swarm
to a consider distanc from the hive the conduct of these
second and third migrat will be far more rash and their futur
more problemat the queen at their head the repres of
the futur ha not yet been impregn their entir destini
depend on the ensu nuptial flight a pass bird a few drop
of rain a mistak a cold windani on of these mai give rise to
irremedi disast of thi the bee ar so well awar that when
the young queen salli forth in quest of her lover thei often will
abandon the labour thei have begun will forsak the home of a dai
that alreadi is dear to them and accompani her in a bodi dread
to let her pass out of their sight eager as thei form close
around her and shelter her beneath their myriad devot wing to
lose themselv with her should love caus her to strai so far from
the hive that the as yet unfamiliar road of return shall grow
blur and hesit in everi memori
74
but so potent is the law of the futur that none of these
uncertainti these peril of death will caus a singl bee to
waver the enthusiasm displai by the second and third swarm is
not less than that of the first no sooner ha the motherc
pronounc it decis than a battalion of worker will flock
around each danger young queen eager to follow her fortun to
accompani her on the voyag where there is so much to lose and so
littl to gain beyond the desir of a satisfi instinct whenc do
thei deriv the energi we ourselv never possess wherebi thei
break with the past as though with an enemi who is it select from
the crowd those who shall go forth and declar who shall remain
no special class divid those who stai from those who wander
abroad it will be the younger here and the elder there around each
queen who shall never return veteran forag jostl tini worker
who for the first time shall face the dizzi of the blue nor is
the proportion strength of a swarm control by chanc or
accid by the momentari deject or transport of an instinct
thought or feel i have more than onc tri to establish a
relat between the number of bee compos a swarm and the number
of those that remain and although the difficulti of thi
calcul ar such as to preclud anyth approach
mathemat precis i have at least been abl to gather that
thi relationif we take into account the broodcel or in other
word the forthcom birthsi suffici constant to point to
an actual and mysteri reckon on the part of the geniu of the
hive
75
we will not follow these swarm on their numer and often most
complic adventur two swarm at time will join forc at
other two or three of the imprison queen will profit by the
confus attend the moment of departur to elud the
watch of their guardian and join the group that ar
form occasion too on of the young queen find herself
surround by male will caus herself to be impregn in the
swarm flight and will then drag all her peopl to an
extraordinari height and distanc in the practic of apicultur
these secondari and tertiari swarm ar alwai return to the
motherh the queen will meet on the comb the worker will
gather around and watch their combat and when the stronger ha
overcom the weaker thei will then in their ardour for work and
hatr of disord expel the corps close the door on the
violenc of the futur forget the past return to their cell and
resum their peac path to the flower that await them
76
we will now in order to simplifi matter return to the queen whom
the bee have permit to slaughter her sister and resum the
account of her adventur as i have alreadi state thi massacr
will be often prevent and often sanction at time even when
the bee appar do not intend to issu a second swarm for we
notic the same divers of polit spirit in the differ hive
of an apiari as in the differ human nation of a contin but
it is clear that the bee will act imprud in give their
consent for if the queen should die or strai in the nuptial
flight it will be imposs to fill her place the worker larva
have pass the ag when thei ar suscept of royal
transform let us assum howev that the imprud ha been
commit and behold our firstborn therefor uniqu sovereign
and recognis as such in the spirit of her peopl but she is still
a virgin to becom as wa the mother befor her it is essenti
that she should meet the male within the first twenti dai of her
life should the event for some reason be delai beyond thi
period her virgin becom irrevoc and yet we have seen that
she is not steril virgin though she be there confront us here
the great mysteryor precautionof natur that is known as
parthenogenesi and is common to a certain number of insect such
as the aphid the lepidoptera of the psych genu the hymenoptera
of the cyniped famili etc the virgin queen is abl to lai but
from all the egg that she will deposit in the cell be these larg
or small there will issu male alon and as these never work as
thei live at the expens of the femal as thei never go forag
except on their own account and ar gener incap of
provid for their subsist the result will be at the end of
some week that the last exhaust worker will perish and the
coloni be ruin and total annihil the queen we have said
will produc thousand of drone and each of these will possess
million of the spermatozoa whereof it is imposs that a singl
on can have penetr into the organ of the mother that mai
not be more astound perhap than a thousand other and analog
phenomena and inde when we consid these problem and more
especi those of gener the marvel and the unexpect
confront us so constantlyoccur far more frequent and abov
all in far less human fashion than in the most miracul fairi
storiesthat after a time astonish becom so habitu with us
that we almost ceas to wonder the fact howev is suffici
curiou to be worthi of notic but on the other hand how shall we
explain to ourselv the aim that natur can have in thu favour
the valueless drone at the cost of the worker who ar so
essenti is she afraid lest the femal might perhap be induc
by their intellect unduli to limit the number of their parasit
which destruct though thei be ar still necessari for the
preserv of the race or is it mere an exagger reaction
against the misfortun of the unfruit queen can we have here on
of those blind and extrem precaut which ignor the caus of
the evil overstep the remedi and in the endeavour to prevent an
unfortun accid bring about a catastroph in realitythough
we must not forget that the natur primit realiti is differ
from that of the present for in the origin forest the coloni
might well be far more scatter than thei ar todayin realiti
the queen unfruit will rare be due to the want of male
for these ar veri numer alwai and will flock from afar but
rather to the rain or the cold that will have kept her too long in
the hive and more frequent still to the imperfect state of her
wing wherebi she will be prevent from describ the high flight
in the air that the organ of the male demand natur howev
heedless of these more intrins caus is so deepli concern with
the multipl of male that we sometim find in motherless
hive two or three worker possess of so great a desir to
preserv the race that their atrophi ovari notwithstand
thei will still endeavour to lai and their organ expand
somewhat beneath the empir of thi exasper sentiment thei will
succe in deposit a few egg in the cell but from these egg
as from those of the virgin mother there will issu onli male
77
here we behold the activ intervent of a superior though perhap
imprud will which offer irresist obstruct to the
intellig will of a life in the insect world such intervent
ar compar frequent and much can be gain from their studi
for thi world be more dens peopl and more complex than
other certain special desir of natur ar often more palpabl
reveal to us there and she mai even at time be detect in the
midst of experi we might almost be warrant in regard as
incomplet she ha on great and gener desir for instanc that
she displai on all side the amelior of each speci through
the triumph of the stronger thi struggl as a rule is most
carefulli organis the hecatomb of the weak is enorm but that
matter littl so long as the victor reward be effectu and
certain but there ar case when on might almost imagin that
natur had not had time enough to disentangl her combin
case where reward is imposs and the fate of the victor no less
disastr than that of the vanquish and of such select an
instanc that will not take us too far from our bee i know of no
instanc more strike than that of the triongulin of the sitari
collet and it will be seen that in mani detail thi stori is
less foreign to the histori of man than might perhap be imagin
these triongulin ar the primari larva of a parasit proper to a
wild obtusetongu solitari bee the collet which build it
nest in subterranean galleri it is their habit to lie in wait for
the bee at the approach to these galleri and then to the number
of three four five or often of more thei will leap on her back
and buri themselv in her hair were the struggl of the weak
against the strong to take place at thi moment there would be no
more to be said and all would pass in accord with univers
law but for a reason we know not their instinct requir and
natur ha consequ ordain that thei should hold themselv
tranquil so long as thei remain on the back of the bee thei
patient bide their time while she visit the flower and
construct and provis her cell but no sooner ha an egg been
laid than thei all spring upon it and the innoc collet
carefulli seal down her cell which she ha duli suppli with
food never suspect that she ha at the same time ensur the
death of her offspr
the cell ha scarc been close when the triongulin group round
the egg engag in the inevit and salutari combat of natur
select the stronger more agil will seiz it adversari
beneath the cuirass and rais it aloft will maintain it for
hour in it mandibl until the victim expir but while thi
fight is in progress anoth of the triongulin that had either no
rival to meet or alreadi ha conquer take possess of the egg
and burst it open the ultim victor ha therefor thi fresh
enemi to subdu but the conquest is easi for the triongulin deep
in the satisfact of it prenat hunger cling obstin to
the egg and doe not even attempt to defend itself it is quickli
despatch and the other is at last alon and possessor of the
preciou egg it ha won so well it eagerli plung it head into
the open it predecessor had made and begin the lengthi repast
that shall transform it into a perfect insect but natur that ha
decre thi ordeal of battl ha on the other hand establish
the prize of victori with such miserli precis that noth short
of an entir egg will suffic for the nourish of a singl
triongulin so that as we ar inform by m mayet to whom we ow
the account of these disconcert adventur there is lack to
our conqueror the food it last victim consum befor death and
incap therefor of achiev the first stage of it
transform it di in it turn adher to the skin of the
egg or ad itself in the sugari liquid to the number of the
drown
78
thi case though rare to be follow so close is not uniqu in
natur histori we have here laid bare befor us the struggl
between the consciou will of the triongulin that seek to live
and the obscur and gener will of natur that not onli desir
that the triongulin should live but is anxiou even that it life
should be improv and fortifi to a degre beyond that to which
it own will impel it but through some strang inadvert the
amelior natur impos suppress the life of even the fittest
and the sitari collet would have long sinc disappear had not
chanc act in opposit to the desir of natur permit
isol individu to escap from the excel and farse law
that ordain on all side the triumph of the stronger
can thi mighti power err then that seem unconsci to us but
necessarili wise see that the life she organis and maintain
is forev prove her to be right can feebl at time overcom
that suprem reason which we ar apt to invok when we have
attain the limit of our own and if that be so by whom shall
thi feebl be set right
but let us return to that special form of her resistless
intervent that we find in parthenogenesi and we shall do well
to rememb that remot as the world mai seem in which these
problem confront us thei do inde yet concern ourselv veri
nearli who would dare to affirm that no intervent take place in
the sphere of manintervent that mai be more hidden but not
the less fraught with danger and in the case befor us which is
right in the endth insect or natur what would happen if the
bee more docil perhap or endow with a higher intellig
were too clearli to understand the desir of natur and to follow
them to the extrem to multipli male to infin see that
natur is imperi call for male would thei not risk the
destruct of their speci ar we to believ that there ar
intent in natur that it is danger to understand too clearli
fatal to follow with too much ardour and that it is on of her
desir that we should not divin and follow all her desir is
it not possibl that herein there mai lie on of the peril of the
human race we too ar awar of unconsci forc within us that
would appear to demand the revers of what our intellect urg and
thi intellect of our that as a rule it own boundari reach
know not whither to gocan it be well that it should join itself
to these forc and add to them it unexpect weight
79
have we the right to conclud from the danger of parthenogenesi
that natur is not alwai abl to proport the mean to the end
and that what she intend to preserv is preserv at time by mean
of precaut she ha to contriv against her own precaut and
often through foreign circumst she ha not herself foreseen
but is there anyth she doe forese anyth she doe intend to
preserv natur some mai sai is a word wherewith we cloth the
unknow and few thing authoris our credit it with
intellig or with aim that is true we touch here the
hermet seal vase that furnish our concept of the
univers reluct over and over again to label these with the
inscript unknown that dishearten us and compel us to
silenc we engrav upon them in the degre of their size and
grandeur the word natur life death infinit select
spirit of the race and mani other even as those who went befor
us affix the word god provid destini reward etc let it
be so if on will and no more but though the content of the
vase remain obscur there is gain at least in the fact that the
inscript todai convei less menac to us that we ar abl
therefor to approach them and touch them and lai our ear close to
them and listen with wholesom curios
but whatev the name we attach to these vase it is certain that
on of them at least and the greatestthat which bear on it
flank the name natureenclos a veri real forc the most real
of all and on that is abl to preserv an enorm and marvel
quantiti and qualiti of life on our globe by mean so skil that
thei surpass all that the geniu of man could contriv could thi
quantiti and qualiti be maintain by other mean is it we who
deceiv ourselv when we imagin that we see precaut where
perhap there is truli no more than a fortun chanc that ha
surviv a million unfortun chanc
80
that mai be but these fortun chanc teach us a lesson in
admir as valuabl as those we might learn in region superior
to chanc if we let our gaze travel beyond the creatur that ar
possess of a glimmer of intellect and conscious beyond the
protozoa even which ar the first nebul repres of the
dawn anim kingdom we find as ha been abundantli prove by
the experi of mr h j carter the celebr microscopist

that these must as yet be lack their poison tentacl now
the amoeba have neither a nervou system nor distinguish organ

would seem expos to everi fatalitywithout paus to consid
carnivor speci like the drusera which realli act as
animalsw ar struck by the geniu that some of our humblest
flower displai in contriv that the visit of the bee shall
infal procur them the cross fertilis thei need see the
marvel fashion in which the orchi mori our humbl countri

the mathemat and automat inclin and adhes of it
pollinia as also the uner doubl seesaw of the anther of the
wild sage which touch the bodi of the visit insect at a
particular spot in order that the insect mai in it turn touch the
stigma of the neighbour flower at anoth particular spot watch
too in the case of the pediculari sylvatica the success
calcul movement of it stigma and inde the entranc of the
bee into ani on of these three flower set everi organ vibrat
just as the skil marksman who hit the black spot on the target
will caus all the figur to move in the elabor mechan we
see in our villag fair
we might go lower still and show as ruskin ha shown in hi
ethic of the dust the charact habit and artific of
crystal their quarrel and mode of procedur when a foreign bodi
attempt to oppos their plan which ar more ancient by far than
our imagin can conceiv the manner in which thei admit or
repel an enemi the possibl victori of the weaker over the
stronger as for instanc when the allpow quartz submit to
the humbl and wili epidot and allow thi last to conquer it the
struggl terribl sometim and sometim magnific between the

uncompromis puriti of on hyalin block which reject whatev
is foul and the sickli growth the evid immor of it
brother which admit corrupt and writh miser in the void
as we might quot also the strang phenomena of crystallin
cicatris and reintegr mention by claud bernard etc
but the mysteri here becom too foreign to us let us keep to our
flower which ar the last express of a life that ha yet some
kinship with our own we ar not deal now with anim or
insect to which we attribut a special intellig will thank
to which thei surviv we believ rightli or wrongli that the
flower possess no such will at least we cannot discov in them
the slightest trace of the organ wherein will intellect and
initi of action ar usual born and resid it follow
therefor that all that act in them in so admir a fashion must
directli proce from what we elsewher call natur we ar no
longer concern with the intellect of the individu here we find
the un consciou undivid forc in the act of ensnar other
form of itself shall we on that account refus to believ that
these snare ar pure accid occur in accord with a
routin that is also incident we ar not yet entitl to such a
deduct it might be urg that these flower had these
miracul combin not been would not have surviv but would
have had their place fill by other that stood in no need of
cross fertilis and the nonexist of the first would have
been perceiv by none nor would the life that vibrat on the
earth have seem less incomprehens to us less divers or less
astound
and yet it would be difficult not to admit that act which bear all
the appear of act of intellig and prudenc produc and
support these fortun chanc whenc do thei issuefrom the
be itself or from the forc whenc that be draw life i will
not sai it matter but littl for on the contrari to know the
answer were of suprem import to us but in the meantim and
till we shall learn whether it be the flower that endeavour to
maintain and perfect the life that natur ha place within it or
whether it be natur that put forth an effort to maintain and
improv the degre of exist the flower ha assum or final
whether it be chanc that ultim govern chanc a multitud of
semblanc invit us to believ that someth equal to our loftiest
thought issu at time from a common sourc that we ar compel
to admir without know where it resid
there ar moment when what seem error to us come forth from thi
common sourc but although we know veri few thing proof abound
that the seem error wa in realiti an act of prudenc that we at
first could not grasp in the littl circl even that our ey
embrac we ar constantli shown that what we regard as natur
blunder close by wa due to her deem it well to adjust the
presum inadvert out yonder she ha place the three flower
we mention under condit of such difficulti that thei ar
unabl to fertilis themselv she consid it benefici
therefor for reason beyond our power of percept that thei
should caus themselv to be fertilis by their neighbour and
inasmuch as she enhanc the intellig of her victim she
displai on our right the geniu she fail to displai on our left
the bywai of thi geniu of her remain incomprehens to us but
it level is alwai the same it will appear to fall into
errorassum that error be possiblethereupon rise again at
onc in the organ charg to repair thi error turn where we mai
it tower high over our head it is the circular ocean the
tideless water whereon our boldest and most independ thought
will never be more than mere abject bubbl we call it natur
todai tomorrow perhap we shall give it anoth name softer or
more alarm in the meanwhil it hold simultan imparti
swai over life and death furnish the two irreconcil sister
with the magnific and familiar weapon that adorn and distract
it bosom
81
doe thi forc take measur to maintain what mai be struggl on
it surfac or must we sai argu in the strangest of circl
that what float on it surfac must guard itself against the geniu
that ha given it life that question must be left open we have no
mean of ascertain whether it be notwithstand the effort of
the superior will or independ of these or lastli becaus of
these that a speci ha been abl to surviv
all we can sai is that such a speci exist and that on thi
point therefor natur would seem to be right but who shall tell
us how mani other that we have not known have fallen victim to her
restless and forget intellect beyond thi we can recognis onli
the surpris and occasion hostil form that the extraordinari
fluid we call life assum in utter unconsci sometim at
other with a kind of conscious the fluid which anim us
equal with all the rest which produc the veri thought that
judg it and the feebl voic that attempt to tell it stori
vi the nuptial flight
we will now consid the manner in which the impregn of the
queenbe come to pass here again natur ha taken extraordinari
measur to favour the union of male with femal of a differ
stock a strang law whereto noth would seem to compel her a
capric or initi inadvert perhap whose repar call
for the most marvel forc her activ know
if she had devot half the geniu she lavish on cross
fertilis and other arbitrari desir to make life more
certain to allevi pain to soften death and ward off
horribl accid the univers would probabl have present an
enigma less incomprehens less pitiabl than the on we ar
strive to solv but our conscious and the interest we take
in exist must grappl not with what might have been but with
what is
around the virgin queen and dwell with her in the hive ar
hundr of exuber male forev drunk on honei the sole reason
for their exist be on act of love but notwithstand the
incess contact of two desir that elsewher invari triumph
over everi obstacl the union never take place in the hive nor
ha it been possibl to bring about the impregn of a captiv
queen
professor mclain ha recent succeed in caus a few
queen to be artifici impregn but thi ha been the
result of a verit surgic oper of the most
delic and complic natur moreov the fertil of

while she live in their midst the lover about her know not what

never suspect that thei have but thi moment quit her have
share the same comb with her have brush against her perhap in
the eager of their departur on might almost believ that
those wonder ey of their that cover their head as though with
a glitter helmet do not recognis or desir her save when she
soar in the blue each dai from noon till three when the sun

and exist afterward if you can that is no concern of mine do or

what will patient have to maintain itself by toil whoever would

with the trait we discov here would design an extraordinari
figur veri foreign to our ideal which nevertheless can onli

84
veri few i imagin have profan the secret of the queenbe
wed which come to pass in the infinit radiant circl of a
beauti sky but we ar abl to wit the hesit departur
of the brideelect and the murder return of the bride
howev great her impati she will yet choos her dai and her
hour and linger in the shadow of the portal till a marvel
morn fling open wide the nuptial space in the depth of the
great azur vault she love the moment when drop of dew still
moisten the leav and the flower when the last fragranc of dy
dawn still wrestl with burn dai like a maiden caught in the
arm of a heavi warrior when through the silenc of approach
noon is heard onc and again a transpar cry that ha linger

then she appear on the thresholdin the midst of indiffer

deliri throng of worker should it be imposs to fill her

she start her flight backward return twice or thrice to the
alightingboard and then have definit fix in her mind the

from without she depart like an arrow to the zenith of the blue
she soar to a height a lumin zone that other bee attain at no

85
most creatur have a vagu belief that a veri precari hazard a
kind of transpar membran divid death from love and that the
profound idea of natur demand that the giver of life should die at
the moment of give here thi idea whose memori linger still
over the kiss of man is realis in it primal simplic no
sooner ha the union been accomplish than the male abdomen
open the organ detach itself drag with it the mass of the
entrail the wing relax and as though struck by lightn the
empti bodi turn and turn on itself and sink down into the
abyss
the same idea that befor in parthenogenesi sacrif the
futur of the hive to the unwont multipl of male now
sacrific the male to the futur of the hive
thi idea is alwai astound and the further we penetr into

she elud us on everi side she repudi most of our rule and
break our standard to piec on our right she sink far beneath

abov them she appear to be constantli blunder no less in the

there she invest with her sanction the instinct of the obscur

mind be wrong if it ask itself whether the whole truthmor
truth therefor as well as nonmoralhad not better be sought in
thi chao than in itself where these truth would seem
compar clear and precis
the man who feel thu will never attempt to deni the reason or
virtu of hi ideal hallow by so mani hero and sage but there
ar time when he will whisper to himself that thi ideal ha
perhap been form at too great a distanc from the enorm mass
whose divers beauti it would fain repres he ha hitherto
legitim fear that the attempt to adapt hi moral to that

but todai he understand her a littl better and from some of her
repli which though still vagu reveal an unexpect breadth he
ha been enabl to seiz a glimps of a plan and an intellect
vaster than could be conceiv by hi unaid imagin wherefor
he ha grown less afraid nor feel ani longer the same imperi
need of the refug hi own special virtu and reason afford him he
conclud that what is so great could sure teach noth that
would tend to lessen itself he wonder whether the moment mai not
have arriv for submit to a more judici examin hi
convict hi principl and hi dream
onc more he ha not the slightest desir to abandon hi human
ideal that even which at first divert him from thi ideal teach
him to return to it it were imposs for natur to give ill

hi conduct by the most humanli beauti truth and cling to the

in a word he divid the moral from the intellectu order
admit in the former that onli which is greater and more

would counsel him not yet to abandon hi human ideal for the more

let us return to the tragic nuptial of the queen here it is
evid natur wish in the interest of cross fertilis
that the union of the drone and the queenbe should be possibl

she descend from the azur height and return to the hive
trail behind her like an oriflamm the unfold entrail of her

except in the case of a young queen who had gone forth at the head
of a swarm and repres the uniqu hope of a newli found and
still empti citi in that instanc the worker were all wildli
excit and rush to meet her but as a rule thei appear to forget
her even though the futur of their citi will often be no less
imperil thei act with consist prudenc in all thing till
the moment when thei authoris the massacr of the rival queen
that point reach their instinct halt and there is as it were
a gap in their foresightthei appear to be wholli indiffer
thei rais their head recognis probabl the murder token of

our expect had pictur be posit in their wai and slow

themselv to rejoic why endeavour to render too logic or too
human the feel of littl creatur so differ from ourselv
neither among the bee nor among ani other anim that have a rai

the interest of a sincer mind the aim of the observ is not to
surpris but to comprehend and to point out the gap exist in
an intellect and the sign of a cerebr organis differ
from our own is more curiou by far than the relat of mere
marvel concern it
but thi indiffer is not share by all and when the breathless
queen ha reach the alightingboard some group will form and
accompani her into the hive where the sun hero of everi festiv
in which the bee take part is enter with littl timid step

prodigi nuptial these the most fairylik that can be conceiv

with a resplend marriag or an ideal moment of love her

a prolong flight must first expand hi two great tracheal sac

there we have the whole physiolog secretwhich will seem
ordinari enough to some and almost vulgar to othersof thi
dazzl pursuit and these magnific nuptial
89
but must we alwai then the poet will wonder rejoic in
region that ar loftier than the truth
ye in all thing at all time let us rejoic not in region
loftier than the truth for that were imposs but in region
higher than the littl truth that our ey can seiz should a
chanc a recollect an illus a passionin a word should

beauti light than to other let that motiv be first of all dear
to us it mai onli be error perhap but thi error will not
prevent the moment wherein thi object appear the most admir to
us from be the moment wherein we ar likeliest to perceiv it
real beauti the beauti we lend it direct our attent to it
verit beauti and grandeur which deriv as thei ar from the
relat wherein everi object must of necess stand to gener
etern forc and law might otherwis escap observ the
faculti of admir which an illus mai have creat within us
will serv for the truth that must come be it sooner or later it
is with the word the feel and ardour creat by ancient and
imaginari beauti that human welcom todai truth which
perhap would have never been born which might not have been abl
to find so propiti a home had these sacrif illus not
first of all dwelt in and kindl the heart and the reason
whereinto these truth should descend happi the ey that need no

nearer thei draw nearer when thei admir and whatev the height
mai be whereon thei rejoic thi rejoic can never take place in

90
doe thi mean that we should attach ourselv to falsehood to an
unreal and factiti poetri and find our glad therein for want
of anyth better or that in the exampl befor usin itself
noth but we dwell on it becaus it stand for a thousand other
as also for our entir attitud in face of diver order of
truthsthat here we should ignor the physiolog explan
and retain and tast onli the emot of thi nuptial flight which
is yet and whatev the caus on of the most lyric most
beauti act of that suddenli disinterest irresist forc
which all live creatur obei and ar wont to call love that were
too childish nor is it possibl thank to the excel habit
everi loyal mind ha todai acquir
the fact be incontest we must evid admit that the
exsert of the organ is render possibl onli by the expans of
the tracheal vesicl but if we content with thi fact did not
let our ey roam beyond it if we deduc therefrom that everi
thought that rise too high or wander too far must be of necess
wrong and that truth must be look for onli in the materi
detail if we did not seek no matter where in uncertainti often
far greater than the on thi littl explan ha solv in the
strang mysteri of cross fertilis for instanc or in the
perpetu of the race and life or in the scheme of natur if we
did not seek in these for someth beyond the current explan
someth that should prolong it and conduct us to the beauti and
grandeur that repos in the unknown i would almost ventur to
assert that we should pass our exist further awai from the truth
than those even who in thi case wilfulli shut their ey to all
save the poetic and wholli imaginari interpret of these
marvel nuptial thei evid misjudg the form and colour of
the truth but thei live in it atmospher and it influenc far
more than the other who complac believ that the entir truth
li captiv within their two hand for the first have made ampl
prepar to receiv the truth have provid most hospit
lodg within them and even though their ey mai not see it thei
ar eagerli look toward the beauti and grandeur where it
resid sure must be
we know noth of natur aim which for us is the truth that
domin everi other but for the veri love of thi truth and to
preserv in our soul the ardour we need for it search it behov
us to deem it great and if we should find on dai that we have been
on a wrong road that thi aim is incoher and petti we shall
have discov it petti by mean of the veri zeal it presum
grandeur had creat within us and thi petti onc establish
it will teach us what we have to do in the meanwhil it cannot be
unwis to devot to it search the most strenuou dare effort of
our heart and our reason and should the last word of all thi be
wretch it will be no littl achiev to have laid bare the
inan and the petti of the aim of natur
there is no truth for us yet a great physiologist of our dai
remark to me onc as i walk with him in the countri there is
no truth yet but there ar everywher three veri good semblanc of
truth each man make hi own choic or rather perhap ha it
thrust upon him and thi choic whether it be thrust upon him or
whether as is often the case he have made it without due
reflect thi choic to which he cling will determin the form
and the conduct of all that enter within him the friend whom we
meet the woman who approach and smile the love that unlock our
heart the death or sorrow that seal it the septemb sky abov
us thi superb and delight garden wherein we see as in
corneil psych bower of greeneri rest on gild statu
and the flock graze yonder with their shepherd asleep and the
last hous of the villag and the sea between the treesal
these ar rais or degrad befor thei enter within us ar
adorn or despoil in accord with the littl signal thi
choic of our make to them we must learn to select from among
these semblanc of truth i have spent my own life in eager search
for the smaller truth the physic caus and now at the end of
my dai i begin to cherish not what would lead me from these but
what would preced them and abov all what would somewhat surpass
them we had attain the summit of a plateau in the pai de
caux in normandi which is suppl as an english park but natur
and limitless it is on of the rare spot on the globe where natur
reveal herself to us unfailingli wholesom and green a littl
further to the north the countri is threaten with barren a
littl further to the south it is fatigu and scorch by the sun
at the end of a plain that ran down to the edg of the sea some
peasant were erect a stack of corn look he said seen from
here thei ar beauti thei ar construct that simpl and yet
so import thing which is abov all els the happi and almost
unvari monument of human life take roota stack of corn the
distanc the air of the even weav their joyou cri into a
kind of song without word which repli to the nobl song of the
leav as thei whisper over our head abov them the sky is
magnific and on almost might fanci that benefic spirit
wave palmtre of fire had swept all the light toward the
stack to give the worker more time and the track of the palm
still remain in the sky see the humbl church by their side
overlook and watch them in the midst of the round lime
tree and the grass of the home graveyard that face it nativ
ocean thei ar fitli erect their monument of life underneath the
monument of their dead who made the same gestur and still ar
with them take in the whole pictur there ar no special
characterist featur such as we find in england provenc or
holland it is the present larg and ordinari enough to be
symbol of a natur and happi life observ how rhythmic human
exist becom in it us moment look at the man who is
lead the hors at that other who throw up the sheav on hi
fork at the women bend over the corn and the children at plai
thei have not displac a stone or remov a spade of
earth to add to the beauti of the sceneri nor do thei take on
step plant a tree or a flower that is not necessari all that we
see is mere the involuntari result of the effort that man put
forth to subsist for a moment in natur and yet those among us
whose desir is onli to creat or imagin spectacl of peac deep
thought or beatitud have been abl to find no scene more
perfect than thi which inde thei paint or describ whenev thei
seek to present us with a pictur of beauti or happi here we
have the first semblanc which some will call the truth
92
let us draw nearer can you distinguish the song that blend so
well with the whisper of the leav it is made up of abus and
insult and when laughter burst forth it is due to an obscen
remark some man or woman ha made to a jest at the expens of the
weakerof the hunchback unabl to lift hi load the crippl thei
have knock over or the idiot whom thei make their butt
i have studi these peopl for mani year we ar in normandi the
soil is rich and easili till around thi stack of corn there is
rather more comfort than on would usual associ with a scene of
thi kind the result is that most of the men and mani of the
women ar alcohol anoth poison also which i need not name
corrod the race to that to the alcohol ar due the children
whom you see there the dwarf the on with the harelip the other
who ar knockkne scroful imbecil all of them men and
women young and old have the ordinari vice of the peasant thei
ar brutal suspici grasp and enviou hypocrit liar
and slander inclin to petti illicit profit mean
interpret and coars flatteri of the stronger necess
bring them togeth and compel them to help each other but the
secret wish of everi individu is to harm hi neighbour as soon as
thi can be done without danger to himself the on substanti
pleasur of the villag is procur by the sorrow of other should
a great disast befal on of them it will long be the subject of
secret delight comment among the rest everi man watch hi
fellow is jealou of him detest and despis him while thei ar
poor thei hate their master with a boil and pentup hatr
becaus of the harsh and avaric these last displai should thei
in their turn have servant thei profit by their own experi of
servitud to reveal a harsh and avaric greater even than that
from which thei have suffer i could give you minutest detail of
the mean deceit injustic tyranni and malic that underli
thi pictur of ether peac toil do not imagin that the
sight of thi marvel sky of the sea which spread out yonder
behind the church and present anoth more sensit sky flow
over the earth like a great mirror of wisdom and consciousnessdo
not imagin that either sea or sky is capabl of lift their
thought or widen their mind thei have never look at them
noth ha power to influenc or move them save three or four
circumscrib fear that of hunger of forc of opinion and law
and the terror of hell when thei die to show what thei ar we
should have to consid them on by on see that tall fellow there
on the right who fling up such mighti sheav last summer hi
friend broke hi right arm in some tavern row i reduc the
fractur which wa a bad and compound on i tend him for a long
time and gave him the wherewith to live till he should be abl to
get back to work he came to me everi dai he profit by thi to
spread the report in the villag that he had discov me in the
arm of my sisterinlaw and that my mother drank he is not
viciou he bear me no illwil on the contrari see what a broad
open smile spread over hi face as he see me it wa not social
animos that induc him to slander me the peasant valu wealth
far too much to hate the rich man but i fanci my good cornthrow
there could not understand my tend him without ani profit to
myself he wa satisfi that there must be some underhand scheme
and he declin to be my dupe more than on befor him richer or
poorer ha act in similar fashion if not wors it did not occur
to him that he wa ly when he spread those invent abroad he
mere obei a confus command of the moral he saw about him
he yield unconsci against hi will as it were to the
allpow desir of the gener malevol but why
complet a pictur with which all ar familiar who have spent some
year in the countri here we have the second semblanc that some
will call the real truth it is the truth of practic life it
undoubtedli is base on the most precis the onli fact that on
can observ and test
93
let us sit on these sheav he continu and look again let us
reject not a singl on of the littl fact that build up the
realiti of which i have spoken let us permit them to depart of
their own accord into space thei cumber the foreground and yet we
cannot but be awar of the exist behind them of a great and veri
curiou forc that sustain the whole doe it onli sustain and not
rais these men whom we see befor us ar at least no longer the
feroci anim of whom la bruyer speak the wretch who talk
in a kind of inarticul voic and withdrew at night to their
den where thei live on black bread water and root
the race you will tell me is neither as strong nor as healthi
that mai be alcohol and the other scourg ar accid that
human ha to surmount ordeal it mai be by which certain of
our organ those of the nerv for instanc mai benefit for we
invari find that life profit by the ill that it overcom
besid a mere trifl that we mai discov tomorrow mai render
these poison innocu these men have thought and feel that
those of whom la bruyer speak had not i prefer the simpl
nake anim to the odiou halfanim i murmur you ar
think of the first semblanc now he repli the semblanc
dear to the poet that we saw befor let us not confus it with the
on we ar now consid these thought and feel ar petti
if you will and vile but what is petti and vile is still better
than that which is not at all of these thought and feel thei
avail themselv onli to hurt each other and to persist in their
present mediocr but thu doe it often happen in natur the
gift she accord ar emploi for evil at first for the render
wors what she had appar sought to improv but from thi
evil a certain good will alwai result in the end besid i am by
no mean anxiou to prove that there ha been progress which mai be
a veri small thing or a veri great thing accord to the place
whenc we regard it it is a vast achiev the surest ideal
perhap to render the condit of men a littl less servil a
littl less pain but let the mind detach itself for an instant
from materi result and the differ between the man who
march in the van of progress and the other who is blindli drag
at it tail ceas to be veri consider among these young
rustic whose mind is haunt onli by formless idea there ar
mani who have in themselv the possibl of attain in a short
space of time the degre of conscious that we both enjoi on
is often struck by the narrow of the divid line between what
we regard as the unconsci of these peopl and the
conscious that to us is the highest of all
besid of what is thi conscious compos whereof we ar so
proud of far more shadow than light of far more acquir ignor
than knowledg of far more thing whose comprehens we ar well
awar must ever elud us than of thing that we actual know and
yet in thi conscious li all our digniti our most verit
great it is probabl the most surpris phenomenon thi world
contain it is thi which permit us to rais our head befor the
unknown principl and sai to it what you ar i know not but
there is someth within me that alreadi enfold you you will
destroi me perhap but if your object be not to construct from my
ruin an organ better than mine you will prove yourself inferior
to what i am and the silenc that will follow the death of the race
to which i belong will declar to you that you have been judg and
if you ar not capabl even of care whether you be justli judg
or not of what valu can your secret be it must be stupid or
hideou chanc ha enabl you to produc a creatur that you
yourself lack the qualiti to produc it is fortun for him that
a contrari chanc should have permit you to suppress him befor
he had fathom the depth of your unconsci more fortun
still that he doe not surviv the infinit seri of your aw
experi he had noth to do in a world where hi intellect
correspond to no etern intellect where hi desir for the
better could attain no actual good
onc more for the spectacl to absorb us there is no need of
progress the enigma suffic and that enigma is as great and
shine as mysteri in the peasant as in ourselv as we trace
life back to it allpow principl it confront us on everi
side to thi principl each succeed centuri ha given a new
name some of these name were clear and consol it wa found
howev that consol and clear were alik illusori but
whether we call it god provid natur chanc life fatal
spirit or matter the mysteri remain unalt and from the
experi of thousand of year we have learn noth more than
to give it a vaster name on nearer to ourselv more congruou
with our expect with the unforeseen
that is the name it bear todai wherefor it ha never seem
greater here we have on of the numberless aspect of the third
semblanc which also is truth
vii the massacr of the male

but the patienc of the bee is not equal to that of men on

befor close thi booka we have close the hive on the torpid
silenc of winteri am anxiou to meet the object invari
urg by those to whom we reveal the astound industri and polici
of the bee ye thei will sai that is all veri wonder but
then it ha never been otherwis the bee have for thousand of

year the law have not vari for thousand of year thei have
construct their marvel comb whereto we can add noth
wherefrom we can take nothingcomb that unit in equal perfect
the scienc of the chemist the geometrician the architect and the

a singl fact that will show the least progress a singl instanc

not onli possess an admir instinct but have also an intellect
worthi to approach that of man worthi to share in on know not
what higher destini than await unconsci and submiss matter
thi languag is not even confin to the profan it is made us of
by entomologist of the rank of kirbi and spenc in order to deni
the bee the possess of intellect other than mai vagu stir
within the narrow prison of an extraordinari but unchang
instinct show us thei sai a singl case where the pressur of

we will admit their capac for reason
thi argument that roman refer to as the questionbeg
argument and that might also be term the insati argument
is exceedingli danger and if appli to man would take us veri
far examin it close and you find that it eman from the

that repli to galileo the earth doe not turn for i can see the

make an admir and necessari background for the mind but
unless it be watch by a lofti disquiet ever readi to remind it
when occas demand of the infin of it ignor it dwindl
into the mere routin of the baser side of our intellect but the
bee have themselv answer the object messr kirbi and spenc

andrew knight have cover the bark of some diseas tree with a

adopt and found in abund quantiti readi prepar in the

and inde onehalf of the scienc and practic of apicultur
consist in give free rein to the spirit of initi possess
by the bee and in provid their enterpris intellect with
opportun for verit discoveri and verit invent
thu for instanc to aid in the rear of the larva and nymph
the beekeep will scatter a certain quantiti of flour close to the
hive when the pollen is scarc of which these consum an enorm
quantiti in a state of natur in the heart of their nativ forest
in the asiat vallei where thei exist probabl long befor the
tertiari epoch the bee can evid never have met with a
substanc of thi kind and yet if care be taken to bait some of
them with it by place them on the flour thei will touch it and
test it thei will perceiv that it properti more or less
resembl those possess by the dust of the anther thei will
spread the new among their sister and we shall soon find everi

it is a littl more than a hundr year ago that huber research
gave the first seriou impetu to our studi of the bee and
reveal the elementari import truth that allow us to observ

reveal the precis secret of the princip organ of the worker
of the mother and the male need we wonder if our knowledg be as
scanti as our experi the bee have exist mani thousand of
year we have watch them for ten or twelv lustr and if it
could even be prove that no chang ha occur in the hive sinc
we first open it should we have the right to conclud that
noth had chang befor our first question glanc do we not
know that in the evolut of speci a centuri is but as a drop of
rain that is caught in the whirl of the river and that millenari
glide as swiftli over the life of univers matter as singl year
over the histori of a peopl
99
but there is no warrant for the statement that the habit of the
bee ar unchang if we examin them with an unbiass ey and
without emerg from the small area lit by our actual experi
we shall on the contrari discov mark variat and who shall
tell how mani escap us were an observ of a hundr and fifti
time our height and about seven hundr and fifti thousand time
our import these be the relat of statur and weight in
which we stand to the humbl honeyfli on who knew not our
languag and wa endow with sens total differ from our
own were such an on to have been studi us he would recognis
certain curiou materi transform in the cours of the last
two third of the centuri but would be total unabl to form ani
concept of our moral social polit econom or religi
evolut
the most like of all the scientif hypothes will present
permit us to connect our domest bee with the great tribe of the
apien which embrac all wild bee and where it ancestor ar
probabl to be found we shall then perceiv physiolog social
econom industri and architectur transform more
extraordinari than those of our human evolut but for the moment
we will limit ourselv to our domest bee properli so call of
these sixteen fairli distinct speci ar known but essenti
whether we consid the api dorsata the largest known to us or
the api florea which is the smallest the insect is alwai exactli
the same except for the slight modif induc by the climat
and by the condit whereto it ha had to conform
the scientif classif of the domest bee is as follow
class insecta
order hymenoptera
famili apida
genu api
speci mellifica
the term mellifica is that of the linnaean classif it is
not of the happiest for all the apida with the except of
certain parasit perhap ar produc of honei scopoli us the
term cerifera reaumur domestica geoffroi gregaria the
api ligustica the italian bee is anoth varieti of the
mellifica
the differ between these variou speci is scarc greater
than that between an englishman and a russian a japanes and a
european in these preliminari remark therefor we will confin
ourselv to what actual li within the rang of our ey
refus the aid of hypothesi be thi never so probabl or so
imperi we shall mention no fact that ar not suscept of
immedi proof and of such fact we will onli rapidli refer to
some of the more signific
100
let us consid first of all the most import and most radic
improv on that in the case of man would have call for
prodigi labour the extern protect of the commun
the bee do not like ourselv dwell in town free to the sky and
expos to the capric of rain and storm but in citi entir
cover with a protect envelop in a state of natur howev
in an ideal climat thi is not the case if thei listen onli to
their essenti instinct thei would construct their comb in the
open air in the indi the api dorsata will not eagerli seek
hollow tree or a hole in the rock the swarm will hang from the
crook of a branch and the comb will be lengthen the queen lai
her egg provis be store with no shelter other than that
which the worker own bodi provid our northern bee have at
time been known to revert to thi instinct under the decept
influenc of a too gentl sky and swarm have been found live in
the heart of a bush but even in the indi the result of thi
habit which would seem innat is by no mean favour so
consider a number of the worker ar compel to remain on on
spot occupi sole with the mainten of the heat requir by
those who ar mould the wax and rear the brood that the api
dorsata hang thu from the branch will construct but a singl
comb wherea if she have the least shelter she will erect four or
five or more and will proportion increas the prosper and
the popul of the coloni and inde we find that all speci of
bee exist in cold and temper region have abandon thi
primit method the intellig initi of the insect ha
evid receiv the sanction of natur select which ha
allow onli the most numer and best protect tribe to surviv
our winter what had been mere an idea therefor and oppos to
instinct ha thu by slow degre becom an instinct habit but
it is none the less true that in forsak the vast light of natur
that wa so dear to them and seek shelter in the obscur hollow
of a tree or a cavern the bee have follow what at first wa an
audaci idea base on observ probabl on experi and
reason and thi idea might be almost declar to have been as
import to the destini of the domest bee as wa the invent
of fire to the destini of man
101
thi great progress not the less actual for be hereditari and
ancient wa follow by an infinit varieti of detail which prove
that the industri and even the polici of the hive have not
crystallis into infrang formula we have alreadi mention
the intellig substitut of flour for pollen and of an
artifici cement for propoli we have seen with what skill the
bee ar abl to adapt to their need the occasion disconcert
dwell into which thei ar introduc and the surpris
adroit wherewith thei turn comb of foundationwax to good
account thei displai extraordinari ingenu in their manner of
handl these marvel comb which ar so strang us and
yet incomplet in point of fact thei meet man halfwai let us
imagin that we had for centuri past been erect citi not
with stone brick and lime but with some pliabl substanc
painfulli secret by special organ of our bodi on dai an
allpow be place us in the midst of a fabul citi we
recognis that it is made of a substanc similar to the on that we
secret but as regard the rest it is a dream whereof what is
logic is so distort so reduc and as it were concentr as
to be more disconcert almost than had it been incoher our
habitu plan is there in fact we find everyth that we had
expect but all ha been put togeth by some anteced forc
that would seem to have crush it arrest it in the mould and to
have hinder it complet the hous whose height must attain
some four or five yard ar the merest protuber that our two
hand can cover thousand of wall ar indic by sign that hint
at onc of their plan and materi elsewher there ar mark
deviat which must be correct gap to be fill and
harmoni join to the rest vast surfac that ar unstabl and
will need support the enterpris is hope but full of hardship
and danger it would seem to have been conceiv by some sovereign
intellig that wa abl to divin most of our desir but ha
execut them clumsili be hamper by it veri vast we must
disentangl therefor what now is obscur we must develop the
least intent of the supernatur donor we must build in a few
dai what would ordinarili take us year we must renounc organ
habit and fundament alter our method of labour it is certain
that all the attent man could devot would not be excess for
the solut of the problem that would aris or for the turn to
fullest account the help thu offer by a magnific provid
yet that is more or less what the bee ar do in our modern
hive
as we ar now concern with the construct of the bee
we mai note in pass a strang peculiar of the api
florea certain wall of it cell for male ar cylindr
instead of hexagon appar she ha not yet succeed
in pass from on form to the other and indefinit
adopt the better
102
i have said that even the polici of the bee is probabl subject to
chang thi point is the obscurest of all and the most difficult
to verifi i shall not dwell on their variou method of treat
the queen or the law as to swarm that ar peculiar to the
inhabit of everi hive and appar transmit from
gener to gener etc but by the side of these fact which
ar not suffici establish ar other so precis and unvari
as to prove that the same degre of polit civilis ha not
been attain by all race of the domest bee and that among some
of them the public spirit still is grope it wai seek perhap
anoth solut of the royal problem the syrian bee for instanc
habitu rear 120 queen and often more wherea our api
mellifica will rear ten or twelv at most cheshir tell of a
syrian hive in no wai abnorm where 120 dead queenmoth were
found and 90 live unmolest queen thi mai be the point of
departur or the point of arriv of a strang social evolut
which it would be interest to studi more thoroughli we mai add
that as far as the rear of queen is concern the cyprian bee
approxim to the syrian and final there is yet anoth fact
which establish still more clearli that the custom and prudent
organis of the hive ar not the result of a primit impuls
mechan follow through differ ag and climat but that
the spirit which govern the littl republ is fulli as capabl of
take note of new condit and turn these to the best
advantag as in time long past it wa capabl of meet the
danger that hem it around transport our black bee to california
or australia and her habit will complet alter find that
summer is perpetu and flower forev abund she will after on
or two year be content to live from dai to dai and gather
suffici honei and pollen for the dai consumpt and her
thought observ of these new featur triumph over
hereditari experi she will ceas to make provis for the
winter in fact it becom necessari in order to stimul her
activ to depriv her systemat of the fruit of her labour
buchner cite an analog fact in the barbado the bee
whose hive ar in the midst of the refineri where thei
find sugar in abund dure the whole year will entir
abandon their visit to the flower
103
so much for what our own ey can see it will be admit that we
have mention some curiou fact which by no mean support the
theori that everi intellig is arrest everi futur clearli
defin save onli the intellig and futur of man
but if we choos to accept for on moment the hypothesi of

soon attain our own destini whoever bring care attent to

possibl the quantiti of matter that ha rais itself from it

admit but the onli on we can make on the hidden forc that lead
us and it stand for much in a world where confid in life
until certitud to the contrari reach us must remain the first of
all our duti at time even when life itself convei no
encourag clear to us
i know all that mai be urg against the theori of evolut in it

not carri irresist convict we must bewar of abandon

thi truth will appear as ancient as the philosoph write of
the eighteenth centuri seem to us now full as thei ar of a too
perfect and nonexist man or as so mani work of the seventeenth
centuri whose valu is lessen by their concept of a harsh and
narrow god
nevertheless when it is imposs to know what the truth of a

most urgent to the reason of men at the period when we happen to
have come into the world the chanc ar that it will be fals but
so long as we believ it to be true it will serv a us purpos

but when we come to the panurgi which ar cousin of the dasypoda
a littl rai of light suddenli reveal the birth of a new sentiment
in thi fortuit crowd thei collect in the same wai as the
other and each on dig it own subterranean chamber but the
entranc is common to all as also the galleri which lead from the
surfac of the ground to the differ cell and thu m perez
add as far as the work of the cell is concern each bee act
as though she were alon but all make equal us of the galleri that
conduct to the cell so that the multitud profit by the labour
of an individu and ar spare the time and troubl requir for
the construct of separ galleri it would be interest to
discov whether thi preliminari work be not execut in common by
relai of femal reliev each other in turn
howev thi mai be the fratern idea ha pierc the wall that
divid two world it is no longer wild and unrecognis wrest
from instinct by cold and hunger or by the fear of death it is
prompt by activ life but it halt onc more and in thi
instanc arriv no further no matter it doe not lose courag it
will seek other channel it enter the humblebe and matur
there becom embodi in a differ atmospher and work it
first decis miracl
the humblebe the great hairi noisi creatur that all of us
know so well so harmless for all their appar fierc lead a
solitari life at first at the begin of march the impregn
femal who ha surviv the winter start to construct her nest
either underground or in a bush accord to the speci to which
she belong she is alon in the world in the midst of awaken
spring she choos a spot clear it dig it and carpet it then
she erect her somewhat shapeless waxen cell store these with
honei and pollen lai and hatch the egg tend and nourish the
larva that spring to life and soon is surround by a troop of
daughter who aid her in all her labour within the nest and
without while some of them soon begin to lai in their turn the
construct of the cell improv the coloni grow the comfort
increas the foundress is still it soul it princip mother
and find herself now at the head of a kingdom which might be the
model of that of our honeybe but the model is still in the rough
the prosper of the humblebe never exce a certain limit
their law ar illdefin and illobei primit cannib and
infanticid reappear at interv the architectur is shapeless and
entail much wast of materi but the cardin differ between
the two citi is that the on is perman and the other
ephemer for inde that of the humblebe will perish in the
autumn it three or four hundr inhabit will die leav no
trace of their passag or their endeavour and but a singl femal
will surviv who the next spring in the same solitud and poverti
as her mother befor her will recomm the same useless work the
idea howev ha now grown awar of it strength among the
humblebe it goe no further than we have state but faith to
it habit and pursu it usual routin it will immedi
undergo a sort of unweari metempsychosi and reincarn
itself trembl with it last triumph render allpow now
and nearli perfect in anoth group the last but on of the race
that which immedi preced our domest bee wherein it attain
it crown the group of the meliponita which compris the
tropic melipona and trigona
108
here the organis is as complet as in our hive there is an
uniqu mother there ar steril worker and male certain detail
even seem better devis the male for instanc ar not wholli
idl thei secret wax the entranc to the hive is more carefulli
guard it ha a door that can be close when night ar cold and
when these ar warm a kind of curtain will admit the air
but the republ is less strong gener life less assur
prosper more limit than with our bee and wherev these ar
introduc the meliponita tend to disappear befor them in both
race the fratern idea ha undergon equal and magnific
develop save in on point alon wherein it achiev no further
advanc among the meliponita than among the limit offspr of
the humblebe in the mechan organis of distribut
labour in the precis economi of effort briefli in the
architectur of the citi thei displai manifest inferior as to
thi i need onli refer to what i said in section 42 of thi book
while ad that wherea in the hive of our apita all the cell
ar equal avail for the rear of the brood and the storag
of provis and endur as long as the citi itself thei serv
onli on of these purpos among the meliponita and the cell
emploi as cradl for the nymph ar destroi after these have
been hatch
it is not certain that the principl of uniqu royalti or
matern is strictli observ among the meliponita
blanchard remark veri justli that as thei possess no sting
and ar consequ less readili abl than the mother of
our own bee to kill each other sever queen will
probabl live togeth in the same hive but certainti on
thi point ha hitherto been unattain ow to the great
resembl that exist between queen and worker as also
to the imposs of rear the meliponita in our
climat
it is in our domest bee therefor that the idea of whose
movement we have given a cursori and incomplet pictur attain
it most perfect form ar these movement definit and for all
time arrest in each on of these speci and doe the
connectinglin exist in our imagin alon let us not be too
eager to establish a system in thi illexplor region let our
conclus be onli provision and preferenti such as convei
the utmost hope for were a choic forc upon us occasion
gleam would appear to declar that the infer we ar most
desir to draw will prove to be truest besid let us not forget
that our ignor still is profound we ar onli learn to open
our ey a thousand experi that could be made have as yet not
even been tri if the prosop for instanc were imprison and
forc to cohabit with their kind would thei in cours of time
overstep the iron barrier of total solitud and be satisfi to
live the common life of the dasypoda or to put forth the fratern
effort of the panurgi and if we impos abnorm condit upon
the panurgi would these in their turn progress from a gener
corridor to gener cell if the mother of the humblebe were
compel to hibern togeth would thei arriv at a mutual
understand a mutual divis of labour have comb of
foundationwax been offer to the meliponita would thei accept
them would thei make us of them would thei conform their habit
to thi unwont architectur question these that we put to veri
tini creatur and yet thei contain the great word of our greatest
secret we cannot answer them for our experi date but from
yesterdai start with reaumur about a hundr and fifti year
have elaps sinc the habit of wild bee first receiv attent
reaumur wa acquaint with onli a few of them we have sinc then
observ a few more but hundr thousand perhap have hitherto
been notic onli by hasti and ignor travel the habit of
those that ar known to us have undergon no chang sinc the author
of the memoir publish hi valuabl work and the humblebe
all powder with gold and vibrant as the sun delect murmur
that in the year 1730 gorg themselv with honei in the garden of
charenton were absolut ident with those that tomorrow when
april return will be hum in the wood of vincenn but a few
yard awai from reaumur dai to our own howev is but as the
twinkl of an ey and mani live of men place end to end form
but a second in the histori of natur thought
109
although the idea that our ey have follow attain it suprem
express in our domest bee it must not be infer therefrom
that the hive reveal no fault there is on masterpiec the
hexagon cell that touch absolut perfectiona perfect that
all the genius in the world were thei to meet in conclav could
in no wai enhanc no live creatur not even man ha achiev
in the centr of hi sphere what the bee ha achiev in her own
and were some on from anoth world to descend and ask of the earth
the most perfect creation of the logic of life we should need have
to offer the humbl comb of honei
but the level of thi perfect is not maintain throughout we
have alreadi dealt with a few fault and shortcom evid
sometim and sometim mysteri such as the ruinou
superabund and idl of the male parthenogenesi the
peril of the nuptial flight excess swarm the absenc of
piti and the almost monstrou sacrific of the individu to
societi to these must be ad a strang inclin to store
enorm mass of pollen far in excess of their need for the
pollen soon turn rancid and harden encumb the surfac of
the comb and further the long steril interregnum between the date
of the first swarm and the impregn of the second queen etc
etc
of these fault the gravest the onli on which in our climat is
invari fatal is the repeat swarm but here we must bear in
mind that the natur select of the domest bee ha for
thousand of year been thwart by man from the egyptian of the
time of pharaoh to the peasant of our own dai the beekeep ha
alwai act in opposit to the desir and advantag of the
race the most prosper hive ar those which throw onli on swarm
after the begin of summer thei have fulfil their matern
duti assur the mainten of the stock and the necessari
renew of queen thei have guarante the futur of the swarm
which be precoci and ampl in number ha time to erect
solid and wellstor dwell befor the arriv of autumn if
left to themselv it is clear that these hive and their offshoot
would have been the onli on to surviv the rigour of winter
which would almost invari have destroi coloni anim by
differ instinct and the law of restrict swarm would
therefor by slow degre have establish itself in our northern
race but it is precis these prudent opul acclimatis
hive that man ha alwai destroi in order to possess himself of
their treasur he ha permit onlyh doe so to thi dai in
ordinari practiceth feeblest coloni to surviv degener
stock secondari or tertiari swarm which have just bare
suffici food to subsist through the winter or whose miser
store he will supplement perhap with a few drop of honei the
result is probabl that the race ha grown feebler that the
tendenc to excess swarm ha been hereditarili develop and
that todai almost all our bee particularli the black on swarm
too often for some year now the new method of movabl
apicultur have gone some wai toward correct thi danger
habit and when we reflect how rapidli artifici select act on
most of our domest anim such as oxen dog pigeon sheep and
hors it is permiss to believ that we shall befor long have
a race of bee that will entir renounc natur swarm and
devot all their activ to the collect of honei and pollen
110
but for the other fault might not an intellig that possess a
clearer conscious of the aim of common life emancip itself
from them much might be said concern these fault which eman
now from what is unknown to us in the hive now from swarm and
it result error for which we ar partli to blame but let
everi man judg for himself and have seen what ha gone befor
let him grant or deni intellig to the bee as he mai think
proper i am not eager to defend them it seem to me that in mani
circumst thei give proof of understand but my curios
would not be less were all that thei do done blindli it is
interest to watch a brain possess of extraordinari resourc
within itself wherewith it mai combat cold and hunger death time
space and solitud all the enemi of matter that is spring to
life but should a creatur succe in maintain it littl
profound and complic exist without overstep the
boundari of instinct without do anyth but what is ordinari
that would be veri interest too and veri extraordinari restor
the ordinari and the marvel to their verit place in the
bosom of natur and their valu shift on equal the other we
find that their name ar usurp and that it is not thei but the
thing we cannot understand or explain that should arrest our
attent refresh our activ and give a new and juster form to
our thought and feel and word there is wisdom in attach
oneself to nought besid
111
and further our intellect is not the proper tribun befor which
to summon the bee and pass their fault in review do we not find
among ourselv that conscious and intellect long will dwell in
the midst of error and fault without perceiv them longer still
without effect a remedi if a be exist whom hi destini call
upon most special almost organ to live and to organis
common life in accord with pure reason that be is man and
yet see what he make of it compar the mistak of the hive with
those of our own societi how should we marvel for instanc were
we bee observ men as we note the unjust illog
distribut of work among a race of creatur that in other
direct appear to manifest emin reason we should find the
earth surfac uniqu sourc of all common life insuffici
painfulli cultiv by two or three tenth of the whole popul
we should find anoth tenth absolut idl usurp the larger
share of the product of thi first labour and the remain
sevententh condemn to a life of perpetu halfhung
ceaselessli exhaust themselv in strang and steril effort
wherebi thei never shall profit but onli shall render more complex
and more inexplic still the life of the idl we should conclud
that the reason and moral sens of these be must belong to a
world entir differ from our own and that thei must obei
principl hopelessli beyond our comprehens but let us carri
thi review of our fault no further thei ar alwai present in our
thought though their presenc achiev but littl from centuri to
centuri onli will on of them for a moment shake off it slumber
and send forth a bewild cry stretch the ach arm that
support it head shift it posit and then lie down and fall
asleep onc more until a new pain born of the dreari fatigu of
repos awaken it afresh
112
the evolut of the apien or at least of the apita be
admit or regard as more probabl than that thei should have
remain stationari let us now consid the gener constant
direct that thi evolut take it seem to follow the same
road as with ourselv it tend palpabl to lessen the struggl
insecur and wretched of the race to augment author and
comfort and stimul favour chanc to thi end it will
unhesitatingli sacrific the individu bestow gener strength
and happi in exchang for the illusori and mourn independ
of solitud it is as though natur were of the opinion with which
thucydid credit pericl viz that individu ar happier in
the bosom of a prosper citi even though thei suffer themselv
than when individu prosper in the midst of a languish
state it protect the hardwork slave in the power citi while
those who have no duti whose associ is onli precari ar
abandon to the nameless formless enemi who dwell in the minut
of time in the movement of the univers and in the recess of
space thi is not the moment to discuss the scheme of natur or to
ask ourselv whether it would be well for man to follow it but it
is certain that wherev the infinit mass allow us to seiz the
appear of an idea the appear take thi road whereof we
know not the end let it be enough that we note the persist care
with which natur preserv and fix in the evolv race all
that ha been won from the hostil inertia of matter she record
each happi effort and contriv we know not what special and
benevol law to counteract the inevit recoil thi progress
whose exist among the most intellig speci can scarc be
deni ha perhap no aim beyond it initi impetu and know not
whither it goe but at least in a world where noth save a few
fact of thi kind indic a precis will it is signific
enough that we should see certain creatur rise thu slowli and
continu and should the bee have reveal to us onli thi
mysteri spiral of light in the overpow dark that were
enough to induc us not to regret the time we have given to their
littl gestur and humbl habit which seem so far awai and ar
yet so nearli akin to our grand passion and arrog destini
113
it mai be that these thing ar all vain and that our own spiral of
light no less than that of the bee ha been kindl for no other
purpos save that of amus the dark so too is it possibl
that some stupend incid mai suddenli surg from without from
anoth world from a new phenomenon and either inform thi effort
with definit mean or definit destroi it but we must
proce on our wai as though noth abnorm could ever befal us
did we know that tomorrow some revel a messag for instanc
from a more ancient more lumin planet than our were to root up
our natur to suppress the law the passion and radic truth
of our be our wisest plan still would be to devot the whole of
todai to the studi of these passion these law and these truth
which must blend and accord in our mind and to remain faith to
the destini impos on us which is to subdu and to some extent
rais within and around us the obscur forc of life
none of these perhap will surviv the new revel but the
soul of those who shall up to the end have fulfil the mission
that is preemin the mission of man must inevit be in the
front rank of all to welcom thi revel and should thei learn
therefrom that indiffer or resign to the unknown is the
verit duti thei will be better equip than the other for the
comprehens of thi final resign and indiffer better
abl to turn these to account
114
but such specul mai well be avoid let not the possibl
of gener annihil blur our percept of the task befor us
abov all let us not count on the miracul aid of chanc
hitherto the promis of our imagin notwithstand we have
alwai been left to ourselv to our own resourc it is to our
humblest effort that everi us endur achiev of thi
earth is due it is open to us if we choos to await the better or
wors that mai follow some alien accid but on condit that
such expect shall not hinder our human task here again do the
bee as natur alwai provid a most excel lesson in the hive
there ha truli been prodigi intervent the bee ar in the
hand of a power capabl of annihil or modifi their race of
transform their destini the bee thraldom is far more
definit than our own therefor none the less do thei perform their
profound and primit duti and among them it is precis those
whose obedi to duti is most complet who ar abl most fulli to
profit by the supernatur intervent that todai ha rais the
destini of their speci and inde to discov the unconquer
duti of a be is less difficult than on imagin it is ever to
be read in the distinguish organ whereto the other ar all
subordin and just as it is written in the tongu the stomach
and mouth of the bee that it must make honei so is it written in
our ey our ear our nerv our marrow in everi lobe of our
head that we must make cerebr substanc nor is there need that
we should divin the purpos thi substanc shall serv the bee
know not whether thei will eat the honei thei harvest as we know
not who it is shall reap the profit of the cerebr substanc we
shall have form or of the intellig fluid that issu therefrom
and spread over the univers perish when our life ceas or
persist after our death as thei go from flower to flower
collect more honei than themselv and their offspr can
need let us go from realiti to realiti seek food for the
incomprehens flame and thu certain of have fulfil our
organ duti prepar ourselv for whatev befal let us
nourish thi flame on our feel and passion on all that we see
and think that we hear and touch on it own essenc which is the
idea it deriv from the discoveri experi and observ
that result from it everi movement a time then will come when all
thing will turn so natur to good in a spirit that ha given
itself to the loyal desir of thi simpl human duti that the veri
suspicion of the possibl aimless of it exhaust effort will
onli render the duti the clearer will onli add more puriti power
disinterested and freedom to the ardour wherewith it still
seek
